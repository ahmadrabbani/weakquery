A key aspect of its mission is to be a leader in environmental stewardship, and the company has an ongoing commitment to green power. Under the guidance of Green Mission Task Force Leader Michael Besancon, Whole Foods Market has made green power purchasing a company-wide practice. Whole Foods Market's strategy to invest in green power is based on decisions made at the store or regional level. The regional-based decisions empower Whole Foods Market's Team Members to make decisions locally for their own stores or regions and also stay in tune with the environmental priorities of each particular community served by Whole Foods Market. Most of the publicity for green power purchases occurs at the regional level. And as one example, in the Rocky Mountain region, Whole Foods Market's efforts have included in-store educational information about wind energy. Whole Foods received the EPA Green Power Leadership Award in 2004 and 2005 and Partner of the Year award in 2006, 2007 and 2010, and continues to be a member of the Green Power Leadership Club. Whole Foods Market also hosts and/or owns solar energy systems at 15 locations and has contracted for up to 20 more, and hosts a fuel cell at four of its stores. In addition, Whole Foods Market has implemented energy efficiency upgrades saving more than 20 million kWh annually and has implemented many green building and minimum energy efficiency standards into new store designs.
