The good news is that in the U.S. it's going to be eligible for a federal tax credit of $1,300, and since this is Hyundai's first hybrid sold there, the company still has enough credits for 60,000 hybrids. But there's a bad news... Photo: Hyundai  The federal tax credit for hybrid cars expires on December 31st, 2010. This means that there will only be a short window for Sonata hybrid buyers to get that government rebate, and you can't get it on a Ford or Toyota hybrid because both companies have run out of credits. Why Only $1,300? The Sonata hybrid has a similar EPA rating to the Ford Fusion hybrid, but the Fusion had a $3,400 tax credit. Why the difference? Because the tax credit is based on city MPG, where the Fusion really shines (41 MPG).
