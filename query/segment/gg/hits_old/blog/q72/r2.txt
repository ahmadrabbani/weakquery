(Updated Oct. 28, 2010) Additional Requirements more... The following requirements must be met to claim the credit: The original use of the vehicle commences with the taxpayer. The vehicle is acquired for use or lease by the taxpayer, and not for resale. (The credit is only available to the original purchaser of a new, qualifying vehicle. If a qualifying vehicle is leased to a consumer, the leasing company may claim the credit.) The vehicle is used mostly in the United States. The vehicle must be placed in service by the taxpayer after December 31, 2005 and must be purchased on or before December 31, 2010.

However,  beginning in 2009 , the credit can be applied against the AMT.   Phase Out & Termination more...  The credit begins to phase out for a manufacturer's vehicles once it sells a total of 60,000 eligible hybrid and lean-burn (e.g., diesel) vehicles starting from January 1, 2006. IRS will announce when a manufacturer exceeds this sales figure.  In addition to the phase out rules, any vehicle purchased after December 31, 2010 will not be eligible for the credit.   Claiming the Credit more... Fill out  Form 8910 , Alternative Motor Vehicle Credit.   For hybrids acquired for personal use, report the credit from  Form 8910 on the appropriate line of your  Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return .   Other Tax Incentives more...
