Generally, for a passenger car or light truck that is a qualified hybrid vehicle, a taxpayer may rely on the manufacturer’s certification that a specific make, model and model year vehicle qualifies for the credit and the amount of the credit for which it qualifies.³ Even though a manufacturer has certified a vehicle, a taxpayer must meet the following requirements to qualify for the credit: The vehicle must be placed in service after 12-31-05 and purchased on or before 12-31-10.   The original use of the vehicle must begin with the taxpayer claiming the credit. a. The credit may only be claimed by the original owner of a new, qualifying, hybrid vehicle and does not apply to a used hybrid vehicle.   The vehicle must be acquired for use or lease by the taxpayer claiming the credit. a. The credit is only available to the original purchaser of a qualifying hybrid vehicle. If a qualifying vehicle is leased to a consumer, the leasing company may claim the credit. b. For qualifying vehicles used by a tax-exempt entity, the person who sold the qualifying vehicle to the person or entity using the vehicle is eligible to claim the credit, but only if the seller clearly discloses in a document to the tax-exempt entity the amount of credit.   The vehicle must be used predominantly within the United States.    Credit Phase Out The new qualified hybrid motor vehicle credit begins to phase out in the second calendar quarter after the calendar quarter in which at least 60,000 of the manufacturer’s qualifying passenger automobiles and light trucks have been sold.  Notice 2006-9 requires manufacturers that have received acknowledgement of its certification must submit to the Service a report of the number of qualified vehicles sold to a retail dealer during the calendar quarter. For this purpose, qualified vehicles are any passenger automobile or light truck that is a new advanced lean bury technology motor vehicle or a qualified hybrid motor vehicle. After review of the quarterly reports, the Service will issue an acknowledgement letter to the vehicle manufacturer stating whether purchasers many continue to rely on the certification. Notice 2006-78  announced the credit phase out schedule for advanced lean burn technology vehicles and hybrid vehicles manufactured by Toyota Motor Sales USA, Inc. (Toyota and Lexus vehicles). For the period of 10-1-06 to 3-31-07, purchasers of qualifying vehicles are eligible for 50% of the allowable credit. For the period of 4-1-07 to 9-30-07, purchasers of qualifying vehicles are eligible for 25% of the allowable credit. The table below includes both the full credit and the reduced credit amount depending upon when the vehicle was purchased. The date of purchase determines the amount of the credit available for a vehicle, i.e. whether a vehicle is eligible for the full credit or whether a portion of the credit is phased-out. The placed in service date determines the taxable year in which the credit may be claimed.   For example, if consumer A purchases a Prius on Sept. 30, 2006, and takes possession in February 2007, consumer A can claim the full credit for 2007, the year in which the vehicle is placed in service. On the other hand, if consumer B purchases a Prius on Oct. 1, 2006, and takes possession of the vehicle in February 2007, Consumer B can claim 50% of the credit in 2007, the year in which the vehicle is placed in service. Eligible Vehicles As of Dec. 14, 2006, the Internal Revenue Service had acknowledged the manufacturers’ certifications of the following qualified hybrid vehicles (arranged by model year) and credit amounts (additional vehicles may subsequently be acknowledged. Further acknowledgements will be included in a revised summary page):  * Effective 10-1-06, Toyota and Lexus vehicles qualify for reduced credit amounts.  2008     Make    Model    Credit Amount    News Release #     Ford   Escape Hybrid 2WD   $3,000  IR 2007-22, Jan. 31, 2007    Ford  Escape Hybrid 4WD  $2,220  IR 2007-22, Jan. 31, 2007     Mercury   Mariner Hybrid 2 WD   $3,000    IR 2007-22, Jan. 31, 2007     Mercury   Mariner Hybrid 4WD   $2,200    IR 2007-22,   Jan. 31, 2007      2007    Make   Model   Credit Amount   News Release #    Chevrolet  Silverado 2WD Hybrid Pickup Truck  $  250   IR-2006-108, July 11, 2006       Chevrolet  Silverado 4WD Hybrid Pickup Truck  $  650   IR-2006-108, July 11, 2006       Ford  Escape Hybrid 2WD  $2,600   IR-2006-98, June 21, 2006     Ford  Escape Hybrid 4WD  $1,950   IR-2006-98, June 21, 2006     GMC  Sierra 2WD Hybrid Pickup Truck  $  250   IR-2006-108, July 11, 2006     GMC  Sierra 4WD Hybrid Pickup Truck  $  650   IR-2006-108, July 11, 2006     Honda  Accord AT  $1,300  IR 2006-183, Nov. 22, 2006    Honda  Accord Navi  $1,300  IR 2006-183, Nov. 22, 2006    Honda  Civic CVT  $2,100  IR 2006-183, Nov. 22, 2006    Lexus*  GS450h  Purchase Date      IR-2006–67, April 25, 2006        1-1-06 / 9-30-06  $1,550   10-1-06 / 3-31-07  $   775   4-1-07 / 9-30-07  $   387.50   10-1-07  $       0   Lexus *  RX 400h 4WD  Purchase Date       IR-2006-154, Sept. 30, 2006     1-1-06 / 9-30-06  $2,200   10-1-06 / 3-31-07  $1,100   4-1-07 / 9-30-07  $   550   10-1-07  $       0   Lexus*  RX 400h 2WD  Purchase Date       IR-2006-154, Sept. 30, 2006     1-1-06 / 9-30-06  $2,200   10-1-06 / 3-31-07  $1,100   4-1-07 / 9-30-07  $   550   10-1-07  $       0   Mercury  Mariner Hybrid 4WD  $1,950   IR-2006-98, June 21, 2006     Saturn  Vue Green Line  $  650  IR-2006-110, July 11, 2006     Toyota*  Camry Hybrid  Purchase Date      IR-2006–67, April 25, 2006        1-1-06 / 9-30-06  $2,600   10-1-06 / 3-31-07  $1,300   4-1-07 / 9-30-07  $   650   10-1-07  $       0    Toyota*  Prius  Purchase Date       IR-2006-154, Sept. 30, 2006     1-1-06 / 9-30-06  $3,150   10-1-06 / 3-31-07  $1,575   4-1-07 /9-30-07  $   787.50   10-1-07  $       0    Toyota*  Highlander Hybrid 2WD  Purchase Date       IR-2006-154, Sept. 30, 2006     1-1-06 / 9-30-06  $2,600   10-1-06 / 3-31-07  $1,300   4-1-07 / 9-30-07  $   650   10-1-07  $       0    Toyota*  Highlander Hybrid 4WD  Purchase Date        IR-2006-154, Sept. 30, 2006        2006  Make   Model   Credit Amount   News Release #    Chevrolet  Silverado 2WD Hybrid Pickup Truck                 $  250   IR-2006-108, July 11. 2006                 Chevrolet  Silverado 4WD Hybrid Pickup Truck  $  650   IR-2006-108, July 11. 2006     Ford  Escape Hybrid 2WD Front Wheel Drive  $2,600  IR-2006-56, April 7, 2006    Ford  Escape Hybrid 4WD   $1,950  IR-2006-56, April 7, 2006    GMC  Sierra 2WD Hybrid Pickup Truck  $  250   IR-2006-108, July 11. 2006     GMC  Sierra 4WD Hybrid Pickup Truck  $  650   IR-2006-108, July 11. 2006     Honda  Accord Hybrid AT w/updated calibration*  $1,300 $  650 -

If the qualifying hybrid vehicle is purchased for business use, the credit for the business use of a qualifying hybrid vehicle is reported on  Form 3800 , General Business Credit. For qualifying hybrid vehicles acquired for personal use, the credit is reported on the appropriate line of the taxpayer’s  Form 1040 , U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. For additional information on the proper reporting of the alternative motor vehicle credit, see the instructions to Form 8910 on page two of the form. ¹ IRC §30B potentially allows a credit for four separate categories of vehicles: 1) Fuel Cell vehicles, 2) Advanced Lean Burn Technology vehicles, 3) Hybrid vehicles and 4) Alternative Fuel vehicles.   ² The deduction allowable for certain hybrid vehicles under IRC §179A is no longer available for vehicles placed in service after December 31, 2005.    ³ If the Internal Revenue Service publishes an announcement that the certification for any specific vehicle has been withdrawn, taxpayers cannot rely on the certification for such a vehicle purchased after the date of publication of the withdrawal announcement.
