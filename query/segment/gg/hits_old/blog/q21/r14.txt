Martin Luther King, Jr., has passed awawy.  Reference:  WXIA 11Alive.com - Coretta Scott King Dies  I'm not usually one for omens, but the serendipidy of the passing of Mrs. King on the very day that Sam Alito will be voted onto the Supreme Court, and the President, enjoying the lowest approval ratings since the year Nixon was elected and MLK gave his "I Have a Dream" speech, will accept the applause of a Joint Session of Congress to deliver his State of the Union Address -- is indeed ominous.
