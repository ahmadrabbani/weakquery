Main Street Any Town, US 55555 Dear Mr.  HR Manager :  At the suggestion of Chase Jett, CEO of Promotions On Steroids, I am contact you to see if USA's Favorite Things needs a renaissance brand marketing executive to run its North Americas Division.   Sample Resume Samples     As Chase will attest -- I am a brand management specialist with a shining career path spanning 23 years who has the consultative expertise to drive awareness for consumer products, taking products from oblivion to household names.  How shiny you ask? Let's put it this way -- I have my own brand in the marketing world -- that everything I promote turns to golden opportunities for my clients.    I know what takes to make people tick -- some like television, some respond to infomercials, and some like to see what they're looking for online.   Whether running TV spots, executing online or print ad campaigns, I have the unique blend of the "Madison Avenue" mentality and that of today's young text-driven consumers that I combine to create brand messaging campaigns good enough to run on Super Bowl Sunday!  I am not going to give the store away here and now, but would love to meet with you to see if we are like-minded and share the same ideals.   I warn you -- I am a force to recon with, so I need to work with people who can give me the room I need and trust my instincts.     I've provided you with enough in my resume to give you a good sense of what I have done and can do for your company.   If my genius is what your company is looking for to bring your products into the homes and minds of today's consumer, I'm your guy. Let's talk.
