 Winter Olympics for Kids

  Winter Olympics for Kids     "The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph, but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered, but to have fought well." Olympic Creed   Every four years the world celebrates "In the name of all competitors, I promise that we shall take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules that govern them, in the true spirit of sportsmanship, for the glory of sport and the honour of our teams." And so the games begin.   We've been studying different Winter Olympic sports for two months. We chose a sport and wrote about it and made an illustration to go along with it. We also made some activities for our visitors to have fun with. We hope you have a good time reading our work and playing our games. Don't forget to watch for your favorite sport on television during the next Winter Olympic Games.     by Samantha & Anita   4th Grade-2001 Pocantico Hills School Sleepy Hollow, NY  About the Winter Olympics    Winter Olympics Events     Flash Animation of the Winter Olympic Disciplines      Vote for your favorite Winter Olympic Sport    Activities     Vancouver Cyberhunt    Ancient Olympic Cyberhunt    Scholastic Olympic Cyberhunt    We've Got mail!     Links to more Information about the Olympics    Awards     Summer Olympics         You are visitor #           since November 4, 2001.
