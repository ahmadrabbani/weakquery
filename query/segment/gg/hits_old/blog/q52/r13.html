						<p>Early in these <a href="http://www.vancouver2010.com/">Winter Olympics </a> a furore was caused by a journalist <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/feb/15/vancouver-winter-olympics-2010">asking if these Games were turning out to be the worst Winter Olympics ever</a>.</p>

<p>Now I'm ready to pose another question, which will probably provoke just as much debate. Have these actually been the best Winter Olympics ever?</p>

<p>Let me clarify that question a little. In many ways there are always two parallel Olympics which take place - the one that viewers around the world <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sol/shared/bsp/hi/winter_olympics_2010/epg/html/epg.stm">watch on TV</a>, and the one that <a href="http://twitpic.com/14n29o">spectators come to a city to enjoy in person</a>.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/default.stm">Beijing Olympics </a>were considered to be a great success by the international television audience, whereas many people who witnessed the Games at first hand <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26361423/">complained about the lack of atmosphere </a>in the Chinese capital.<br />
</p>
						


						
						     <div id="more" class="asset-more">
						        <p>I was in Beijing, and I can assure you that you simply cannot compare the spectator experience there with the one here in Vancouver. Vancouver wins hands down.</p>

<p>In Beijing there was little buzz around the city. Yes, they were a fantastic Games in terms of quality of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/olympics_map/default.stm">venues</a> and competition, but not in terms of the amount of fun that people were having. Here the street party began on the opening night and it shows no signs of coming to an end just yet.</p>

<p>One senior official from <a href="http://www.london2012.com/">London 2012</a>, who's been in Vancouver, told me that she's learned more from five days in Canada than she had from three weeks in China. That's because, in terms of spectator experience, London will be looking to follow the Vancouver model.</p>

<p>I haven't seen much of the TV coverage, so it's hard for me to judge what your personal opinions of these Olympics will be, but I hope that many of you will write your views here.</p>

<p>In the meantime I'll focus on my experience of the Games, having now spent nearly three weeks in Vancouver and Whistler. So, I should probably refine my opening question just a little: Are these Winter Olympics, in terms of spectator experience, the best ever?</p>

<p>On Friday I was outside the <a href="http://www.vancouver2010.com/main-media-centre/">Broadcast Centre </a>grabbing some fresh air when I saw a large crowd heading down the street towards me. At the centre of the throng was a big Canadian flag being waved proudly in the air. As the people moved closer I could see that the man carrying that flag was <a href="http://winterolympics.external.bbc.co.uk/athletes/athlete=32692394/index.html">Jon Montgomery</a>, a Canadian <a href="http://winterolympics.external.bbc.co.uk/skeleton/resultsandschedules/event=SNM001000/phase=SNM001104/index.html">gold medallist last weekend in the skeleton</a>.</p>

<p>Around him, an impromptu procession had formed - a celebration of home-grown success. The further down the road that Montgomery went, the more people tagged on behind. If this had been a scene in some other countries maybe there would have been accusations of over-hyped nationalism, but this felt spontaneous, natural and very good natured.<br />
 <br />
I had witnessed just one of hundreds of events that have been taking place on the streets here every day, but for me it summed up one of the successes of these Games.</p>

<p>When I interviewed <a href="http://www.vancouver2010.com/more-2010-information/about-vanoc/organizing-committee/management-team/john-furlong/john-furlong_88274Zn.html">John Furlong</a>, the chief executive of the Vancouver Olympics, last week, he said that he wanted the Games to help unite Canadians. Few would argue that hasn't happened over the past two weeks.</p>

<p>These have not, though, just been a Games for Canadians, they've been an all-embracing Games. The Canadian people could not have been more welcoming. All the athletes I've spoken to have said exactly the same.</p>

<p>Foreigners have been welcomed with open arms. It's almost impossible to travel on public transport here without a local coming over to speak to you (admittedly the BBC accreditation around my neck is a bit of a giveaway) and ask how you're enjoying the Olympics. There's a real pride here in Vancouver, as we saw from the strong response to the original articles which were so critical of the Games.</p>

<p>It's going to be interesting in London in 2012 to see if the British people get behind their Olympic team in quite the same way as the Canadians have here. Flags fly in every shop window, and are displayed on hundreds of thousands of shirts and jackets. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Canadian crowd celebrates women's ice hockey gold" src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/jamespearce/pearce.jpg" width="595" height="335" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></span></p>

<p>My producer, Jon, noticed early in the Olympics that a number of people were wearing red Canadian mittens. He decided that he'd buy a pair to take home for his wife. Two weeks later he's still looking! Every shop has sold out. They've become the must-have fashion accessory of the Games - millions have been bought.</p>

<p>It's just another illustration of how Canadians have united behind their country's flag. Even <a href="http://www.oprah.com/index.html">Oprah Winfrey </a>was excited to be able to give some away on her show the other day. </p>

<p>I can only write about my personal experience in Vancouver, and, as you can see, I have little but praise for the way that this city has handled the Olympics. These are only my second Winter Olympics, so I'm in no position to say that they're the best ever, but in terms of spectator experience they definitely compare favourably with <a href="http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/">Turin</a> four years ago.</p>

<p>And how about this for a compliment from a man who really should know what he's talking about? The IOC president <a href="http://www.olympic.org/en/content/The-IOC/Members/Count-Jacques-ROGGE/">Jacques Rogge told me in an interview (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/vancouver_2010/8540224.stm">which you can watch here</a>) that the people of Vancouver had "embraced the Olympic Games like no other city in the world before".</p>

<p>Many other seasoned Winter Olympic observers are also putting Vancouver right at the top of their list. Are they at the top of yours?</p>

I have friends who have never been on heel free skis who are now hooked on it as a sport.  Given the terrible weather from a snow sports standpoint this has been a wonderful Olympics.

That looks like it was down mainly to the canadians tho, London will be a good games but i doubt if it will match the passion and patriotism of the Canadians. Britain is a different social make up and much more fragmented in many ways than Canada, be it socially, politically etc. Canadian success also helped that spirit obviously and in the summer games the only two countries with that capabilty in terms of medals are the usa and china.</p>

This is dispite having two weeks ago never having seen a hockey match, minus the highlights you might see on TV, and now here I am two weeks later, having payed a small fortune to see the Canada v. Norway Mens game (first game in the qualification round), and then following the Canadian team to their nail biting finish against the USA not two hours ago.  <br>I may be talking simply talked hockey up to this point, but all the other events that I've witnessed (mainly at live screening venues) have had amazing atmospheres, with the Canadians (who truly live up to their friendly reputation) being supportive of all competitors in these wondrous games with the key notable event being sat in a restaurant as Shaun White (Mens half pipe Gold) as he completed his final attempt, and everyone going, what can only be described as, completely insane, post landing the final trick, the rarely landed McTwist. <br>Its not simply the more adventurous sports that the atmosphere has been over the top for either.  Oh no! Every event is brought with as much excitement as the last, although home games do tend to provide just a little bit more.  After all who would expect to see a Mexican wave at a curling match? However yet there I was, at the mens gold medal game, taking part in possibly the most surreal moment of my life so far.<br>In fact its not just the sporting events that bring in an impressive atmosphere, even the the cultural Olympiad events (most of them free) have had an atmosphere to rival most of the sporting events.  I think that this should be a key point for the London 2012 organisers to take note of when they go home as if people cant necessarily make it to the sporting events themselves this will still help them feel part of the festivities.<br><br>The fact is, if London can pull half the atmosphere I have experienced here in my short time out in Vancouver, I personally feel that London and, generally more so, Great Britain will come out with a new lease of life, more unified and patriotic.

Not just in Vancouver and Whistler itself but way outside the area, ironically much helped by the unseasonal spring weather. Literally thousands of us made the trip to Vancouver (a ferry ride of an hour or more for a good many of us) to lap up the atmosphere and without fail went back home wanting more... I cant say whether it was the best; havent been to any of the other winter games. But this was something I will remember the rest of my life. The atmosphere,the crowds, the good natured line-ups everywhere, and the many many people we met, will never meet again but chatted and shared with. Nothing will ever compare to this and it wasnt dependent on our medal haul (although of course that didnt do any harm). Well done VANOC, well done BC.</p>

Notice how Canada's medals increased in pace, that helped too.Not to much emphasis on the old generation or has been stars, more on the young and their future. Look carefully at that. Again it worked. The olympics is about the future whilst remembering the past get that balance right. Even the adverts were much better than normal . Plus we actually watched the adverts  as they were about the olympics and the company brand. Lots of little things went wrong. But hey who cares. Cups always half full in Vancouver.

Regionalism is a huge issue in Canada, and this has been the first time in my life that I've really felt patriotism surge across Canada.

I think that James Pearce has captured much of the key points of the games. I would like to add a couple mnore things. First, one of the key things highlighted by most commentators is the role that volunteers have played in making these games so successful. It is not just the friendly and positive interaction with visitors, but it is what they have done behind the scenes. At Whistler, the volunteer course crew (I was not one of them) have worked on many days from 3:00 a.m to 7:00 p.m. to get the courses in shape for racing. <br><br>Most reporters and bloggers have stayed in Vancouver, the atmosphere and enthusiasm at Whistler is just as great! <br><br>London 2012 has a lot tolearn and a lot to live up to.

Shame though that most of the video clips are only available from the UK.<br>__________<br><br>Yes, the BBC does a good job.  It is a serious broadcaster that takes its public duties and responsibilities to heart.  Consequently it is arguably the best news service on earth. (Hats off to Justin Webb, by the way.)<br><br>----------<br><br>There is a difference between having a reporter and a camera at an event and actually covering an event competently. CTV cannot be counted upon reliably to understand this difference.<br><br>If you think CTV did an adequate job, go back and look at the CBC coverage of previous games, of exactly the same sports.  Huge difference, right?<br><br>CTV cuts corners everywhere, and tries to jam in every last possible commercial, even if that means running the commercial while the sporting event is going on.  It means cutting corners on the number of cameras used to cover hockey.  It means, more or less, only covering events involving Canadians. More precisely, my actual impression is that it means only covering events featuring English-speaking Canadians, and then, if there aren't any English speakers (or hardly any), maybe we'll cover French speakers.  You might not think it's true, but just watch their coverage.  See how often it happens, and how much air-time is devoted to the various sports.<br><br>Consider the determination to run an interview with the women curlers when they had just been crushingly disappointed - instead of showing the men (french speakers) from the short track skating who had just won two gold medals.  They couldn't have waited until the next day to interview the curlers to permit them to regain a bit more composure?  Let them get a good night's sleep, maybe?  Was it necessary, in effect, to torture them on national TV?  What was the point of that?  It seemed like a kind of mean spirited voyeurism.  No class.<br><br>This evening, they were so determined to squeeze in yet another commercial that they missed the start of the entry of the Canadian team into the ceremony.  It's so bad it's laughable.<br><br>The corner cutting shows up all over the place in their production values.  Their programming has a cheap, tinny look and feel, Brian Williams notwithstanding.  There's nothing they can do about it because it reflects the corporate culture and mindset of the broadcaster.  It has been this way for over thirty years.<br><br>CBC Sports is actually more profitable (or, it has been historically).  The CBC puts real effort into doing a good job because it carries the duty of being the national broadcaster.  The leadership of the CBC take the national mandate of the CBC very seriously.  It is embedded in their beliefs, and in their corporate culture.  This goes right back to the days of Matthew Halton reporting from Ortona at Christmas 1943.  If that is your corporate heritage, you're darn right you're going to take the national mandate seriously.<br><br>So the look and feel of CBC programming is completely different.  They don't cut corners.  They do the job properly.  They put a level of care and attention into their work, so it has a polish and a feel of quality that is absent from CTV.  And they have a level of creativity that is truly admirable.  HNIC is a leader and an innovator in sports programming.<br><br>By contrast, CTV has the artistic creativity of a stack of paper towels.  Utterly pedestrian.  The programming is a bare-bones utilitarian peg-board for commercials, nothing more.  Let's see: how little programming we can sandwich between another two dozen commercials?<br><br>When CBC carries hockey, they don't think constantly of milking it for every last possible advertising dollar, while cutting costs to the bone.  No, they think about the importance of the game in our culture and therefore the importance of doing a good job that speaks to what Canadians care about.  And because they produce a good product, they also get much better advertising.<br><br>In microcosym, think about Ron McLean and the HNIC crew.  Now think about the CTV crew for the Hockey today.  There's no comparison, is there? No, not even close.<br><br>That difference runs through the two organizations from top to bottom, and it has done for as long as I can remember.<br><br>... Which is why when Canada's national teams compete, it is important to put the broadcast in the hands of an organization that understands the national mandate.  You are not merely selling cars, beer, soft drinks, hamburgers and banking services.  You are showing Canada's athletes representing their country.  These athletes are our Chariots of Fire.  It is transcendent.  Do it with respect.  Put your duty to your country ahead of yourself and your narrow commercial interests.<br><br>CTV just does not get this.  At all.<br></p>

HNiC used to be excellent but the quality has definitely dropped in recent years, and as bad as Chris Cuthbert was, Bob Cole would have been worse, much worse... too bad Jim Hughson couldn't have been loaned to CTV for the Games... Bob McKenzie on the panel was very good, though, Nick Kypreos not so much...<br><br>whether it's because the CBC is far more experienced covering a major event like the Olympics and it's CTV's first attempt, or the CBC is more 'establishment' while CTV and its cable partners skew to a younger, X-Games type audience, or CTV didn't have the financial resources to do a better job, the end result was disappointing...<br></p>

All sports covered (even, surprisingly, those in which France had no competitors) and generally with knowledgable commentators. The middle few days I was forced to search for fragmented coverage of approximately 4-5 hours per day total, mainly BBC2 between 2300 - 0300. The production and commentary/comments were uniformly excellent (something French TV could benefit from, commentary doesn't exist here, just talking and occasionally referring to the match) but whilst the quality was first rate, the quantity was poor.

At the end of the games, the TV coverage even managed to mix up names and nationalities of 1st and 3rd place of the 50km crosscountry race.

Allot of these Winter Sports are actually Canada's #1 supporter sports. So they are looking forward to the Ice Hockey gold medal finals for 4 years, in the same way a Brit or an Italian would look forward to the Football World Cup final on home soil! Similar with the Ice skating and alpine events.<br><br>In London no matter how hard we try there is NO WAY everyone is going to get as excited about the Olympic Football final that way (Because of no team GB and "star" restrictions) or even the swimming where we have done well recently, just because between Olympics no-one cares! I bet 90% of Brits have no clue what any of our Gold medal winners from Beijing have been doing for the past 2 years! This is not helped by the fact we don't have any bonafide track and field stars anymore! But I GUARANTEE 90% of Canadians will be tuning in week in week out to watch Sydney Cosbey &amp; co in the NHL week in week out.<br><br>It is not apples for apples and you are silly to try to make a comparison.<br><br>Now to your other point regarding the TV viewing. It depends where you are. I live in Hong Kong and they just don't care (Again because they have no-one playing/doing any of the sports here) so it was not on at all, apart from a 5 min flash of ice skating on the news.. However I did spend 10 days down in Australia and the Sport mad Aussies were loving it (regardless of having minimal successful involvement) and had 3 channels dedicated to it. It was brilliant when they won the Halfpipe gold and in fairness they got behind Amy in the Skeleton too.  The random weather and clearly mental icy slopes made the Skiing very un-predictable and exciting.  For me it was the best Olympics I have seen since LA 84 with Daley &amp; Seb. It is a shame those guys or the likes are not around to inspire the nation for 2012.<br><br>London will be good, but far more reserved and low key. I am picturing a big Wimbledon type atmosphere.<br><br>Pimms anyone?<br><br><br></p>

I was living in Vancouver for a year on an international exchange programme at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 2003/4 - that was 7 years ago and not long after Vancouver had gone from 'Candidate City' to receiving the 'Bid'. Already then, you could feel the enthusiasm for the Olympics - people of all ages, races, cultures &amp; degrees of wealth were all united in their support for what was coming to their city. Already then, key decisions were being taken - infrastructure was being laid, with the Sea to Sky Highway from Vancouver to Whistler being re-designed and widened to accomodate the increased volume in traffic - but more than anything it was the feel-good glow to the city with Canadians so proud that they had been chosen to host the Games. This is why it seemed so cruel that their Games got off to the worst possible start with the death of Nodar Kumaritashvili. However, the fact that this was overcome and by the end of 17 days, everyone was discussing these Games as being in the category 'Best Ever' shows that hard work does pay off in life with Vancouver getting exactly the Games that they had strived for and dreamt of all those years ago. <br><br>As someone who rates Vancouver as the nicest city in the world to live in. I only hope the Games haven't changed Vancouver - it was already perfect before. I don't think it will - it might just be that the secret gem of the world is no longer quite so secret. </p>

The coverage was excellent and I would agree with everyone that the atmosphere in the city looked fantastic. <br><br>Conversely I was in Beijing for the 2008 games and was hugely disappointed. Whilst I was fortunate enough to get a ticket to the athletics which was fantastic (the 'birds nest' was even more impressive than it looked on television) the atmosphere outside the Olympic village was none existent. It is no exaggeration to say that you would have had no idea that the worlds biggest sporting event was even happening in the city. The problem stemmed from the fact that the Chinese State do not allow any sort of congregation in public places, there were therefore no big screens or indeed any public events what so ever in the city. The proof that the impression of a 'People's Games' was nothing but a charade culminated with the closing ceremony and the 'largest firework display in history' in Tiananmen Square. No doubt it looked magnificent on television but the sad truth is that nobody was allowed anywhere near the square in reality, and the Chinese people had no choice but to sit and watch it on television, the same as everybody else. It was a tragic waste and in my opinion added weight to the argument that the games should have never been rewarded to a totalitarian state in the first instance.<br><br>I have no doubt that Vancouver could not have been more different, with the local population treating the games as a 2 week long, city wide, open invite, international party, as they should. I do hope that London can follow their fine example, and learn the lessons from Beijing.<br></p>

However, the comments from the UK olympic organisers about learning more from Vancouver than Beijing exhibit if not blind prejudice, then certainly a lack of understanding about the differences between east and western cultures, especially acute from a british perspective given Canadians still bow the Queen. The aims of the two games were also very different. Beijing was about showing the west and world they were able to put on a modern games, and , where possible, accomodate the media scrutiny that would be trained on them unlike any games since Moscow. Canada was never under that type of pressure. If China had allowed the tide of nationalism to wash over the games in a similar way, they would have been crucified by the international media, so in that sense it is even more unfair to make comparisons.<br><br>Can London learn much from Vancouver? Well perhaps making sure that all the areas are safe for the athletes in advance would be good idea. Keeping the red tops newspapers on a short leash, as suggested above, would be a commendable, if unlikely succeed goal. London has to match to Vancouver interms of spectator access and atmosphere, but given that the international spotlight won't shine as bright on London as Beijing, the prospects are good that London will been seen by the Western-philes at the IOC, BBC and US TV networks, the most important people to impress. If that is, they manage to avoid a Munich esc farce. </p>

I didn't see Amy Williams's moment of glory live, otherwise I'd have possibly had that somewhere, but that didn't seem as special because it was only us who really embraced it. All of Canada's moments were met with such genuine joy by the nation that it made each of them spectacular in their own right.</p>

What I can say is that the Canadian winter olympics have been excellent abd the Canadians, competitors, organisers and those at the 'coal face' should be feeling very proud today about the exceptional achievments. Unquestionably, the wonderful atmosphere was in part due to the Canadian's relentless quest for medals (and achieved a record 14 golds) but the specatators never forgot those with little spectator support, urging them on to the finish line.<br>So, I think these games were special, because the Canadian people are special and it was that that really set the scene for a wonderful tournament. Their sportsmen and women were not passive, they fought hard for everything they won and they won a lot.<br>Today Canada, wake up and be proud of your achievments on the track and the planning, building and infrastructure put in place for the games to take place. I salute you, most sincerely.<br>Finally, the BBC coverage was generally excellent as you would expect. But, there needs to be 'sould searching' into which professional anchorment/women went to cover the Games and which sports personalities/professional sportsmen/women also went It was the latter category that let you down badly and made you look unprofessional and amateur. Do not assume that a medal winner in a track or rowing event, is going to be able to commentate on games 'on ice'. It doesn't work unless they are really clued up on the sport being covered. The solution for me was to watch  some games with the sound turned off. This is nothing to do with Canada, although it is very much part of the enjoyment of the Winter games experience and is everything to do with the BBC. </p>

If my tax payers money can be spent on making one persons dream come true then that isn't a waste of my money.<br>And in return that person gives back to the community. The amount of work that athletes like Kelly Holmes and Steve Redgrave do with schools, working at grassroots level is inspirational. So we paid for their dreams to come true, and in return they are feeding back to the community, a fantastic use of my money.<br>So come on UK, get behind these games, support them, go see them, enter the atmosphere, it will be a once in a lifetime opportunity to see our athletes competing for our country to make their dreams come true in front of their home crowd. </p>

The women's had similar levels of skill but was played at a slower pace and why take out the best part of ice hockey in body-checking?! If we're honest, everyone loves the big hits and the fights that sometimes result and these are totally absent from the women's game. It takes away from the sport. The rest of the Games, I watched 10 minutes of a handful of events then got bored, so there is no way I could class this as 'the best'.</p>

Brilliant spectacle which combined the modern sports, with the traditional events and it didn't feel disjointed at all. I'm sad it's over and just hope it's a similar experience in 4 years time.

Despite hours of lost sleep following these games, I cannot see any group of people (athletes or spectators) who have laid out a specific complaint.  Even the lugers, who may have cause to complain, seem to be defending their difficult track.  There aren't even the usual doping controversies (so far).  The only concrete problems are nit-picky (e.g., a column that didn't rise, a fence that had to be built around the cauldron) and pale in comparision to the important facets of the games (e.g., the athlete and spectator experience).  So, unless the grumps out there can substantiate the vague claims they make, they should keep quiet and let the rest of us get on with enjoying the achievement.    <br><br>Great red button coverage BBC!

Rather the CTV celebrated the occasion and congratulated athletes on their particpation and efforts like fans. It was very refereshing to see. The only thing CBC does better is Ron McLean on the best broadcasters anywhere - a true professional. Any time the boring and patronising Brian Williams came on I switched to NBC.</p>

Rhona Martin and Wilf Riley were very good.  The Biathlon and Cross Country were poor.

If not then get in outside commentators from other networks.<br><br>As for the audiences there.  It seems like most if not all of the arenas inside and out were full.  This is possibly because of two things.  Winter sports are very well attended even if they are minority sports in most countries and secondly I think most of the ticket allocation went to the public and not the corporate giants that paid to advertise with the IOC.<br><br>Hopefully London will learn from this and if corporate sponsors haven't taken their seats at the start of any competition then they should let the general public in at a discounted price so at least you won't see empty seats and there will be people cheering.</p>

Vancouver might try and claim to be the best WINTER Games ever, but the comparison to the far more global Summer Games just does not stack up. As a seasoned spectator of both types of games, I think the Jacques Rogge himself rightly declared the Lillehammer games to be the "best Games ever".<br>On the merits of the Vancouver Games, I am somewhat unimpressed for the following main reasons:<br>- In a number of races, there was a lack of knowledge in the editorial crew about what makes for good TV angles/shots: we got lots of pictures of the leader, without many shots showing how the contestant/pack behind were doing (closing in, catching up?). As a result, the TV feed did not convey the sense of race and competition. This was particularly dire during the end of (skating, skiing) events when excitement is the distance between competitors as they sprint for the line, not some stylised close-up of their technique. I do not need to mention what happened if one competitor was Canadian!<br>- A lot of the graphics, points and computerised elements of the coverage were just plain broken: sometimes the ski-jumping scores shown were wrong, and names and times were mixed up in the displays. And for those who would say that this got rectified quickly, just refer back to the medal ceremony for the 50K skiing, were the winner's name got mixed up - on the last night during the Closing ceremony.<br>- I heard a sound horn from the (Canadian) audience during the Curling finals aimed at distracting the (Norwegian) opposition. To be fair, this was itself greeted with booing from other parts of the crowd, to show their displeasure. But a sense remains that the partisan crowd did not cheer every nation as your article claims, but that it was for Canada to "own the podium" (what a daft phrase), at all cost.<br>I bet people who were in Vancouver had a great time, but if you were not there for Ice Hockey or merely to try and beat the US-Americans, I am not sure you would have been invited to the afterparty. As for the TV coverage, Vancouver did not own the podium, they were not in Gold contention, finishing even after Salt Lake City, never mind Lillehammer.</p>

I think my favourite game they played was against Russia because it showed how they could work together as a team though in the US game we saw how much both teams wanted to win. I was with 30 Canadian students in Leicester, watching that game on a make-shift screen (a white sheet on a wall and a projector attached to a laptop with BBC covering the event), drinking beer, at times covering our eyes in fear, other times jumping for joy. I was so happy when we won and we started to sing O Canada, while hugging each other with joy. Anyone who claims no one cares that we won the gold is out of their mind - all the nations who competed, all Canadians, and I think some Brits too, all were tied in this tournament.<br><br>I am also so proud how all Canadians supported our athletes as well as supported other nations - that's whats truly great of having sporting venues in Canada and other multi-cultural hubs; in downhill skiing you will see Swiss flags and hear bells cheering on Defago; in snowboarding I sure many Americans, Canadians and other nationalities were cheering on Shaun White to perform the McTwist; in Hockey, yes we may have had the majority but I did see some Swedish flags or Russian fans here and there throughout the crowds!<br><br>As for were these the 'best games ever': I think we wisely should not forget what happened at the beginning of the games - the death of an athlete should never be taken lightly. I think VANOC did a proper job in regards to that unforturnate incident.<br><br>The technical glitches, like one of the torches not rising, well those things happen but don't really take away from the actual attraction - the sporting events, which were wonderful to watch. Good job to BBC for the coverage...I was annoyed sometimes when a hockey game wasn't shown but I understand you can't feature everything. Also maybe work on your announcing skills - sometimes the hockey commentary was downright confusing or out of place. <br><br>Having watched Lillehammer, Nagano, Salt Lake, and Turin, I don't think anything can measure to the spirit and festival atmosphere that Vancouver's Canadians, and other visitors, brought to these olympics. (Although, I don't know if VANOC should get credit for that - probably more on account of Canadians wanting to show our patriotism to the world)<br><br>I'm fairly confident that without the fans, the spontaneous O Canada's, and the welcome the residents of Vancouver gave to the international athletes we probably wouldn't be seeing 'best games ever' in a title.<br><br>However, I think we did see something special in Vancouver, and with that we can say it was a success and we showed something special to the world!<br><br>Cheers to Canada but also congrats to the rest of the athletes!!!! <br><br></p>

Personally I think that the BBC spent too much on the coverage as I believe the average sports fan in this country (myself included) probably only watched up to three or four percent of the coverage made available. <br>In response to a comment made earlier about the 'BBC making viewers feel like children because of constant explanations', I think this is a ridiculous comment because it's common knowledge that the vast majority of Britons have no idea as to the rules of the majority of the sports which were portrayed in the games. Only a select few would be able to understand what was going on without the explanations of rules and procedures, so I must praise the BBC for treating the viewers as though they don't know what is going on, because in all honesty, most people didn't know what was going on in most events. Note that I say 'most' and that of course there are people that understand perfectly the rules of the individual events perfectly well, just not many people do!<br><br>Moving ahead to the London games in 2012. I know that these games will be a huge success. The UK is a sport loving nation and I can already predict that every event will be sold out well in advance, even preliminary stages of 'mediocre' events such as the table tennis or the archery. I only hope that these games can bring the entire country together and that the organisers can help showcase not only London to the world, but instead the entire country of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Personally I am very proud of London being selected for the games, but I think it would have been better for the country if somewhere such as Liverpool or Manchester or Newcastle or Edinburgh could have been chosen, just so that the world could learn that there are people in this country that don't actually live in London.<br>I've seen several comments relating to the UK having too much of a social mix to have the same level as pride and patriotism that Canada has shown during these winter olympics. In response to this, may I remind people that the UK is actually less ethnically diverse than Canada and that only 48% of residents in Vancouver consider the English language as their native language. If Canada can be patriotic, I sure believe that Britain can match or better it, and I can almost feel the nationwide parties up and down the country kicking off. <br>Roll on the long summer holiday of 2012, I can't wait. And I'll sure be making the 5 hour trip (short trip in Canadian terms) to London to be a part of it!<br><br>Harry, near Northallerton, North Yorkshire, England.</p>

Yesterday morning we queued for 3 hours from 8am to get into our local sports bar. The place was a heaving mass of red and white - the same scene all over the country - for Canada's Word Cup Final, Ashes Final Test, Wimbledon Mens final, Six Nations decider etc all rolled into one. Hockey is THE religion of Canada and the gold medal game was just spectacular! You couldn't write a better script, with the greatest talent of his generation (and who knows if he'll be the greatest ever) Sidney Crosby scoring the winner in overtime. The only thing that could ever top that would be Wayne Rooney scoring the winner in South Africa against Germany in the 93rd minute. <br><br>As the sweaters, T shirts and hats have said for months over here "BELIEVE". Everyone wants to be seen in national colours and it's not partial, racist or uncool to wear the flag and show your love of all things Canadian. <br><br>If London can capture any of this euphoria and bottle it, the Games will be great. How they get the whole nation to buy into it like Canada, I don't know. You could start by copying Molson, the big brewery near Toronto airport, which flies a flag the size of a football pitch loud and proud to welcome anyone to the frozen North. You can't miss it. If Tesco or Asda did the same, some Jobsworth would descend and tell them to take it down because it's antagonistic. For two weeks, consign these idiots to the Isle of Wight and get on with doing what Britain does best - pomp, circumstance and pride!</p>

We'll get that damn snow somewhere even if it fancies to melt down. We simply won't allow it to melt! By combined nation's address to the skies :o)))) After all snow clouds and rain clouds can always be diverted away by the planes, so that the skies stay clean without down-pour during skiers' competition. And shooting. <br>That the coverage is detailed and synchronised and clearly labelled, the running grades, when the skiiers run. <br><br>I mean, organisers' worries are different to a particpant's worries. In that case you don't care so much to win yourself but that others say they were comfy and had all conditions to win. <br><br>Personally, I was very happy during the opening ceremony, and also badly wanted those Canadian mittens (and American knitted hats with some deer embroidered :o)))), and very much liked the man who sang the Olympic hymn at the closing ceremony, and the whales swimming in the opening ceremony, extraordinary well done work of light images, stunning. <br><br>I think if Sochi manages something close in terms of being viewable, and good broadcast throughout, and, most importanly, ship-shape conditions for athelets to compete, we'll be alright. <br><br>Thank you, Vancouver, you have tried hard, all have noticed how focused the Canadians were on the event.<br></p>

Everyone shattered this morning after the overtime victory in men's hockey against the US.  It was like a movie script, unreal but superb!  I have lived in Canada for years (born on Merseyside)-- and as I was picking up some wine to take to friends for the 3 pm game, I said "Liverpool playing today and Canada this afternoon, talk about stress city!" - and he said it will be close but we will see a great game of hockey and Sidney Crosby will score the winning goal."   I went home and Torres was playing again for Liverpool and they won.  The "beautiful game" and "it's Canada's game" for hockey--what a great day!   Shall now put on my red maple leaf mittens and take the dog for a walk in the sunshine, ice melting....and looking forward to London's moment in the sun.  KNOW it will be a success if they let the crowds/fans be part of the scene.   Thanks again for your great article.<br></p>

There was far too much commentary by Claire Balding and her team leaving us praying for some action. The area in which they were standing had a lot of distracting background noise, was uninspiring and often grey and wet.  Even the presenters looked fed up at times.  An indoor commentary box would have been far better.  The coverage of a Winter Olympics should be about inspiring vistas and snow, not a grey wet noisy outdoor area. Next time BBC more action less talk.</p>

The myth is that Canada cheated by not allowing practice time for other countries?  Actually, countries are allocated adequate training runs under Olympic rules.  Hosting the Olympics is difficult for any country and London may be hard pressed to do as well.</p>

I don't know what the international media has been feeding you, but this program is simply a funding excercise to better prepare athletes, not only for the Vancouver Olympics, but also for the future.  You see, we have a grand tradition of under-funding our athletes to the point of embarrassment.  And this was our first step at fixing this.<br><br>And as for limiting access to venues and tracks... from everything I've read, this is absolutely false.  In fact, from what I understand, Canada has met the IOC requirement and in some cases offered more track time than previous Winter Olympics.  I believe I heard one athlete mention limited time on the track.  One.  Now if someone has a specific source they would like to share, I would be more than willing to listen.<br><br>Ahem, last but not least.

The added discipline of skicross was excellent as well. Of course it was tragic that the Georgian died but unfortunately this can happen in winter sports (much more so than any of the Summer sports that I can think of). Those of you who follow the alpine speed disciplines understand that people get seriously inured (paralysed) and occasionally die doing it (at least a couple women in the last 15 years or so have been killed racing). The one negative thing with this death was that it wasn't a particularly bad crash but unfortunate in where it happened and what he hit. Anyway, from a sporting point of view the Olympics were great.<br><br>BTW, NBC coverage here in the States is pretty bad....excellent if you like hockey and curling as these were shown a lot on CNBC and MSNBC but all the other sports the coverage was bad and very little was live (not even the closing ceremony which I only found out after reading everything that Rogge had said on the BBC website before he had said it on the TV here!!). The evening coverage consisted of 75% adverts....e.g. show Miller go down, 3-5 min commercial break, then Cuche, 3-5 min commercial break,etc,and would only show about 10 runs of which 5 were only shown cos of the big crashes they had. Unbelievable, and this was the same for most things (exception was ice skating where they showed all the top contenders i.e. about 10 skaters). No red button over here. I miss the BBC!!! <br><br></p>

It was a focused effort to win, with heavy investment, clear targets (30 medals overall, nearly achieved) - at that, mind it, Canada put a world record in medals, getting 14 Gold in winter games. Previous best were 13 Gold (Russia, Insbruk, 1976) and then 13 Gold (Salt-Lake-City 2002 Norway).<br><br>Though of course, you can't compare directly as the amount of winter sport disciplines grows year to year in the world, in Insbruk there were only 37 Golden medals all in all, in Salt-Lake already 80, in Vancouver there were 86 Gold medals. <br><br>Anyway, a good, transparent, financial programme, for all to see where investment goes, made publicly available to all, no wonder whole Canada knew where they are going and towards what aim they are working, as a nation. <br><br>In total, money, investment into Canadian athelets preparation for Vancouver was 5 times higher than with the same Canadian athelets' preparation for Tourine. Financed, as Russian media told me, by state money and by private investors 50/50.<br><br>(I wish we could get our oligarchs involved :o))) into our sportsmen traing, but that's un-realistic, to get so patriotic oligarchs suddenly, alas.)<br><br>Here it is, by kind of sport, for Canada. Some investments didn't pay off, but overall, with 14 Gold and 27 total, - one clearly sees the Own the Podium Programme has worked. <br><br>Figure-skating   investment was 825,000 to prepare skaters for Tourine,  2,740,500 for Vancouver (Canadian dollars).

In fact, for no HD users the red button offered one channel only, often dedicated to hours after hours of curling. To make matter worse, BBC2 often showed the same event like the red button no HD channel, limiting the choice further or, better said, preventing any choice. Also, for the same reasons (I think) there were events that were shown as live, while they were actually about to finish, the results were on the online newspapers and the Olympics official web site, but they were presented by the BBC in a way that looked like live, which I found misleading (ex: the 27 February men second run slalom on BBC2 – but this is not the only case). I understand that the BBC was testing HD Freeview for terrestrial broadcast, but the Freeview terrestrial box was not available yet on the market. Was there any other way to test, avoiding limiting the access to such an important event that take place only every four years?</p>

Our athletes performed brilliantly in Vancouver and got people back home excited about winter sports as never before. If we can get half as excited about the events as the Canadians did for hockey and curling, I think we'll be set. I hope we can learn from Vancouver how to embrace the games and throw a fun party for the world, while also learning from their sometimes tragic mistakes.</p>

It's because it's not boastful or to the degradation of others. It's simply looking for a genuine reason to celebrate, and taking it when it's presented to us. I think that has contributed to the feeling of Vancouver's Winter Olympic games being such a positive one. I definitely enjoyed this Olympics, and know many people who have shared in that happiness. Simply being Canadian, as a whole, is what made this Olympics so successful.</p>

In a suburb of Vancouver to be exact. I have never seen Canadians so singly unified as I have seen them over the last 2 weeks. I hope it doesn't revert back to how it was. It has been awesome.<br><br>Last Monday I took a day off work and went to downtown Vancouver with my wife and four kids (the oldest is 8). We had an awesome time mingling with people from all nations in spite of the line ups and huge crowds. After over 8 hours we headed home with calls from the kids to do it again - which we did. The atmosphere was electric and everyone I saw was having fun with it.<br><br>The volunteers were amazing throughout but I have greatest admiration for the police. The way police from across the nation came together to work at the Olympics showed how unified Canada was. I was at the Czech Republic Vs Slovakia men's hockey game and saw countless fans posing with the Montreal police officer who was working there. On leaving, I saw police from outside of Vancouver pointing tourists towards the Live City party sites and transit stations with a smile and a wave. These gentlemen (and no few ladies) were working long hours and seemed to be loving the experience.<br><br>The "Own the Podium" initiative seems to have backfired. Yes, Canada won a lot of gold medals but the worldwide (read British) media seems to be offended by it. Most Canadians know the name of "Own the Podium" and know that it injected some much-needed cash into Canadian athletics programs but do not see it as others do. It wasn't seen as a way to cheat other countries out of medals, but rather seen as investing in the role models of Canadian kids to promote various events. I see it as a way to improve the sport participation levels across the country. My 6 year old now skates with one hand behind his back because that is how he saw speed skaters doing it...<br><br>The BBC TV coverage that has been blasted as too Canadian should be shown for what it is. It wasn't Canadian crews working on most of the TV cameras, but an IOC company that produces all TV coverage for all Olympics. The flavour shots are produced by local TV Networks (I believe the BBC piggybacked on NBC's coverage) but the majority of coverage was provided by the Spanish company that IOC employs. As a point for London 2012 to ponder on, in Canada coverage was provided by CTV, TSN and Sportsnet. TSN and Sportsnet are direct competitors who usually try to outdo each other (think ITV and BBC). They combined forces to provide excellent coverage for Canadians who wanted to watch various different events.<br><br>A final note. I would trade in all of Canada's Gold medals for the ability to keep the newfound National spirit and identity alive. For too long Canadians have seen themselves as being smaller than their southern cousins or colonist brothers. No longer. I would trade in all of Canada's medals if it would bring Nodar Kumaritashvili back.</p>

The organisers and volunteers did an amazing job with what they had; did you hear the athletes complaining? Of course not, they train year round and are use to changing weather and less than perfect snow conditions.<br>I took the shuttle bus transport from North Vancouver to Whistler –twice – to see skiing events. On both occasions the whole experience was perfect. 90 minute coach ride along one of the most stunning roads in the world, welcomed and directed by pleasant smiling volunteers to the security section which passed  quicker than any airport and was far more friendly.  Each event was full of all nationalities enjoying the occasions each cheering on not only their own but all nations. <br>My local rowing club in Stanley Park rented out the upper floor to the German province of Saxony; it was a party from day one, they estimated selling 300 barrels of their beer ... the count yesterday was over 1000! <br>And as for the end of it all, honestly you couldn’t have written it better.

At least not the democracy of our government. We’re giving him six months to cool off and think things over, then we’ll consider towing him back to shore.”<br><br>But the satirist insists he was only doing what came naturally after years of watching Monty Python on TV and blames the American Public Broadcasting Service for his predicament.<br><br>“They’re the ones that kept showing those Monty Python Marathons,” he said. “Hour after hour of Cleese and the boys – something had to give. Obviously it caused my normally docile Canadian DNA to mutate and I seem to have developed an informed opinion – something this government won’t tolerate.”<br><br>Meanwhile, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association has filed a lawsuit to have Jimmy’s sentence quashed, calling it “cruel and unusual punishment.” According to CCLA spokesperson Obi Kanobi, “Mr. Cockroach will miss the Gold Medal Hockey game, and to a Canadian, that’s like … well, it’s really bad, and we want him off that ice flow immediately.”<br><br>But the government official insists that’s not going to happen. “The best we can offer is a transfer to the new Arctic prison facility we’re building at GwanTaw Neemow Bay near Inuvik,” said the official. “We’ll give him a cell beside Richard Colvin and the other rats on our list.” <br><br>Until the case is resolved, a federal judge has rejected a government request for an injunction and is allowing the website for Jimmy The Cockroach to remain online at IOCsong.com. <br><br><br>(*WARNING: Jimmy’s reports are pure satire and may not be suitable for all levels of intelligence.)<br></p>

The truth is that it's very difficult to compare different Games. Each one has its own charms.

The truth is that there's really no need to worry if these were the best Games ever or not. What matters is that everybody appears to have enjoyed them, and for that Vancouver deserves our congratulations.<br>I would also like to make one other point. A number of you mention the volunteers. It was very remiss of me not to do the same. They have been some of the stars of these Olympics. It makes so much difference to the spectator experience when the volunteers are so knowledgeable and so helpful. Jacques Rogge was right to single them out for special praise at the closing ceremony.<br>I head home to the UK later today, but first let me thank Vancouver for some memories which will last a lifetime, and also to thank all of you for contributing so much to these pages while I've been here.</p>

This is simply not supported by facts.  <br>Vancouver's venues were completed years in advance and have been available to all the world's athletes.  One of the reasons often cited by the American athletes as to their great success in Vancouver was their familiarity with the tracks/courses etc. because they had so much access to train on them.  <br>Most Olympics barely get their venues finished in the Olympic year so no one has much access; in Vancouver, many were available 3 years in advance and none were less than 2 years.  Vancouver even hosted some world cup/international events in the preceding two years.  <br>None of this adds up to a limiting of access.<br>Furthermore, the Own the Podium effort, though poorly named, is more an effort to properly support our athletes to the level of other competitive nations rather than an aggressive exclusionary plan.  Canada has, in past Olympics, been embarrassed that our athletes were great and tried their hearts out but often fell short due to a lack of time for training because they had to work, a lack of access to physiotherapy, sports psychology, top notch coaching, top notch equipment and science. In fact, may of our Olympic athletes lived below the poverty line due to the career/job sacrifices they were willing to make to train and compete. Canada felt that since we put such high expectations on them, we should give them the means to compete well and live decently at the same time.  It was gratifying that the taxpayer's (including me)money was well spent.  Many Canadian athletes credited the extra funding as being critical to finding that extra edge, that hundredth of a second, that confidence to win...<br></p>

But yesterday, after the hockey game, I put a Canadian flag on my front door.  And most of my neighbours had done the same.  There has been a sea change among the people of this country.  And I don't think anything is being done in a mean or spiteful way; it's just that we have never really dug into ourselves to take any pride, and never had this type of success in the Olympics.  We have always been somebody's colonial leftovers,  or simply ignored, despite trying to do the right thing.  At last we can just be happy to be ourselves.  Together.  </p>

CTV has been a superior broadcasting network, they have 4 channels that has made it possible to watch nearly every event. CBC just can't compare. And the best part is its financing isn't coming out of the tax payer's wallet as it would be with CBC. This was also the first Olympics broadcast in hi-def which made a big difference for me. As for the CTV reporters, well I wasn't too impressed but I'm glad Brian Williams was brought in.<br><br>Another important point to make, this is the first Olympics since 9-11 that I haven't seen any shots of guards walking around with semi-automatic weapons.

The sheer physical presence of that torch being carried through cities, towns, villages and hamlets -- and along the roadways, highways, waterways and skyways between them -- created a tremendous sense of connection across Canada, and not just to the Olympics. <br>     2) Continuing to give out a Terry Fox Award to the athlete or athletes who best embody the spirit of overcoming enormous obstables towards their goals.  Terry Fox lost a leg to cancer and in 1980 decided to run a `Marathon of Hope' across Canada to raise funds for cancer research.  He died before he could finish, but annual Terry Fox Runs held in countries around the world since then have so far raised an astonishing $500 million for cancer research.<br>     There was only going to be one Terry Fox Award but two courageous bronze medal winners required a change of plan.  <br>     Slovenian cross-country skiier Petra Majda was a favourite in her event until an accident during training broke five of her ribs and punctured a lung.  She nonetheless fought through her agony because she knew her countrymen were counting on her.<br>     Canadian figure skater Joannie Rochette's mother died suddenly just days before her short and long programs.  She nonetheless fought through her grief in tribute to her mother's long years of support.<br>     What heroines!

When I first heard about the bid for the Olympics, I was horrified, along with my parents and brother.  We all thought of Montreal and the money that was lost there.  In the weeks leading up to the start of the games, I wasn't so much excited about the games as worried about Vancouver's reputation.  But then, I started paying attention to the torch relay and was moved to tears by a slide show of the race on a Boston newspaper site (can't remember which one).  I was touched to see how many ordinary Canadians participated in the race (whether by being a torch bearer or by watching from the sidelines) and how excited and proud they all seemed to be.  Then the games began and I started hearing about the enthusiasm of the local population and I just couldn't get over the sincere enjoyment apparent on everybody's faces.  This is what got to me about these games.  More so than the Canadian athletes' performances or the fact that Vancouver was hosting a world class event.  It's just been really lovely to see so many people lining the streets of my hometown looking so darn happy and feeling, I think, a sense of community.   </p>

The death of Nodar Kumatashvili was acknowledged by the IOC, VANOC, athletes and spectators in Vancouver and [the rest of the world]. They didn't downplay the tragedy but set up a memorial in Whistler village to remember him. It was very unfortunate this tragedy happened. However, it brought out the best of human natures in dealing with this tragedy at the Games. One of Nodar's team mates competed in the Games in his honour. The Organizers had dealt with this tragedy as humanely as possible. The IOC will pay to build a luge track in honour of Nodar in his hometown. Nodar Kumatashvili's name will live on in the spirits of Olympics, in Whistler village, his hometown, the athletes and the rest of us. He will not be forgotten for generations of Olympics to come. I agee with #182 that through tragedy, mechanical failure at the opening and mother nature, the Vancouver Games had overcome all the worst possible adversities to emerge brilliantly as the best ever Olympic that remains in our hearts. If it didn't, this blog would not have generated so many comments from so many people around the world. </p>

I hope you enjoyed the games at every second like I did. If you were like me, you were hanging on the edge at every event nervous and excited for the athlete to perform. I.E. Watching Bob-sleigh and all the crashes or the Slovenian Skier who received bronze after having broken ribs and a punctured lung or Joannie Rochette and her powerful first and last skate after the sudden death of her mother.<br><br>To All The Complainers:<br>1. This was CTV's first time covering the Olympics. Shaky at times, yes I agree, but I much prefer watching hockey without the presence of Don Cherry. If you remember Turin at all, how he bashed the Canadian Women's hockey team and shamed them for scoring so many goals in a tournament where goals matter.<br><br>2. Were the games the "best-ever"? Who can really answer that? I am a 12 hour drive away from Vancouver in another province and I felt the atmosphere at every single moment of the games. I had many friends travel to Vancouver just to be in Vancouver and felt that nothing could match the party they experienced. Why you are comparing the Vancouver games to other games is just stupid. There will always be error's or glitches, it is inevitable. <br><br>3. As for the death of the young Georgian. It was a major tragedy, but the games are to go on despite adversity. The track was engineered to be incredibly fast, however, we must realize in a sport like Luge accidents occur because of human error. I'm not saying in anyway that it was because the track wasn't safe enough or it was his fault. Athletes will explain to you that Luge has a high accident rate because it relies on split-second decisions. I don't know how good you are when it comes to a quick decision, but I know I can't react that fast and I am a higher end athlete. I also have friends that compete in Street Luge and that is just as dangerous. It was both an awful and a good way to start off the Olympics. It reminded everyone that accidents happen, but it also brought many people, regardless of country, language, religion, race, together.</p>

Hard to say. Rogge has made it clear he won't do what Samaranch did: pronounce with his personal opinion as if he spoke for the IOC (and entire Olympic Movement). These were great Games though, clearly. As a volunteer I know how hard Vanoc worked to scrub and scrub at the blocks of sponsor and Olympic family tickets, in order to give more access and leave fewer empty seats in the venues. They also made most events affordable when compared to a local hockey game. I got to see 3 short track medals awarded (2 gold for Canada, w00t!) for $55 a ticket!  I also spent 2 years' movie budget for a seat at the men's gold medal game. And TOTALLY worth it. :)<br><br>I had 10 relatives from the States visiting: they even attended the first CAN-USA men's hockey game, which the USA won. They were impressed by the energy everywhere, how clean and organized things were, how efficient transportation was...and what good sports Canadians are, even when we lose. After multiple congratulations from Canadian fans after the game, my brother said "if we were in Salt Lake and the tables were turned, I don't think we would've been as gracious."  <br><br>If not then, perhaps now.  I think we managed to stay mostly within the realm of "supporting our team, excited for everyone."  We loved having you all--and we're never gonna do it again!!!!!!!<br><br>In 1964 luge made its Olympic début and a slider died--on a track considered slow by today's standards. The Whistler Sliding Centre was vetted at every stage of development (proposal, design, construction, testing, full operation) by two international sport federations. There were no more sliding mishaps here than at the last world championships--less in bobsleigh, in fact. The sad, stark reality is a 44th ranked slider shouldn't be going "for a track record" (his last words), ever. I think FIL needs to consider how it managed its development programme going forward.  </p>
