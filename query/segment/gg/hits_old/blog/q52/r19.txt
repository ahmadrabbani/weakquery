 stroms en suisse: Winter Olympics

      skip to main  |  skip to sidebar    17.2.10   Winter Olympics     Need a break from speed and spandex? Above is a really beautiful and fun video of the Olympic Winter Games (1924 - 1968).  I especially love the old black and white footage of the earliest games. The winter games had their beginning just down the road in Chamonix, France in 1924, and the Alps have hosted many of the subsequent Olympics. The video contains footage of these Olympic locations:  1924 - Chamonix, France 1928 - St. Moritz, Switzerland  1932 - Lake Placid, New York USA  1936 - Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany  1948 - St. Moritz, Switzerland  1952 - Oslo, Norway  1956 - Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy  1960 - Squaw Valley, California USA  1964 - Innsbruck, Austria  1968 - Grenoble, France Some extra Chamonix skating moments. In this video, Sonja Henie is only 11 years old and the first Olympic figure skater to compete in a short skirt (it's okay, she was young enough that it wasn't improper).
