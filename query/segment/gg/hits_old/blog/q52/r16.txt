The proposal is for skiing and snowboarding at Queenstown and Wanaka skifields, curling at Naseby and short course speed and figure skating in Dunedin. The Edgar plan reportedly has attracted a $500,000 pledge from Major Events NZ, a government body that funds events bringing “significant benefits” to the country. According to the website two of New Zealand’s top snow sport athletes are endorsing the bid. New Zealand free-ski team member Amy Sheehan and Kiwi cross-country skier Nat Anglem gave the Winter Games proposal a thumbs-up at a presentation last week.
