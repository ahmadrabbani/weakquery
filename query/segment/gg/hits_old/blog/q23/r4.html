<H1>Evidence of Ancient Martian Life in Meteorite ALH84001?</H1>

A group of scientists led by David McKay of NASA's 
Johnson Space Center published an article in 
the 16 August 1996 issue of 
<i>Science</i> 
magazine announcing 
the discovery of evidence for primitive bacterial 
life on Mars.  An examination of a meteorite found 
in Antarctica and believed to be from Mars shows:
1) hydrocarbons which are the same as breakdown 
products of dead micro-organisms on Earth, 
2) mineral phases consistent with by-products 
of bacterial activity, and 3) tiny carbonate 
globules which may be microfossils of the primitive 
bacteria, all within a few hundred-thousandths of 
an inch of each other.  Based on age dating of the 
meteorite, the following scenario has been proposed:
<ol>
<li> The original igneous rock solidified within Mars 
about 4.5 billion years ago, about 100 million years 
after the formation of the planet. (Based on isotope 
ages of the igneous component of the meteorite)
<p>
<li> Between 3.6 and 4 billion years ago the rock 
was fractured, presumably by meteorite impacts.  
Water then permeated the cracks, depositing 
carbonate minerals and allowing primitive bacteria 
to live in the fractures.
<p>
<li> About 3.6 billion years ago, the bacteria and 
their by-products became fossilized in the fractures.
(Based on isotope ages of the minerals in the fractures)
<p>
<li> 16 million years ago, a large meteorite struck 
Mars, dislodging a large chunk of this rock and 
ejecting it into space.  (Based on the cosmic ray 
exposure age of the meteorite)
<p>
<li> 13,000 years ago, the meteorite landed in Antarctica.
<p>
<li> The meteorite, ALH84001, was discovered in 1984 in 
the Allan Hills region of Antarctica.

<H3>How do we know the meteorite came from Mars?</H3>

Meteorite ALH84001 is a softball-sized igneous rock 
weighing 1.9 kilograms (4.2 pounds).  It is one of twelve 
meteorites discovered on Earth which are thought to be 
from Mars.  Most meteorites formed early in the history 
of the solar system, some 4.6 billion years ago.  Eleven 
of the twelve martian meteorites have ages less than 
1.3 billion years, ALH84001 at 4.5 billion years old 
being the only exception.  All twelve are igneous rocks 
crystallized from molten magma in a way which suggests 
they formed in a planetary-sized body, not an asteroid.  
They have similar oxygen isotope characteristics to each 
other and higher concentrations of ferric iron, water, 
and other volatiles than other meteorites.  All twelve 
also show evidence of shock heating, presumably as a 
result of the impact which ejected them into space.  
Gas bubbles trapped in one meteorite, EETA79001, have a 
composition which matches the current martian atmosphere 
as measured by the Viking Landers, compelling evidence 
that this meteorite and by association the others, 
including ALH84001, came from Mars.
<p>
<H3>The evidence for life</H3>

The indication of life hinges on three important 
pieces of evidence, all discovered within mineralized 
fractures in the meteorite in close proximity to each 
other.  One is the discovery of abundant polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on the fracture surfaces.  
These are a family of complex organic molecules which 
are commonly found on dust grains and certain types of 
meteorites in outer space, presumably formed by 
non-biological chemical reactions.  However, when 
micro-organisms die they break down into PAHs as well.  
The mixture of PAHs found on ALH84001 is very different 
from that found on dust grains and other meteorites, 
suggesting the possibility of a biological origin.  
Thousands of different types of PAHs are found all 
over the Earth, but those in ALH84001 do not appear 
to be contaminants which have leaked into the meteorite.
<p>
Another line of evidence involves unusual mineral phases 
found beside the PAHs.  These carbonate minerals form 
"globules" about 50 micrometers across, some of which 
have cores containing manganese and rings of iron 
carbonate and iron sulfides, and also contain magnetite 
and pyrrhotite.  These minerals bear strong resemblance 
to mineral alterations caused by primitive bacteria on 
Earth.  This diversity of minerals in such a small area, 
formed under the presumed conditions, seem to make a 
non-biological origin unlikely.

Finally, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy has 
revealed the presence of tiny "ovoids" which may actually 
be fossil remnants of tiny (20 to 100 nanometer) bacteria.  
If so, they are 100 times smaller than any bacteria 
microfossils found on Earth, except for some supposed 
"nanofossils" recently discovered in very young 
terrestrial rocks, a finding currently not generally 
accepted as fossil organisms.
<p>
Taken together, the findings are thought to be strong 
evidence pointing to primitive bacterial life on Mars.  
The PAHs, unusual mineral phases, and "microfossils" 
were all located within a few micrometers of one another, 
indicating a relationship which may require a biological 
explanation.  However, much work will be done on this 
in the future, including searching for amino acids, 
other fossil structures such as cell walls, other 
types of fossils, and fossils of bacteria frozen in the 
act of reproducing.  Mars is almost certain to have 
been warmer and wetter in its distant past, so the 
existence of primitive life has been a tantalizing 
possibility for some time, but the real search may be  
just beginning.
