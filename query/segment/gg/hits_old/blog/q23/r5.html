<h1>Life on Mars</h1>
<i>Michael Caplinger, Malin Space Science Systems</i>
April 1995
<p>

In 1877, Giovanni Schiaparelli produced the first "modern" map of
Mars, on which he showed a system of what he called <i>canali</i>.
Although <i>canali</i> in Italian means "channel", without the
implication of being an artificial feature, the word was commonly
translated into English as "canal".<p>

In 1910, Percival Lowell captured the imagination of the public with
his book <cite>Mars As the Abode of Life</cite>.  Based on his
extensive visual observations (and as we know today, an active
imagination) Lowell painted a compelling portrait of a dying planet,
whose inhabitants had constructed a vast irrigation system to
distribute water from the polar regions to the population centers
nearer the equator.<p>

Despite its appeal to the public, the astronomical community never
gave serious credence to the details of Lowell's theory.  The failure
of many observers to confirm the existence of the canals eventually
led scientists to suspect that their colleagues had been fooled into
seeing the canals, by the difficulty in resolving fine detail from
Earth and their own desire to believe.  (This map, constructed from
Viking orbiter images in the same format as Schiaparelli's -- south is
up -- shows no sign of the canals, though a few features may have been
interpreted as such.)<p>

But the Lowell-inspired idea of an Earthlike Mars proved more durable.
At the dawn of the space age, Mars was considered to have an
atmosphere about a tenth the density of Earth's, water ice polar caps
that waxed and waned with the seasons, and an annual "wave of
darkening" that was often interpreted as growing plant life.<p>

In the 1960s, observations from Earth and flyby spacecraft signalled
the beginning of the end for Lowell's Mars.  The Mariner 4, 6, and 7
missions returned images of a moonlike, heavily-cratered surface.  The
atmosphere was found to be almost pure carbon dioxide (CO2), only a
hundredth the density of Earth's, and the polar caps proved to be
almost entirely frozen CO2.  The first global views of Mars, returned
by the Mariner 9 orbiter in 1972, revealed that the planet was far
more complex than the earlier flyby missions had shown, with huge
volcanoes, an enormous canyon system, and evidence of running water at
some point in the past.  But the wave of darkening was shown to be the
result of seasonal redistribution of windblown dust on the surface,
the atmosphere's composition and density were confirmed, and most of
the evidence for an Earthlike Mars was swept away.<p>

But despite all these blows, the possibility of organisms on the
surface could not yet be ruled out.  For this reason, in 1976 the <a
href="../vl.html">Viking landers</a> carried a sophisticated
instrument to look for possible life forms on the martian surface.<p>

<h2>The Viking Biology Experiment</h2>

The Viking biology experiment weighed 15.5 kg (34 lbs) and consisted
of three subsystems: the Pyrolytic Release experiment (PR), the
Labeled Release experiment (LR), and the Gas Exchange experiment
(GEX).<p>

In addition, independent of the biology experiments, Viking carried a
Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) that could measure the
composition and abundance of organic compounds in the martian soil.
(It should be noted that <it>organic</it> is a chemical term simply
meaning "carbon-containing", and does not require the presence of
life, although all life on Earth does contain carbon.)<p>

<h3>Labeled Release</h3>

<img src=lr.gif><p>

The LR experiment moistened a 0.5-cc sample of soil with 1 cc of a
nutrient consisting of distilled water and organic compounds.  The
organic compounds had been labeled with radioactive carbon-14.  After
moistening, the sample would be allowed to incubate for at least 10
days, and any microorganisms would hopefully consume the nutrient and
give off gases containing the carbon-14, which would then be detected.
(Terrestrial organisms would give off CO2, carbon monoxide (CO), or
methane (CH4).)<p>

<h3>Gas Exchange</h3>

<img src=gex.gif><p>

The GEX experiment partially submerged a 1-cc sample of soil in a
complex mixture of compounds the investigators called "chicken soup".
The soil would then be incubated for at least 12 days in a simulated
martian atmosphere of CO2, with helium and krypton added.  Gases that
might be emitted from organisms consuming the nutrient would then be
detected by a gas chromatograph -- this instrument could detect CO2,
oxygen (O2), CH4, hydrogen (H2), and nitrogen (N2).<p>

<h3>Pyrolytic Release</h3>

<img src=pr.gif><p>

Of the three Viking biology experiments, only the PR experiment
approximated actual martian surface conditions and did not use water.
In this experiment, a 0.25-cc soil sample was incubated in a simulated
martian atmosphere of CO2 and CO labeled with carbon-14.  A xenon arc
lamp provided simulated sunlight.  After 5 days, the atmosphere was
flushed and the sample heated to 625 degrees C (1157F) to break down,
or <em>pyrolyze</em>, any organic material, and the resulting gases
were passed through a carbon-14 detector to see if any organisms had
ingested the labeled atmosphere.</p>

<h3>The Results</h3>

The most important result for the detection of life came not
from the biology experiment, but from the GCMS.  It found no trace of
any organic compound on the surface of Mars.  Organic compounds are
known to be present in space (for example, in meteorites), so this
result came as a complete surprise.  The GCMS was definitely working,
however, because it was able to detect traces of the cleaning solvents
that had been used to sterilize it prior to launch.<p>

The total absence of organic material on the surface made the results
of the biology experiments moot, since metabolism involving organic
compounds were what those experiments were designed to detect.
However, the results from the biology experiments were sufficiently
confusing to be worth examining.<p>

To reduce the chance of false positives, the biology experiments not
only had to detect life in a soil sample, they had to <em>fail</em> to
detect it in another soil sample that had been heat-sterilized (the
<em>control</em> sample).  Had terrestrial life been tested with the
Viking biology instrument, the following results would have been
expected:<p>

<pre>
	response for		response for
	sample			heat-sterilized control

GEX	oxygen or CO2 emitted	none
LR	labeled gas emitted	none
PR	carbon detected		none
</pre>

If life was completely absent from Mars, as the GCMS results
suggested, these should have been the results from the biology
experiments:<p>

<pre>
	response for		response for
	sample			heat-sterilized control

GEX	none			none
LR	none			none
PR	none			none
</pre>

In highly simplified form, these were the actual results from Mars:<p>

<pre>
	response for		response for
	sample			heat-sterilized control

GEX	oxygen emitted		oxygen emitted
LR	labeled gas emitted	none
PR	carbon detected		carbon detected
</pre>

The fact that both the GEX and PR experiments produced positive
results even with the control sample indicates that non-biological
processes are at work.  Subsequent laboratory experiments on Earth
demonstrated that highly-reactive oxidizing compounds (oxides or
superoxides) in the soil would, when exposed to water, produce
hydrogen peroxide.  Oxidized iron, such as maghemite, could act as a
catalyst to produce the results seen by the PR experiment.<p>

Only the LR experiment appears to have met the criteria for life
detection, and it does this rather ambiguously.  When the nutrient was
first injected, there was a rapid increase in the amount of labeled
gas emitted.  Subsequent injections of nutrient caused the amount of
gas to decrease initially (which is surprising if biological processes
were at work) but then to increase slowly.  No response was seen in
the control sample sterilized at the highest temperature (160C, 320F.)
While there is still some controversy, the consensus opinion is that
the LR results can also be explained non-biologically.<p>

<h2>Extinct Life</h2>

Most researchers now believe that the results of the Viking biology
experiments can explained by purely chemical processes that do not
require the presence of life, and the GCMS results completely rule out
life in any event.  Thus, there is no detectable life at the two
Viking landing sites, which were widely separated and different in
character (the Viking 2 landing site was specifically chosen because
of its high latitude, since it was closer to polar water sources.)
While the possibility of "oases" of more favorable conditions for life
cannot be eliminated, for example in subsurface permafrost layers or
in geothermal vents near volcanoes, the chances that life exists on
Mars at the present time do not seem good.<p>

However, we have seen <a href="../channels/channels.html">evidence
that Mars may have been significantly wetter</a>, perhaps with a
denser atmosphere, earlier in its history.  If so, there is the
possibility that life arose on Mars, only to die out as conditions on
the planet worsened.  Therefore, some researchers have suggested that
future searches for life on Mars be shifted to focus on extinct,
rather than extant, life.<p>

On Earth, such extinct life can be found in the form of
<em>microfossils</em> and <em>stromatolites</em>.  Such forms, as
found in western Australia, are the oldest evidence of life on Earth,
dating from 3.5 billion years ago.  Microfossils are individual
fossilized organisms (typically algae), as much as a few millimeters
in diameter.  Stromatolites are formed when layers of microbial
organisms in shallow lakes or pools are covered with sediments.  The
organisms migrate toward the light after being covered, and the
remaining organic material forms a characteristic layered or domed
structure.<p>

Stromatolites are important because they may be large enough to be
seen by lander (or perhaps even high-resolution orbiter) cameras, and
so some researchers have suggested searching for them near features
that appear to be ancient lakes or bays.  While definitive proof of
biological origin would require microscopic imaging or sample return,
the discovery of such features would lend credibility to the idea of
extinct life.<p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

The question of whether life is common or rare in the universe has
deep philosophical implications.  It is uncertain exactly how life
arose on Earth, so it is difficult to determine how common such
mechanisms are.  But if life also arose on Mars, this would show that
those mechanisms operated not just once, but twice, arguing that life
may well be common elsewhere.<p>

However, the search for life on Mars thus far has been unsuccessful.
Some portion of the scientific community feels that further searches
are a waste of time, while another portion remains neutral or
guardedly optimistic.  In principle, it's simple to prove that there
<em>is</em> life on Mars -- all one need do is find an example.
Proving there isn't life on Mars is much harder.  Even a prolonged
negative search can be countered with the suggestion of yet another,
more inaccessible place in which to look.<p>

In the case of Mars, the issue has been complicated by the emotional
belief in an Earthlike Mars, which has largely been shown to have been
a myth.  Mars is a spectacular place, and will remain so even if it is
finally proved to be lifeless.  Today, we don't know for sure if there
is or ever was life on Mars.  But one thing is certain -- one day,
there will be.
