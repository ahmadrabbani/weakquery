However, every now and then I'm let out of the cage when the opportunity comes up for some fieldwork.  Last month was one of those occasions. I flew out to the Spanish island of Tenerife with a small team of scientists to test some equipment and survey the island for suitable sites to test the next generation of Mars rovers.   (Image: Lewis Dartnell)  Tenerife is a volcanic island, the skyline dominated by the towering bulk of Mount Teide. In the photo above, the streaks of black rock spilling down the side of the mountain are deposits of basalt laid down during the most recent eruptions. The plant to the left is a  tajinaste . These grow in clusters on the mountain, giving me the unnerving impression of being stalked by packs of triffids.    Mount Teide is the highest peak of several within the enormous volcanic caldera that sits like an open sore on the face of Tenerife. The terrain within the caldera is thought to be remarkably Martian-like: a rough and desolate landscape, the ground dry and gravelly, strewn with dark basaltic rocks. Regions devoid of the hardy plants make the perfect location for testing the autonomous navigation and imaging capabilities of the prototype robotic explorers.   The very summit of Teide is still active: a steamy terrain of hydrothermal systems and fumaroles, brightly coloured with mineral deposits. I had been  hoping to field-test some of the equipment I've been working on recently - cameras that use fluorescence to hunt out hidden microbial life, and the summit would have been the perfect place to do it. It is exactly the sort of location that can support diverse microbial populations, plus there is evidence that regions like this existed on Mars in its ancient past.  Unfortunately, things didn't turn out as planned. At the last minute we were unable to get to the site as our local collaborator couldn't get the access passes processed. The film crew for  Clash of the Titans 2 , complete with a fleet of trucks, had descended upon the caldera and had completely swamped the national park office.    (Image:  Derek Pullan   )   Fortunately, I did get some field measurements, as you can (sort of) see in this photo of me under the tarpaulin, and a handful of samples to bring back to the lab so the excursion wasn't a complete washout. But the trip certainly highlighted the difficulties of fieldwork - that even the best laid plans can be thwarted by the most unexpected events (including Hollywood actors pretending to be warring gods).                             tags fieldwork  Lewis Dartnell         Post a comment       Name  Email Address  URL  Remember me?
