Astronomers have become excited by the latest discovery, which they say proves that water favourable for life formed on the red planet more recently than previously thought.   Scientists had always believed water formed more than a billion years ago but the latest discovery is the first sign of liquid forming in the past few hundred thousands years.   Nasa’s latest study, reported in the Journal of Geophysical Research, concluded the liquid likely formed from melting snow, which then trickled into the subsurface and dissolved.   It contained several minerals including hematite, silica and gypsum while ferric sulphates, which are more soluble, also were carried down by the water.

The soil exposed by Spirit’s spinning wheels carries clues that Mars may still be wet.  The seepage could have happened during cyclical climate changes in periods when Mars tilted farther on its axis.  "Liquid water and life kind of go together," said Ray Arvidson, of Washington University in St. Louis, who was involved in the project.  Nasa abandoned plans to extract the rover earlier this year.  The study comes after  Nasa unveiled bold plans for send humans sent one-way to Mars to permanently colonise other planets in space.
