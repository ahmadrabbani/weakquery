Factory, 2 discs, $19.93) Before Steven Spielberg’s “Adventures of Tintin” arrives this winter and imprints its motion-capture versions of Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock on our brains, devoted readers of Hergé’s comic strips might want to check out  this 1991-92 television series . A Canadian-French production that was later shown on HBO, it’s pedestrian, as far as the drama is concerned, but has one inestimable advantage for the purist: The 2-D animation remains absolutely faithful to the look of the original. Season 1 adapts seven of the “Tintin” books in 13 episodes, including classics like “The Crab With the Golden Claws” and “The Blue Lotus.”       A selection of gift ideas from The New York Times.

Factory, 25 discs, $159.99) If you haven’t watched “Barney Miller” since it went off the air, you might remember it as just another lightweight mid-1970s sitcom, like its almost exact contemporary “Happy Days.” But even though the show was a comedy, its mood was informed by the darkness of the times and the troubles of New York City, where it was set. (The Daily News printed “ Ford to City: Drop Dead ” early in Season 2.)  In the pilot Barney’s wife (played by the excellent Barbara Barrie) makes breakfast for her husband, a police captain, while a voice on the radio tells her that in addition to a garbage strike, gang murders and Japanese terrorists, “Two banks on Wall Street were destroyed by explosions in the early hours of the morning.” The Zuccotti Park protesters might want to consider adding this set to their playlist.  The box contains all eight seasons of “Barney Miller,” as well as Season 1 of “Fish,” the spinoff series starring Abe Vigoda.  BORED TO DEATH: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON (HBO, 2 discs, $39.98) In these eight episodes of Jonathan Ames’s lightly barbed, absurdist comedy about emasculation, male bonding and marijuana, the three heroes — part musketeer, part Stooge — have adventures that include visiting a Korean spa in Queens, fleeing through Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn and meeting Kevin Bacon (playing himself) at the Park Slope Ale House. Among its many virtues, “Bored to Death” uses New York locations to greater effect than any other current show.  The set includes deleted scenes, outtakes and commentaries by the central performers, Jason Schwartzman, Zach Galifianakis and Ted Danson.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS: THE COMPLETE SERIES (Universal, 19 discs, $129.99) Having finished its run on NBC in July, the best television drama series of the last five years is now available  in its entirety , along with voluminous commentaries, deleted scenes and story lines, a cast-and-crew interview taped at the William S. Paley Television Festival and a making-of documentary about Season 1.  GIGOLOS (Showtime, 1 disc, $26.98) Showtime’s reality series about male escorts in Las Vegas — which, against all odds, is in the midst of its second season — is the girlfriend experience of premium-cable soft-core pornography: If you tune in for the perfunctory sex, you might just stay around for the romantic misadventures and earnest male bonding of the five amiably pathetic central characters, no matter how contrived or outright fake those scenes are.  LAW & ORDER: THE COMPLETE SERIES (Universal, 104 discs, $699.98) You know somebody who wants this. More than half of the seasons of “Law & Order” — Nos. 9 through 13 and 15 through 20 — had not been available on DVD before the release of this  huge set . (Universal issued Season 14, the last full season with Jerry Orbach as Detective Lenny Briscoe, out of order.) The good news is that the box is being heavily discounted: It’s available from a variety of online retailers for about $450.  MR. MAGOO — THE TELEVISION COLLECTION  (1960-1977) (Shout! Factory, 11 discs, $79.97) This  colorful package gathers the three “Magoo” TV series: “The Mr. Magoo Show,” from 1960-61; “The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo,” from 1964-65; and the Saturday morning show “What’s New Mr. Magoo?,” from 1977. The animated shorts featuring the myopic busybody Magoo, voiced by Jim Backus, were innovative in their time and remain amusing, though the bucktoothed Chinese houseboy Cholley presents a challenge to real enjoyment. The package includes commentaries on some episodes by animation historians.  THE OFFICE: SPECIAL EDITION (BBC, four discs, $39.98) On the 10th anniversary of Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant’s “Office” — the original, with doughier people and deadlier humor than its American remake — BBC reissues  the entire series : the 12 episodes, the two Christmas specials and lots of what Mr. Gervais calls “extra bits.” They include new introductions he and Mr. Merchant recorded for the six episodes in Season 1, as well as a 2007 episode of the British series “Comedy Connections” that gives a history of the show.  There are also two documentaries from earlier “Office” DVD sets, including the one made after the series had concluded, in which Mr. Gervais says: “There’s not even a part of me that thinks, oh, wonder if we could do another one. We just mustn’t.” Words to the wise.  PIE IN THE SKY COMPLETE COLLECTION (Acorn, 13 discs, $119.99) In America Richard Griffiths is an eminence, winner of a Tony Award for “The History Boys” and a member of the royal family of “Harry Potter” regulars. (He played Vernon Dursley in five of the films.) In Britain his résumé also includes TV cop. In “Pie in the Sky” on BBC in the mid-1990s, he played Henry Crabbe, a veteran detective and gourmand desperate to retire and open a restaurant.  In the pilot episode he gets his wish, sort of: As part of the fallout from a police scandal, he’s allowed to walk away and open Pie in the Sky (named after Crabbe’s signature steak and kidney pie) on the condition that he be available to help with cases as needed. It turned out that they needed him 39 more times across  five seasons .  THE STREET COMPLETE COLLECTION (BFS, six discs, $79.98) A series made up of free-standing but intertwined episodes featuring various residents of a single street in Manchester, England, “ The Street ” won two British Academy Television Awards for best drama in its three seasons. It owes a large part of its cachet to a cast that was impressive even by the elevated standards of British TV: Recurring performers included Timothy Spall, Jane Horrocks, Jim Broadbent, Bob Hoskins and Gina McKee, as well as those less familiar to Americans, like Matt Smith (the current Doctor Who), Lee Ingleby (“Inspector George Gently”), Neil Dudgeon (“Midsomer Murders”) and Liz White (Annie in “Life on Mars”).
