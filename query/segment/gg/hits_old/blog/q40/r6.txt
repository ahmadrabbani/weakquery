That's what the Sci-Fi Channel is trying to do by letting computer users "chat" about a television program in progress and watch their comments scroll along the bottom of the TV screen almost simultaneously as the program unfolds. The Sci-Fi Channel's experiment, believed to be the first of its kind, is taking place at 3 A.M. Eastern time with reruns of "The Prisoner," a British series that originally appeared on CBS in 1968 and has become a cult favorite. Patrick McGoohan, the program's creator and star, plays a Government agent stranded on a mysterious island where the inhabitants have been brainwashed into the service of an unseen power called No. 1 and escape is prevented by giant glowing spheres called "rovers" that guard the skyline and shoreline. Through a computer bulletin-board service called Echo, short for East Coast Hangout, the Sci-Fi Channel recruited 25 participants who were fans of "The Prisoner" series and would watch it at 3 A.M. Starting Thursday, three other bulletin-board groups around the country will join the experiment.                       During the program, the participants typed comments into their personal computers, and after a seven-second delay to allow computer and human monitors to delete any obscenities, the comments appeared in two lines at the bottom of viewers' screens, like a weather or sports information ticker. It is distracting to try to watch both the program and the comments, but a "Prisoner" fan would not have that problem, according to Barry Schulman, the Sci-Fi Channel's vice president for programming. "There were only 17 episodes, and they can tell you every scene and all the dialogue," he said. Chat comments on one show last week ranged from the inane to the analytical. One participant known as Roses kept pointing out symbolism: a black cat ("symbol of death"), a flirting maid ("Orpheus theme") and an evil character's Peter Pan outfit ("symbol of immortality"). Others made fun of the hair styles, costumes and dialogue. The concept is reminiscent of "Mystery Science Theater 3000," a program on the cable network Comedy Central, in which a human and two puppet robots comment as the audience watches awful old horror movies. But their comments are scripted. "When you look at Mystery Science Theater it's all sarcasm and biting comments," Mr. Schulman said. "With real people in real time, you get a mix -- both the light, amusing quips and heavier stuff. It's like stream of consciousness." Mr. Schulman hopes the gimmick will attract subscribers to the Sci-Fi Channel, which was started in 1993 by USA Networks and can be seen in 23 million homes out of 63 million homes with cable. The network plans to use the chat format in other programs this summer or in the fall.
