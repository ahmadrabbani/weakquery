Rivera     The term real life “Ghostbusters” is not exactly what I’d call “Ghost Hunters,” but they might be the closest team you will ever find on SCI FI’s “Alternative Reality TV.” Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson are the lead investigators of a not for profit investigative unit they call “TAPS.” With the help of their team, which includes case manager Brian Harnois, interviewer Donna Lacroix, demonologists Carl Johnson and Keith Johnson, and investigator Steve Gonzales, TAPS will travel miles to try and disprove evidence of paranormal activity because if they can’t debunk it then maybe they’ll be able to find evidence of real afterlife activity. The aspect that I really like of these people are that they are all normal human beings with jobs and families outside of their work with TAPS. Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson are plumbers by trade and when they check out a possible haunting, they have to take off from work and leave their wives and kids behind along with other members to investigate claims in which 80 percent turn out to be explainable without having anything to do with ghosts and whatnot.       I enjoyed the human interest on this series because these are people following their passion, but they are not doing it for the money. I’m sure anything they might get is appreciated, but these are people who really put it on the line if anything else because they believe in what they are doing. In the series premiere, one of their staff members loses his job because of his extracurricular activities interfered with his ability to show up to his job. All together I found myself equally interested in seeing how these guys balance their lives with their passions and I admire the dignity and professionalism they endeavor towards so support TAPS and tune in when “Ghost Hunters” premieres as a part of a new block of “Alternative Reality” programming beginning Wednesday, October 6, 2004, at 9pm only on SCI FI.    © Copyright 2004 By Mark A.
