 Politics and its Discontents: My Letter to Jason Kenney Re: Sayed Shah Sharifi

                                   Politics and its Discontents   Reflections, Observations, and Analyses Pertaining to the Canadian Political Scene                  WebCounter                                                      Wednesday, November 16, 2011   My Letter to Jason Kenney Re: Sayed Shah Sharifi    Dear Minister Kenney, I am writing to express both my shock and my disappointment over Canada's failure to honour its word to Sayed Shah Sharifi, the brave Afghan interpreter who risked the wrath of Taliban insurgents to assist our forces in his country. By all accounts a very brave and competent individual, he, along with other interpreters, was promised sanctuary for himself and his family because of service to our military. As has been widely reported, despite the fact that he continues to be at risk, our immigration officials have turned down his application for emigration to Canada, the speculation being that it is retaliation for his having made his plight public, thereby embarrassing your government. I implore you to do the right thing, reverse this decision, and expedite his and his family's passage to Canada. To do anything less can only be seen as a callous and immoral abdication of the promises previously made. Sincerely, Lorne Warwick    Posted by  Lorne   at   3:16 PM                  Email This    BlogThis!
