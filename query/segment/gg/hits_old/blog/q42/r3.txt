I first saw Andrew Coyne on the CBC's political discussion panel, and my impression was one of straightjackets.  -Conservative -Angry -Conservative -Angry -A little bit Angry I thought. -Also, Conservative I do believe these are limited definitions, and in fact they were (and are).  Anyhow, I went to his site, read a hilarious explanation for why his comments section was censored (I haven't become popular enough to even contemplate this possibility, although I wonder what Coyne would think of my audience. Crazy? Normal? Just American?). At any rate, I read two of his essays, "The Left Needs a New Left," and it just reminded me that I have to take more economics classes. Or should I say, an economics class. One of the frustrating things about my degree is that it has focussed almost exclusively on a series of legitimate and compelling issues have to do with the modern state, globalization and media, but all with a backdrop of evil corporations as a quite un-covert explanation for most ills. Far be it for me to rebutt the legitimacy of my area of study, but I have wanted to atleast understand the theory and practice from an different (apparently oppositional) point of view before aligning my support wholeheartedly with "the LEFT."  I completely agree that bottling issues into "Left" and "Right" frequently does nothing to help rationalize consideration of the issue in question. The tendency for the media to be "balanced" by consulting (I really hate this) two people to represent the "Left" and "Right" just furthers this trend. As though that which is political can be broken down into two representative (of their particular "spectrum") and completely mutually exclusive camps.  That said, Coyne and I agree about one thing. The left at its base, is and should always be about the cause of the poor and disadvantaged. The question of how best to serve this cause is the one at issue for Coyne. When the left is pursuing this cause in the best way, that leaves other parties in the unfortunate position of representing the rich and advantaged.  Imagine the electoral appeal if the CPC (Canadian Conservative Party) or the GOP (Grand Old Party a.k.a US Republican Party) suddenly renamed themselves the "rich and advantaged party."  In any case, Coyne's other essay, " How far do we take gay rights " is a fantastic and surprising read. The title gives the impression of an author who slots gay rights into something that can (or is) and should not be taken too far....but what a great disappointment. Read it now socons (sounds cooler than social conservative heh?)! Anyways, another interesting connection, is between what Coyne labels "coherent conservatives" and you guessed it.....Noam Chomsky.  Did any of you know that Noam Chomsky, arch leftist of all fanatical insane leftist crazy nutcases, considers himself a conservative? I say all this facetiously, for the benefit of my American readers who don't read Chomsky but nonetheless know that he is wrong about everything (a "cherrypicker" of facts is their ironclad indictment). Anways. The point is, how can Chomsky be considered a conservative? How can a conservative who supports same sex marriage be considered a conservative? What does it mean to be a "coherent conservative," (that is a conservative who looks at the issue in question, contemplates it seriously and makes up his/her mind according to whether it will best serve the good conduct, sustainability, law and order of the society which they theoretically want to "conserve")?    To understand why, one has to understand why the term neo-conservative evolved to describe neo-conservatives.  Further, one has to examine the traditional philosophies of the English Whigs and Tories in the 19th century.  Actually, I don't know what I'm talking about. Specifically, my knowledge of the whigs and tories ends pretty much here at the end of this sentence.  You're just going to have to go  here for an answer....sorry. One thing I have noticed, however, in blogging with some "conservative" American bloggers, is that quite many aren't really conservatives. A popular view is that a "wall" should be built around America, shutting out illegal (and in some cases, legal economic) immigration. Many also hold that a person should be an "all around man" with skills in all trades. Both views are in radical contrast to economic conservatives (also, complicatedly known as market liberals) who view a society of "all around men" as a one way ticket to economic disaster, and national-labour protectionism (i.e. Ain't no damn immigrants taken our damn jobs!!) as yet another ticket to more of the same. Go figure....and certainly go check out the above link if this is confusing.  I suppose I shall end with a note on how a lack of knowledge never seems to prevent poeple (bloggers especially) from invoking subjects of stunning complexity and breadth only to utterly elide them with a glee snippet of commentary. As Socrates said, only the trully knowldgeable know how unknowledgeable they really are. An application of the converse of this principle is to freely consider those who profess absolute knowledge of a topic to know little about it at all.

Posted by:  Matt Hurley |  May 29, 2005 at 08:57 AM     As for the WALL...that's a bit of hyperbole on my part. I am not against legal immigration. I AM against illegal immigration. Law and order has to mean something otherwise what is the point of having any laws? I'm NOT for anarchy. Of course, to liberals such as yourself, if you want to enforce immigration laws, you are some kind of evil HALLIBURTON operative... What is wrong with asking people who come here to obey the law? And what is wrong with making sure that the people who come here obey the law? Furthermore...if the situation with the poor and middle class is as bad as liberals make it out, why EXPAND that situation by allowing people in here who can't even speak the language?   Posted by:  Matt Hurley |  May 29, 2005 at 09:05 AM     Haha. Gotcha.  A true economic conservative would disagree with you regarding the latter sentence "...if the situation witht the poor and middle class...etc" Economists would say, let the market adjust labour pricing according to regional disparities in supply and demand. If prices were insufficient to justify immigration, the market would have it that prices would decline.  Protectionism is a method of obstructing the perfect functioning of labour markets. Take protectionism out, and in-flows and out-flows of people (of all skill levels) will gradually match price parity.  Speaking the language again, has no relevance if the labour performed is low level and menial.  That only becomes an issue for competition for higher level jobs, which presumably illegal immigrants are not in a position to do.    Posted by: Peter Konefal |  May 29, 2005 at 09:23 AM     I'm going to go ahead and disagree with you on the whole "true" economic conservatives would disagree with me bit. The reality is that illegal immigration has been a drain on our economy. Once the facts of that are revealed, the "true" economic conservative would be right with me. Again, it isn't about the language barrier interfering with the work...it's the age old problem of illegals not being able to pay for stuff. Health care, for example, ain't cheap you know... And don't confuse "true" economic conservativism with plain old evil capitalism...there is a difference if you care to look for it. Straight capitalists would be against my plan...because of the reasons you cite; but "true" economic conservatives take the view that the economy has to serve its purpose and not simple just exist in and of itself. Let me explain that last bit... Capitalists care only about the profit of the product minus the cost of the labor. "True" economic conservatives care about the impact of the "cheap labor" on the rest of the economy...therein lies the difference.   Posted by:  Matt Hurley |  May 31, 2005 at 07:34 AM     What no wall??? I am a fiscal conservative and a social liberal as the definitions of the terms are understood. What irks me is the belief that espousing one issue within an ideology means that you have bought into the entire systemic belief structure. For example, I advocated tax cuts when the U.S. economy was fighting recession, that does not mean that I advocate tax cuts when government programs are funded at reasonable levels and the budget is still in deficit. As for Chomsky, defend his published views on USSR and Cuba. You accord him far more lattitude than you have in my experience any other pundit. If the cherry-picked facts do not square with observable reality, who are you going to believe...him or your own eyes?   Posted by: Mahatma |  May 31, 2005 at 09:45 AM     Don't get me wrong Mahatma, I want the wall...its just that I acknowledge that my calling for it is hyperbole... :)   Posted by:  Matt Hurley |  May 31, 2005 at 12:23 PM     I enjoyed reading this.
