<font size="3">Since we don't recognize a Sir John A. Macdonald day, I can't see Parliament agreeing to a Louis Riel day.</font>

<p>
<B><li><font size="3"> Louis Riel is hereby recognized as a Father of Confederation</B></font>

<font size="3">Riel was obviously instrumental in the creation of Manitoba.   We need to keep in mind that our Fathers of Confederation were not perfect and evaluate Riel in the context of that time and situation.</font>

</li></p>

<p>
<B><li><font size="3">authorize the placing of a statue of Louis Riel on Parliament Hill</B></font>

<font size="3">Apparently, Parliament Hill is reserved for statues of people who deserve a place of honor in Canadian history. </font>
</blockquote>
</li></p>

<p>
<B><li><font size="3">reverse Riel's conviction.</B></font><Br>
<font size="3">This recommendation is presented in the Act along with a  list of 23 historical points.  Although those points are in chronological order, they still serve to cloud the issue because there are only three points that are relevant.   Those three points are listed below so you can see how <U>the impression that is given is incomplete and misleading</U>:</font></p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font size="3">(p)  &nbsp;  all of the petitions sent by the Metis to the Government of Canada requesting a redress of the people's grievances and the recognition of their rights were ignored;</font><Br>
 
<font size="3">(q)      &nbsp;   the Government of Canada responded by sending troops against the Metis at Batoche;</font><Br>

<font size="3">(r)      &nbsp;   the Metis, under the leadership of Louis Riel and Gabriel Dumont, defended their homes;</font> </p>
</li>
</OL>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3"><B><U>My analysis</U>:</B> &nbsp;  In (q) the reader and petition signer is not told why the Government of Canada responded by sending troops.  This is critical information which is not provided.   In (r) the reader is informed that the Metis were only defending their homes.  These points give the misleading impression that the Metis and Louis Riel didn't do anything wrong.  As you read about the events leading up to the Battle of Duck lake, you will realize that the Metis were not completely innocent.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size="3"><B>So the Louis Riel Act is flawed.  &nbsp;  It is not an attempt to achieve a reasonable and acceptable balance.</B>  In practical terms, <U>what it will do is provoke and irriate</U>.

Sorry, did I say exonerate?  Try glorify." </font></p>

There might even be a statue raised to him on Parliament Hill."

<p align=left><font size="2">"Now if the issue were only the justice of his sentence, his defenders might have a case.  There is good reason to think that Riel was insane at the time, and the death penalty is barbaric in any event.  A bill to commute his sentence to life imprisonment would surely be worthy of support.  But to say, no to legislate, that he did not do what in plain historical fact he did: to attempt to overthrow the government by force of arms?  That he was, what is more, a Father of Confederation?"

<TD>

<p align=left>Andrew Coyne is concerned that Riel could be glorified.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</TD>

<TD>

<p align=left><B>Should Riel be glorified?</B>  Historical figures must be depicted realistically because this is the first step towards general acceptance of their true worth.   Glorifying a controversial person simply makes opponents to that person more upset and angry.  The result of this is a lack of acceptance of the historical figure and a country which is more divided.</p>

<p align=left>Riel was the key person in the creation of Manitoba, so like Joey Smallwood from Newfoundland, he deserves to be called a father of Confederation.   Even though Riel was found guilty of high treason in 1885, it does not undo the fact that he was instrumental in the creation of Manitoba fifteen years earlier.</p>
 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<p align=left>Mr. Coyne also claims that<Br>
 Riel attempted to overthrow the government by force of arms.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</TD>

<TD>
<p align=left>Mr. Coyne chooses to simplify the events with <B>the claim that Riel attempted to overthrow the government by force of arms.</B>  &nbsp;  In my view, this is a misleading encapsulation of everything that happened which fails to put things in context.<Br>
    &nbsp;     &nbsp;    &nbsp;  <u><B>Riel must be judged from a broader and more accurate perspective</B></u>.<Br>

What happened in the Red River settlement was in response to the Metis finding themselves in a complex, difficult, and frustrating  situation. </p>

<p align=left>Without any input from the Metis, the Canadian government purchased the land the Metis had spent their lives on, began governing them without giving them any say, and then made bad decisions that had a strong impact on the Metis.    When the Metis took over Fort Garry there was no violence.   So, Mr. Coyne's simple statement that Riel did  "attempt to overthrow the government by force of arms" does not accurately reflect what happened.</p>

</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<p align=left>Andrew Coyne reminds us that Riel " . . . led not one but two armed uprisings against the legitimate constitutional government of Canada . . ."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</TD>
<TD>

<p align=left>In the period before 1885, <B>Riel and the Metis did their best to solve their problems by peaceful means.</B>  It was not a time when picketing would do any good or when the news media could present the issues and demand fairness and justice on everybody's television at 6 o'clock.   While we can criticize Riel and the Metis for failing to be extremely patient, we also need to appreciate that they struggled for decades with bad treatment.  They faced the White "civilization" which had strong biases and which was influenced by groups who were racist.  Under the circumstances, there was little to indicate that eventually the Metis would be treated fairly. </p>

<p align=left>But, while we can sympathize with the Metis and Natives, <font size="4">we must not lose sight of the fact that treason is a serous crime.</font>  &nbsp;  Today, when someone becomes bitter, then makes a bad decision and commits murder, we do not sympathize with him and say he is a nice guy and it was only a mistake.   For the most part, we ignore all the times he was a nice guy and the good things he has done in his life, and look at the deliberate act of murder.  Then, he is sent to prison.  Likewise, when people take up arms against the government, we must be careful not to sympathize too much.  Many people died.  In many ways treason is far worse than murder.</p>

</TD>

<TR>
<TD>

<p align=left>Mr. Coyne claims that Riel ignored the list of rights that the Metis drew up. He criticizes Riel for adding his own demands for provincial status and separate schools by saying that they "very nearly scuppered the negotiation."</p>

<p align=left>Andrew Coyne continues by quoting that Riel "may seriously have considered the alternative of annexation to the United States."  Later, he concludes his column with an emotional statement: "If we cannot convict a man who would destroy the country by violent means, what is left of treason?"</p>

</TD>

<TD>

<p align=left>In fact, <B>Riel was part of the process in 1879, when the list of rights were drawn up by the Metis</B>, so he agreed with the list of rights.  While Riel's additions could have "scuttled the process," they didn't.  The fact that the additions were also accepted suggest that Riel may have known what he was doing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align=left><B>Mr. Coyne says that Riel was a man who would destroy the country by violent means</B>.  But, just because one of the alternatives that Riel was <B><U>considering</U></B> in their complex and difficult situation was to join the United States does not mean he should be accused of destroying the country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align=left>He also quotes this description of Riel by historian Donald Creighton.</p>

<p>He claims that Riel was:</p>

<LI>full of delusions of grandeur,</LI>

<LI>quickly infuriated when his will was crossed,</LI>

</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr. Coyne then adds his own conclusion:  "A revolutionary, in other words."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</TD>


<TD>

<p align=left><B>Many writers have assumed that Riel was insane</B> at the time, and even Riel's lawyers believed that his best defense was to claim insanity.   However, we need to keep in mind that Riel was a Metis, and he was deeply religious.  It is extremely difficult to understand and pass fair judgment on this, especially if you are a rational, analytical White person with different background and beliefs.</p>

<p align=left>As well, Riel was living a life full of uncertainty, and he had to adjust to the extremes in his life.  At one point he hit a high by helping to create a province in a dramatic fashion and being so popular that he was elected to the Canadian Parliament.   This contrasts with his life immediately afterwards in which he was unable to help the Manitoba Metis while they were mistreated.  As well, he had to live in the United States and avoid capture due to the $5,000 reward that was offered. [Also, Maggie Siggins in <I>Riel: A Life of Revolution</I> gives reasons to believe that Riel faked his insanity.  p. 279] </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align=left>  Coyne states that "perhaps our greatest historian," Creighton states that Riel was <B>an able but temperamental and dictatorial man</B>.  However, Riel spent months preparing the 1884 petition and trying to make it agreeable to everyone.  As well, in 1879 in Manitoba he worked with other Metis to help create their "Bill of Rights."   This is not the work of a dictator.  Also, the natural role of religious leaders (such as a priest) is to give directions.  I have not heard of anyone who has accused a Priest of being a dictator.</p>

<p align=left>He adds that Riel was <B>full of delusions of grandeur</B>.  This assumption has been made by many, not just Mr. Coyne.  While in a sense this is true, we must keep in mind that Riel's dreams and plans to help the Metis were much closer to reality than what people realize.  We must take into account that Riel had already accomplished the impossible, by creating a new Province in a dramatic and surprisingly non-violent way.  As well, the Metis had confidence in their fighting ability, confidence that White people and some historians tend to overlook.  (See details on the amazing Battle of Grand Côteau three paragraphs down.) </p>

<p align=left>It is also stated that Riel was <B>quite without compunction in the use of force</B>.  However, it was Riel who wanted to gain settlement in 1885 using peaceful means, and he is the one who told Dumont that he did not want the railway blown up.  The impression that his  personal diary gives is that, in spite of what Riel stated in his irrational outbursts, he had a strong preference for peace.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align=left>Some people probably <B>label Riel as a revolutionary</B> because they are unaware of the full story.  In order to allow an unbiased evaluation of events, my account avoids detailed descriptions about Riel's strong desire to help his people, about how the Metis felt in response to all the injustices they experienced, or about their frustrations with the government.  So, an unfeeling and uncaring person can still read the account and say the Metis struggles were not a big deal and that Riel was there just to cause trouble.  It is time for us to put things in the context of what actually happened and give the Metis respect.</p>

<blockquote>

<h2 align=center>The Battle of Grand Côteau</h2>

<p align=left>One reason why it appears that both Riel and the Metis were extremely optimistic about the outcome of using force against the government is because of their past experiences.  They were proud of how effective they had been in past battles.   The following will help you to understand why:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align=left>Around 1853, a small group of Metis traveled into Sioux territory while they were looking for buffalo.   When the Sioux saw them, the Metis quickly formed their wagons into a circle.  Rifle pits were dug around the outside to protect the men; the women stayed on the inside, behind the wagons.</p>

<p align=left>The Sioux held talks with the Metis during the first day, but they could not come to an agreement.</p>

<p align=left>The next morning, just after dawn, about 2,500 Native warriors appeared on the horizon.  They faced the 77 armed Metis.  Gabriel Dumont, who was only 13 years old at the time, was also in the rifle pits.</p>

<p align=left>The Sioux attacked.  They rode round the Metis, firing their guns and shooting arrows.  Sometimes, they would charge at a Metis weak spot.  But the Metis sharpshooters were able to stop every charge.</p>

<p align=left>At the end of the day, the Natives retreated.   While about 80 Sioux had died, the Metis did not lose anyone.</p>

<p align=left>The Sioux had been known as one of the fiercest tribes on the plains.  After this battle, the Sioux never again made a major attack on the Metis.  [About 15 years later, it was the Sioux who wiped out General Custer and his entire Seventh Calvary at the battle of the Little Big Horn.]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align=left><B>November 5, 1998:</B></p>

<p align=left><B>Hello Mr Brown;</B><Br>

I read with interest your rather biased account of the 1885 Metis resistance, perhaps you would take a more non-biased aproach if you had read a few other points of view, may I suggest Maggie Siggins Book <I>"Loius Riel" the life of a revolutionary</I>, We are very familiar with Flanigans aproach to history and consider him to not only biased but r &nbsp; -  &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp;  If you are really interested in the Metis viewpoint of history, it is available.</p>

<p align=left>One of the best outsider's books on Riel and 1885 is <I>Strange Empire</I> written by an American. If I can help you access other books and sources of information, you have only to ask.</p>

In response to finally finding time to read Maggie Siggin's Book <I>Riel: A Life of Revolution</I>, I made a few minor modifications and additions to my account.  Flannagan's evaluation of Riel and the Metis also gives me difficulties, so I recommend that the reader read the critical and insightful letter that is published in Maggie Siggin's Book on page 453. </B></p>

<h2 align=center>In June (1999) I got another e-mail:</h2>


<p align=left><B>Hello again Mr. Brown:</B><Br>
I have just looked at your addition to the 1885 Battle of Batoche and I
again disagree with your slant . . . .  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Perhaps you will find there is another
slant to instaed of Mr, Flanagans and assoc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p align=left>I did some more research but didn't get far until I got the following e-mail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align=left><B>Hello Again Mr.Brown:</B><Br>
I have found in my files a copy of "The Beaver"Summer 1985, on page 36 and
on is an articule titled "The Bremner Furs".</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p align=left>Since I had carefully researched my account about ten years before, I was reluctant to make changes.  However, after reviewing the article on "The Bremner Furs" and a book on Metis land claims, and careful consideration </p>
</blockquote>


<h2 align=center>I made the following changes:</h2>

<p><b>From:</b><Br>
Middleton became a national hero and he was knighted by the Queen. But later, <b>he was accused of taking furs from a Metis.</b> The resulting scandal ruined his reputation, so he returned to England.</p>

<p><b>To:</b><Br>
Middleton became a national hero and he was knighted by the Queen.
But later, <B><I>it was discovered that he had taken furs from an English Metis.</I></B>
The resulting scandal ruined his reputation, so he returned to England. </p>

<blockquote><p align=left>As well, the following paragraph was added to give the reader a better feeling for how things turned out for the Metis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><B><I>Unfortunately, the Metis were not able to make good use of some of the land
they were awarded, and they did not understand the long term value of it.
White speculators took advantage of the Metis, bought their land grants, and
made huge profits.</I></B></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align=left>Since that is the final paragraph, it puts a different slant on the entire account.  I now feel that my account gives a fairer impression of what happened and I am grateful for the feedback.</p>

<p>The Metis responded in another e-mail : "Yes after reading your comments, I think you are getting closer to the truth. . . . "</p>
