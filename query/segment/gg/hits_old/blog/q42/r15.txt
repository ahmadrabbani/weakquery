 Silly Little Country: A Very Nice Summary from Andrew Coyne

   Silly Little Country     Wednesday, October 01, 2008  A Very Nice Summary from Andrew Coyne   From the stomach-turning arts subsidy discussion in the Canadian leaders' debate - Coyne summarizes what Harper actually quite sensibly said, which hardly got well-put tonight: 9:32 PM Andrew Coyne - He never said ordinary Canadians don’t relate to the arts. He said they didn’t relate to subsidized artists, at subsidized galas, complaining about subsidy cuts that haven’t happened. Amen! (And I am someone who exploits those subsidies like mad by getting theatre and opera tickets at far below what would be their cost, thanks to millions of people who probably earn a lot less, neither go to theatre or opera, but contribute through our government arts subsidy programs to my tickets. Thanks, guys!)   posted by Alan Adamson @  9:34 PM               0 Comments:  Post a Comment  << Home     Life in Toronto, Canada About Me    Name:  Alan Adamson   Location: Toronto, Ontario, Canada   View my complete profile    © 2005, 2009 Alan Adamson Previous Posts A Lovely Mondegreen  Recommendation for Tomorrow Night's Debate  Malalai Kakar - I Had no Great Idea for a Post on ...
