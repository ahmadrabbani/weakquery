 CBC Exposed: CBC won’t tell how much Andrew Coyne et al are being paid ...

                                   CBC Exposed                   Welcome to a new, grass roots campaign to examine the activities of the CBC, owned by we the people, and in particular, to review concerns about possible abuse of power, content bias and special privileges of the CBC executives. In addition to the billions of dollars CBC receives from advertising and cable/satellite fees, similar to CTV and Global, the CBC also demands and receives a subsidy of almost one billion two hundred million dollars of our tax money for their operations-including huge bonuses to Executives every year. There is continued resistance from the CBC to obtaining information about how the taxpayer’s money is spent, for example, if a taxpayer uses the Access to Information process as a means of last resort to get information they discover that the CBC routinely blocks their attempts. Please read on and visit here often for new stories about how your money is spent at the powerful CBC.                                                      CBC won’t tell how much Andrew Coyne et al are being paid ...    Brian Lilley from Sun News keeps up the digging to find out where our $1.2B of taxpayers money is going at the CBC but ran into another snub finding out the price to bring political pundits on the At Issue Panel. Besides the appearance fees, Lilley was looking for travel, accommodation, meals and hospitality costs of having the likes of Macleans’ Andrew Coyne get to Toronto each week for the 10 minute gig. CBC is refusing to give out this info saying it “touches on their programming and journalism”. How taxpayers knowing the costs to have Coyne and the rest of the Panel brought in on the taxpayers’ dime to the studio each week instead of on video feed is somehow a journalistic issue, defies logic. The CBC is only stonewalling as they know expenses like these drive people nuts and are sure to prove embarrassing. Read full story and responses  here .             Email This    BlogThis!

The privileged government media giant,  Canadian Broadcasting Corporation - the  CBC , is out of control, a bull in the proverbial china shop, with huge amounts of money pouring into their abyss of spending waste every day.  And, it’s not enough to spend the vast amount of money they receive from advertising revenues and from the viewer fees gobbled up from the public – paid to them from the cable and satellite companies – no, that is not enough money for the untouchable,  powerful CBC execs .  They demand and get more money from the federal bureaucrats and politicians.  Unfortunately, that ‘more’ is a lot of money and it comes from the little guys such as you, the taxed to death taxpayers of Canada.   The  CBC receives a  billion dollars plus, every year from us and the Corp., as they are called, have special powers to prevent any normal public investigation of their funding expenses- expenses such as compensation to senior executives and to talent, and on their huge spending for programming content costs. Mega public money is devoured by them every day with  little accountability . Their competition, CTV and Shaw/Global, for example, survive and indeed prosper from the advertising and cable/satellite fees earned.  However, this significant amount of normal broadcast industry standard revenue, easily capable of making a private sector broadcast group happy, is not sufficient for the  money burning privileged CBC .  In fact, we taxpayers are giving them more than an additional one billion dollars every year.   Yes that’s $1 billion .  More than one billion dollars of your tax money, plucked out of your pocket and given as a  free gift to this government owned media service every twelve months .  And, if that is not enough to shock you, please know that the CBC continues to operate in an arrogant ‘ we are exempt from the rules’ manner, making it difficult for the public to access any information about how they operate.  To attempt to find out how much the Corp. pays their talent, or to simply have a review of their budgets, perhaps see how they run their programming and ‘objective’ news operation, you will likely have to fight hard including pursuing the difficult ‘ access to information ’ process-and years later if you do get it the info you requested may be redacted. Good luck trying.   CBC executives continue to act as if we the  taxpayers are just an unlimited ATM vehicle for their pleasure.  Enough is Enough.  It’s time for a change!  Please read through this new  grass roots blog and we invite you to  join with us to take some affirmative  action.  Vote here to sell the CBC or  send a complaint to the CBC’s government regulatory  body, the CRTC. Do you w ork at the CBC, or are you a former employee? (We know many hard working employees there, they are not the problem, the  CBC execs are the problem ) so become a  whistleblower, send in your news story, your videos exposing the  CBC exec s ‘wasteful management . Together we can make a positive difference.   We can tell the people in charge, the senior politicians and bureaucrats who can make this change, that it is not acceptable to reach into our pocketbooks to grab one billion dollars every year to give to a privileged, arrogant government owned out of control media service.  It’s time to say no, to say ‘you’re hard earned tax money is not to be wasted anymore, that you are mad as hell and not going to take it anymore’. We need change.  Act now!  It’s time to sell the CBC .  Use those billions in proceeds from the sale plus also keep the more than one billion dollars wasted in that giant media ATM cave every year, to invest it into something of real value- health care, education, the arts, or perhaps cut our taxes?
