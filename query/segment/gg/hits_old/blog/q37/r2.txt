  Filbeck-Cann & King Funeral Home & Crematory Benton and Daffenville Kentucky Funeral and Cremation                                              Listen to our special audio messages                   Our beautiful surroundings are comforting, as well.           We’ll work with you to make the service meaningful and personal.       Personal Service Means Many Things  Of course, you can depend on us to personally attend to your wishes and desires when the need arises, any time of the day or night. To us, the word personal means much more.  Since no two people are alike, we believe that no two funerals should be alike, either. So we offer a plan called the  Celebration of Life, as well as specially themed memorial programs. With our programs, you’ll plan a service that honors your loved one’s life just the way you want, and creates a time for personal expressions of remembrance. Ask us how you can create a funeral service that is as unique as the individual.   TRADITIONAL SERVICES    Since Filbeck-Cann & King is heir to a long tradition of family funeral service, we offer a complete selection of ways to honor and commemorate someone who has died. Today’s contemporary funeral traditions provide many new observances that allow family and friends to say good-bye in meaningful and comforting ways. Our programs offer abundant choices for creating deep meaning through personalization.  Of course, we provide a full range of cremation services, as well. You may have heard that choosing cremation means you can’t have a traditional funeral service, but this is not true. You still have the ability to add thoughtful, personal touches and memorial observances to honor and remember the person who has died.  We own our crematory and exclusively offer a 10-step cremation process backed by our Cremation with Confidence Guarantee that ensures your loved one never leaves our care.                              Our services include:    • Advance Funeral Planning • Personalization Services, including memorial folders, casket and vault personalization, special music, video tributes, “Theme” Funeral Packages, and more •  Celebration of Life Funeral Packages • Cremation Services and Packages •  Online obituaries and  Condolences • Transfer Service/Minimum Required Services • Assistance with Veterans and Social Security filings • Funeral Webcasting • Video Life Tribute  We’ll be happy to explain many other types of observances and services, so that you can select the elements most appropriate for your family. We are always available to help you plan a dignified, meaningful service that commemorates the life that has been lived. Please ask about all the available options and choices.
