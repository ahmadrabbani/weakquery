<h2>Women and Violence</h2>
                                      <p>

<p>

Violence affects the lives of millions of women worldwide, in all
socio-economic and
educational classes. It cuts across cultural and religious
barriers, impeding the right of women
to participate fully in society. <p>

Violence against women takes a dismaying variety of forms, from
domestic abuse and rape to
child marriages and female circumcision. All are violations of the
most fundamental human
rights. <p>

In a statement to the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing
in September 1995, the
United Nations Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said that
violence against women is
a universal problem that must be universally condemned. But he said
that the problem
continues to grow.<p>

     The Secretary-General noted that domestic violence alone is on
the increase. Studies in 10
countries, he said, have found that between 17 per cent and 38 per
cent of women have
suffered physical assaults by a partner. <p>

In the Platform for Action, the core document of the Beijing
Conference, Governments
declared that "violence against women constitutes a violation of
basic human rights and is an
obstacle to the achievement of the objectives of equality,
development and peace".<p>

        <p>

<h3>The Work of the Special Rapporteur</h3>
     The issue of the advancement of women's rights has concerned
the United Nations since the
Organization's founding. Yet the alarming global dimensions of
female-targeted violence were
not explicitly acknowledged by the international community until
December 1993, when the
United Nations General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the
Elimination of Violence
against Women. <p>

Until that point, most Governments tended to regard violence
against women largely as a
private matter between individuals, and not as a pervasive human
rights problem requiring
State intervention.<p>

In view of the alarming growth in the number of cases of violence
against women throughout
the world, the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution
1994/45 of 4 March 1994, in
which it decided to appoint the Special Rapporteur on violence
against women, including its
causes and consequences. <p>

As a result of these steps, the problem of violence against women
has been drawing increasing
political attention.<p>

The Special Rapporteur has a mandate to collect and analyse
comprehensive data and to
recommend measures aimed at eliminating violence at the
international, national and regional
levels. The mandate is threefold:<p>


<ul>
  <li><b></b>To collect information on violence against women and
its causes and consequences from
sources such as Governments, treaty bodies, specialized agencies
and intergovernmental and
non-governmental organizations, and to respond effectively to such
information;</li>
  <li><b></b>To recommend measures and ways and means, at the
national, regional and international
levels, to eliminate violence against women and its causes, and to
remedy its consequences;</li>
  <li><b></b>To work closely with other special rapporteurs,
special representatives, working groups and
independent experts of the Commission on Human Rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Incest, Rape and Domestic Violence</h3>
Some females fall prey to violence before they are born, when
expectant parents abort their
unborn daughters, hoping for sons instead. In other societies,
girls are subjected to such 
traditional practices as circumcision, which leave them maimed and
traumatized. In others,
they are compelled to marry at an early age, before they are
physically, mentally or
emotionally mature.  <p>

Women are victims of incest, rape and domestic violence that often
lead to trauma, physical
handicap or death.  <p>

And rape is still being used as a weapon of war, a strategy used to
subjugate and terrify entire
communities. Soldiers deliberately impregnate women of different
ethnic groups and abandon
them when it is too late to get an abortion. <p>

The Platform for Action adopted at the Fourth World Conference on
Women declared that
rape in armed conflict is a war crime -- and could, under certain
circumstances, be considered
genocide.<p>

Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali told the Beijing Conference that
more women today were
suffering directly from the effects of war and conflict than ever
before in history.  <p>

"There is a deplorable trend towards the organized humiliation of
women, including the crime
of mass rape", the Secretary-General said. "We will press for
international legal action against
those who perpetrate organized violence against women in time of
conflict."<p>

A preliminary report in 1994 by the Special Rapporteur, Ms. Radhika
Coomaraswamy,
focused on three areas of concern where women are particularly
vulnerable: in the family
(including domestic violence, traditional practices, infanticide);
in the community (including
rape, sexual assault, commercialized violence such as trafficking
in women, labour
exploitation, female migrant workers etc.); and by the State
(including violence against women
in detention as well as violence against women in situations of
armed conflict and against
refugee women).<p>

In the Platform for Action adopted at the Beijing Conference,
violence against women and the
human rights of women are 2 of the 12 critical areas of concern
identified as the main
obstacles to the advancement of women. <p>

<h3>Commitments by Governments </h3>
Governments agreed to adopt and implement national legislation to
end violence against
women and to work actively to ratify all international agreements
that relate to violence against
women. They agreed that there should be shelters, legal aid and
other services for girls and
women at risk, and counselling and rehabilitation for perpetrators.
<p>

 Governments also pledged to adopt appropriate measures in the
field of education to modify
the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women. And
the Platform called on
media professionals to develop self-regulatory guidelines to
address violent, degrading and
pornographic materials while encouraging non-stereotyped, balanced
and diverse images of
women.<p>

<h3>Defining Gender-based Abuse</h3>
The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women is the
first international human
rights instrument to exclusively and explicitly address the issue
of violence against women. It
affirms that the phenomenon violates, impairs or nullifies women's
human rights and their
exercise of fundamental freedoms. <p>

The Declaration provides a definition of gender-based abuse,
calling it "any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is
likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm
or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or
arbitrary deprivation of
liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life".<p>

The definition is amplified in article 2 of the Declaration, which
identifies three areas in which
violence commonly takes place:<p>


<ul>
  <li><b></b>Physical, sexual and psychological violence that
occurs in the family, including battering;
sexual abuse of female children in the household; dowry-related
violence; marital rape;
female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful
to women; non-spousal
violence; and violence related to exploitation;</li>
  <li><b></b>Physical, sexual and psychological violence that
occurs within the general community,
including rape; sexual abuse; sexual harassment and intimidation at
work, in educational
institutions and elsewhere; trafficking in women; and forced
prostitution;</li>
  <li><b></b>Physical, sexual and psychological violence
perpetrated or condoned by the State, wherever
it occurs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Groundwork Is Laid in Vienna</h3>
The importance of the question of violence against women was
emphasized over the last
decade through the holding of several expert group meetings
sponsored by the United Nations
to draw attention to the extent and severity of the problem.  <p>

In September 1992, the United Nations Commission on the Status of
Women established a
special Working Group and gave it a mandate to draw up a draft
declaration on violence
against women.<p>

The following year, the United Nations Commission for Human Rights,
in resolution 1993/46
of 3 March, condemned all forms of violence and violations of human
rights directed
specifically against women. <p>

The World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna in June 1993,
laid extensive
groundwork for eliminating violence against women. In the Vienna
Declaration and
Programme of Action, Governments declared that the United Nations
system and Member
States should work towards the elimination of violence against
women in public and private
life; of all forms of sexual harassment, exploitation and
trafficking in women; of gender bias
in the administration of justice; and of any conflicts arising
between the rights of women and
the harmful effects of certain traditional or customary practices,
cultural prejudices and
religious extremism.  <p>

The document also declared that "violations of the human rights of
women in situations of
armed conflicts are violations of the fundamental principles of
international human rights and
humanitarian law", and that all violations of this kind --
including murder, systematic rape,
sexual slavery and forced pregnancy -- "require a particularly
effective response".<p>

<p>

<h3>Kinds of Violence Against Women</h3>
<h4><i>Domestic violence</i></h4>
Violence against women in the family occurs in developed and
developing countries alike.  It
has long been considered a private matter by bystanders --
including neighbours, the
community and government. But such private matters have a tendency
to become public
tragedies. <p>

In the United States, a woman is beaten every 18 minutes. Indeed,
domestic violence is the
leading cause of injury among women of reproductive age in the
United States.  Between 22
and 35 per cent of women who visit emergency rooms are there for
that reason.  <p>

The highly publicized trial of O. J. Simpson, the retired United
States football player acquitted
of the murder of his former wife and a male friend of hers, helped
focus international media
attention on the issue of domestic violence and spousal abuse.  <p>

In Peru, 70 per cent of all crimes reported to the police involve
women beaten by their
husbands.<p>

In Pakistan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto strongly defended a
35-year-old mother of two
who was severely burned by her husband in a domestic dispute.  <p>

"There is no excuse for such a behaviour", the Prime Minister
declared after visiting the
hospitalized victim. "My presence here is to send a message to all
those who violate Islamic
teachings and defy laws of the land with their inhuman treatment of
women.  This will not be
tolerated."  <p>

According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, in the 400
cases of domestic
violence reported in 1993 in the province of Punjab, nearly half
ended with the death of the
wife.<p>

According to the Special Rapporteur's report, many Governments now
recognize the
importance of protecting victims of domestic abuse and taking
action to punish perpetrators.
The establishment of structures allowing officials to deal with
cases of domestic violence and
its consequences is a significant step towards the elimination of
violence against women in the
family. <p>

 The Special Rapporteur's report highlights the importance of
adopting legislation that provides
for prosecution of the offender. It also stresses the importance of
specialized training for law
enforcement authorities as well as medical and legal professionals,
and of the establishment of
community support services for victims, including access to
information and shelters.<p>

<h4><i>Traditional practices</h4>
</i>In many countries, women fall victim to traditional practices
that violate their human rights.
The persistence of the problem has much to do with the fact that
most of these physically and
psychologically harmful customs are deeply rooted in the tradition
and culture of society.<p>

<h4><i>Female genital mutilation</i></h4>
According to the World Health Organization, 85 million to 115
million girls and women in the
population have undergone some form of female genital mutilation
and suffer from its adverse
health effects.  <p>

Every year an estimated 2 million young girls undergo this
procedure. Most live in Africa and
Asia -- but an increasing number can be found among immigrant and
refugee families in
Western Europe and North America. Indeed, the practice has been
outlawed in some European
countries. <p>

In France, a Malian was convicted in a criminal court after his
baby girl died of a female
circumcision-related infection. The procedure had been performed on
the infant at home.  <p>

In Canada, fear of being forced to undergo circumcision can be
grounds for asylum. A
Nigerian woman was granted refugee status since she felt that she
might be persecuted in her
home country because of her refusal to inflict genital mutilation
on her baby daughter.<p>

There is a growing consensus that the best way to eliminate these
practices is through
educational campaigns that emphasize their dangerous health
consequences. Several
Governments have been actively promoting such campaigns in their
countries.<p>

<h4><i>Son preference</i></h4>
Son preference affects women in many countries, particularly in
Asia.  Its consequences can be
anything from foetal or female infanticide to neglect of the girl
child over her brother in terms
of such essential needs as nutrition, basic health care and
education.  <p>

In China and India, some women choose to terminate their
pregnancies when expecting
daughters but carry their pregnancies to term when expecting sons. 
<p>

According to reports from India, genetic testing for sex selection
has become a booming
business, especially in the country's northern regions. Indian
gender-detection clinics drew
protests from women's groups after the appearance of advertisements
suggesting that it was
better to spend $38 now to terminate a female foetus than $3,800
later on her dowry.  <p>

A study of amniocentesis procedures conducted in a large Bombay
hospital found that 95.5 per
cent of foetuses identified as female were aborted, compared with
a far smaller percentage of
male foetuses.<p>

The problem of son preference is present in many other countries as
well. Asked how many
children he had fathered, the former United States boxing champion
Muhammad Ali told an
interviewer: "One boy and seven mistakes."<p>

<h4><i>Dowry-related violence and early marriage</i></h4>
In some countries, weddings are preceded by the payment of an
agreed-upon dowry by the
bride's family.  Failure to pay the dowry can lead to violence. 
<p>

In Bangladesh, a bride whose dowry was deemed too small was
disfigured after her husband
threw acid on her face. In India, an average of five women a day
are burned in dowry-related
disputes -- and many more cases are never reported.<p>

Early marriage, especially without the consent of the girl, is
another form of human rights
violation.  Early marriage followed by multiple pregnancies can
affect the health of women for
life. <p>

The report of the Special Rapporteur has documented the destructive
effects of marriage of
female children under 18 and has urged Governments to adopt
relevant legislation.<p>

<h3>Violence in the community</h3>
<h4><i>Rape</i></h4>
Rape can occur anywhere, even in the family, where it can take the
form of marital rape or
incest.  It occurs in the community, where a woman can fall prey to
any abuser.  It also occurs
in situations of armed conflict and in refugee camps.  <p>

In the United States, national statistics indicate that a women is
raped every six minutes.  In
1995, the case of a Brazilian jogger raped and murdered in New York
City's Central Park
drew international attention once again to the problem. The
incident occurred only a few years
after an earlier sensational jogger-assault case in which the
victim -- an American assaulted in
the same general area of the park -- barely survived after her
assailants left her for dead.<p>

Relations between residents of the Japanese island of Okinawa and
American GIs were thrown
into turmoil in 1995 after two marines and a sailor allegedly
kidnapped and raped a 12-year-old girl.<p>

The Special Rapporteur's report underlines the importance of
education to sensitize the public
about the special horrors of rape, and of sensitivity training for
the police and hospital staff
who work with victims.<p>

<h4><i>Sexual assault within marriage</i></h4>
In many countries sexual assault by a husband on his wife is not
considered to be a crime: a
wife is expected to submit. It is thus very difficult in practice
for a woman to prove that sexual
assault has occurred unless she can demonstrate serious injury. 
<p>

The report of the Special Rapporteur noted that light sentences in
sexual assault cases send the
wrong message to perpetrators and to the public at large: that
female sexual victimization is
unimportant. <p>

<h4><i>Sexual harassment</h4>
</i>Sexual harassment in the workplace is a growing concern for
women.  Employers abuse their
authority to seek sexual favours from their female co-workers or
subordinates, sometimes
promising promotions or other forms of career advancement or simply
creating an untenable
and hostile work environment.  Women who refuse to give in to such
unwanted sexual
advances often run the risk of anything from demotion to dismissal. 
<p>

But in recent years more women have been coming forward to report
such practices -- some
taking their cases to court.  <p>

In her report, the Special Rapporteur stressed that sexual
harassment constitutes a form of sex
discrimination. "It not only degrades the woman", the report noted,
"but reinforces and
reflects the idea of non-professionalism on the part of women
workers, who are consequently
regarded as less able to perform their duties than their male
colleagues." <p>

<h4><i>Prostitution and trafficking</i></h4>
Many women are forced into prostitution either by their parents,
husbands or boyfriends -- or
as a result of the difficult economic and social conditions in
which they find themselves.  They
are also lured into prostitution, sometimes by "mail-order bride"
agencies that promise to find
them a husband or a job in a foreign country.  As a result, they
very often find themselves
illegally confined in brothels in slavery-like conditions where
they are physically abused and
their passports withheld.  <p>

Most women initially victimized by sexual traffickers have little
inkling of what awaits them. 
They generally get a very small percentage of what the customer
pays to the pimp or the
brothel owner.  Once they are caught up in the system there is
practically no way out, and they
find themselves in a very vulnerable situation.  <p>

Since prostitution is illegal in many countries, it is difficult
for prostitutes to come forward and
ask for protection if they become victims of rape or want to escape
from brothels. Customers,
on the other hand, are rarely the object of penal laws. <p>

In Thailand, prostitutes who complain to the police are often
arrested and sent back to the
brothels upon payment of a fine.  <p>

The extent of trafficking in women and girl children has reached
alarming proportions,
especially in Asian countries.  <p>

Many women and girl children are trafficked across borders, often
with the complicity of
border guards.  In one incident, five young prostitutes burned to
death in a brothel fire because
they had been chained to their beds. At the same time, sex tours of
developing countries are a
well-organized industry in several European and other
industrialized countries. <p>

The Special Rapporteur has called on Governments to take action to
protect young girls from
being recruited as prostitutes and to closely monitor recruiting
agencies.   <p>

<h3>Violence against women migrant workers</h3>
Female migrant workers typically leave their countries for better
living conditions and better
pay -- but the real benefits accrue to both the host countries and
the countries of origin.<p>

For home countries, money sent home by migrant workers is an
important source of hard
currency, while receiving countries are able to find workers for
low-paying jobs that might
otherwise go unfilled.<p>

But migrant workers themselves fare badly, and sometimes
tragically. Many become virtual
slaves, subject to abuse and rape by their employers. <p>

In the Middle East and Persian Gulf region, there are an estimated
1.2 million women, mainly
Asians, who are employed as domestic servants.  According to the
independent human rights
group Middle East Watch, female migrant workers in Kuwait often
suffer beatings and sexual
assaults at the hands of their employers. <p>

The police are often of little help.  In many cases, women who
report being raped by their
employers are sent back to the employer -- or are even assaulted at
the police station.  <p>

Working conditions are often appalling, and employers prevent women
from escaping by
seizing their passports or identity papers.  <p>

The report of the Special Rapporteur draws attention to the fact
that there are many
international instruments that can be used to prevent abuse against
migrant women and
suggests some measures to protect the human rights of migrant
women.  <p>

<h4><i>Pornography</i></h4>
Another concern highlighted in the Special Rapporteur's report is
pornography, which
represents a form of violence against women that "glamorizes the
degradation and
maltreatment of women and asserts their subordinate function as
mere receptacles for male
lust".  <p>

<h3>Violence perpetrated or condoned by States</h3>
<h4><i>Custodial violence against women</i></h4>
Violence against women by the very people who are supposed to
protect them -- members of
the law enforcement and criminal justice systems -- is widespread. 
 <p>

Women are physically or verbally abused; they also suffer sexual
and physical torture. 
According to Amnesty International, thousands of women held in
custody are routinely raped
in police detention centres worldwide.  The report of the Special
Rapporteur underlines the
necessity for States to prosecute those accused of abusing women
while in detention and to
hold them accountable for their actions.<p>

<h4><i>Violence against women in situations of armed conflict</i>
</h4>
Rape has been widely used as a weapon of war whenever armed
conflicts arise between
different parties.  It has been used all over the world: in
Chiapas, Mexico, in Rwanda, in
Kuwait, in Haiti, in Colombia.  <p>

Women and girl children are frequently victims of gang rape
committed by soldiers from all
sides of a conflict. Such acts are done mainly to trample the
dignity of the victims.  Rape has
been used to reinforce the policy of ethnic cleansing in the war
that has been tearing apart the
former Yugoslavia. <p>

The so-called "comfort women" -- young girls of colonized or
occupied countries who became
sexual slaves to Japanese soldiers during the Second World War --
have dramatized the
problem in a historical context. Many of these women are now coming
forward and
demanding compensation for their suffering from Japanese
authorities.  "Such rape is the
symbolic rape of the community, the destruction of the fundamental
elements of a society and
culture -- the ultimate humiliation of the male enemy", the report
by the Special Rapporteur
noted. It stressed the need to hold the perpetrators of such crimes
fully accountable.<p>

<h4>V<i>iolence against refugee and displaced women</i></h4>
Women and children form the great majority of refugee populations
all over the world and are
especially vulnerable to violence and exploitation.  In refugee
camps, they are raped and
abused by military and immigration personnel, bandit groups, male
refugees and rival ethnic
groups.  They are also forced into prostitution.  <p>

In her report, the Special Rapporteur proposes the following
measures to be taken for the
protection of women and girls in refugee camps: improvement of
security, deployment of
trained female officers at all points of the refugees' journey,
participation of women in
organizational structures of the camps and prosecution of
government and military personnel
responsible for abuse against refugee women.<p>

<p>

<p>

<h3>Legal steps to criminalize violence against women</h3>
In recent years some countries have taken significant steps towards
improving laws relating to
violence against women. For example:<p>


<ul>
  <li><b></b>In July 1991, Mexico revised its rape law in several
important ways.  A provision was
eliminated that allowed a man who rapes a minor to avoid
prosecution if he agrees to marry
her.  Now judges are required to hand down a decision regarding
access to an abortion
within five working days.</li>
  <li><b></b>On 9 June 1994, the Organization of American States
adopted the Inter-American
Convention to Prevent, Punish and Eradicate Violence against Women
(also called
Convention of Bel&eacute;m do Par&agrave;), a new international
instrument that recognizes all gender-based violence as an abuse of
human rights.  This Convention provides an individual right
of petition and a right for non-governmental organizations to lodge
complaints with the
Inter-American Commission of Human Rights.</li>
  <li><b></b>In Australia, a National Committee on Violence against
Women was established to
coordinate the development of policy, legislation and law
enforcement at the national level
as well as community education on violence against women.</li>
  <li><b></b>In 1991, the Government of Canada announced a new
four-year Family Violence Initiative
intended to mobilize community action, strengthen Canada's legal
framework, establish
services on Indian reserves and in Inuit communities, develop
resources to help victims and
stop offenders, and provide housing for abused women and
children.</li>
  <li><b></b>In Turkey, a Ministry of State for Women was
established whose main goals are, among
others, to promote women's rights and strengthen their role in
economic, social, political
and cultural life.  Legal measures are being adopted towards the
elimination of violence
against women.  The establishment of special courts to deal with
violence is envisaged. 
Psychological treatment for abused women is also planned, along
with the establishment of
women's shelters around the country.  Specially trained female
police officers could provide
assistance to victims of violence.</li>
  <li><b></b>In Burkina Faso, a strong advertising campaign by the
Government as well as television and
radio programmes on the unhealthy practice of genital mutilation
were launched to educate
and raise public awareness about the dangerous consequences of such
an "operation".  A
National Anti-Excision Committee was established in 1990 by the
present head of State. 
Today, the practice of genital mutilation has been eliminated in
some villages of Burkina
Faso.  In others, there has been an incredible drop in the number
of girls excised: only 10
per cent of the girls are excised compared to 100 per cent 10 years
ago.</li>
  <li><b></b>Some countries have introduced police units specially
trained for dealing with spousal
assault.  In Brazil, specific police stations have been designated
to deal with women's
issues, including domestic violence.  These police stations are
staffed entirely by women.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ensuring That Laws Are Obeyed</h3>
These examples illustrate some steps taken at the national level
towards the eradication of
violence against women.  Combating and eradicating this scourge
require enhanced and
concerted efforts to protect women at the local, national and
international levels.<p>

 States have tended to adopt a passive attitude when confronted by
cases of violations of
women's rights by private actors.  Most laws fail to protect
victims or to punish perpetrators. 
Passing laws to criminalize violence against women is an important
way to redefine the limits
of acceptable behaviour.  <p>

States should ensure that national legislation, once adopted, does
not go unenforced.  State
responsibility is clearly underlined in article 4 of the
Declaration on the Elimination of
Violence against Women, which stipulates that "States should
exercise due diligence to
prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national legislation,
punish acts of violence
against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State or
by private persons". <p>

Any approach designed to combat violence must be twofold, 
addressing the root causes of the
problem and treating its manifestations.  Society at large,
including judges and police officers,
must be educated to change the social attitudes and beliefs that
encourage male violence.  <p>

<h3>Challenging Traditional Attitudes</h3>
The meaning of gender and sexuality and the balance of power
between women and men at all
levels of society must be reviewed.  Combating violence against
women requires challenging
the way that gender roles and power relations are articulated in
society.  In many countries
women have a low status.  They are considered as inferior and there
is a strong belief that men
are superior to them and even own them.  <p>

Changing people's attitude and mentality towards women will take a
long time -- at least a
generation, many believe, and perhaps longer.  Nevertheless,
raising awareness of the issue of
violence against women, and educating boys and men to view women as
valuable partners in
life, in the development of a society and in the attainment of
peace are just as important as
taking legal steps to protect women's human rights.  <p>

It is also important in order to prevent violence that non-violent
means be used to resolve
conflict between all members of society.  Breaking the cycle of
abuse will require concerted
collaboration and action between governmental and non-governmental
actors, including
educators, health-care authorities, legislators, the judiciary and
the mass media.  <p>
