Situation of detainees at Guantánamo Bay  Report of the Chairperson of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Ms. Leila  Zerrougui; the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Mr. Leandro Despouy; the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Mr. Manfred Nowak;  the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Ms. Asma Jahangir and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Mr. Paul Hunt.  A year old, but worth a look. (Of course, I'm aware that the Commission includes among its members states that have an abysmal human rights record. I would just prefer that we not be among such states.)
