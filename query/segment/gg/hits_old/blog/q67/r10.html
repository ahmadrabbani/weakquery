<!FINE TESTO><i>Wednesday 10 April 2002</i></P>
<p align="left"><i>Mr Chairman,</i></p>
<p align="left">The elimination of poverty has become an overarching dimension
of all development policy. Reducing extreme poverty by 50% by the year 2015 is
the key goal of the UN Millennium Declaration, from which the other development
targets are derived. The reduction of poverty is the focal point of the new
strategies of cooperation between the International Financial Institutions and
the heavily indebted poorest countries.</p>
<p align="left">The fight against poverty is however above all a moral
imperative, especially today due to the scandalous paradox of widespread extreme
poverty existing alongside the scientific and social progress capable of
eliminating it.</p>
<p align="left">Extreme poverty is perhaps the most pervasive and paralysing
form of violation of human rights in our world. The renewed international
commitment to fight extreme poverty must thus also have a human rights
dimension. As long as scientific progress and social development are not shared
equitably by the whole human family, the human rights ethic, centred on
equality, will not produce the desired global equity. An ethic of equality must
be integrated with an ethic of solidarity. We must build new coalitions of
solidarity to ensure that the ethic of equality becomes a reality for all.</p>
<p align="left">The first and most important contribution of a human rights
approach to extreme poverty will always be that of focussing on the dignity of
each person and recalling that being forced to live in extreme poverty is an
offence against human dignity.</p>
<p align="left">We must ensure that such a human rights approach to extreme
poverty becomes not just an ethical principle but also an operative one, in the
complex context of todays globalizing world, within which the point of
departure of different countries and economies is so different. In this context,
the emphasis on identifying best practices seems a useful road to follow.</p>
<p align="left">The Holy See would stress some underlying principles that should
inspire the human rights approach to poverty:</p>
<p align="left">A human rights approach must always focus on the person living
in poverty as a fellow human person, endowed with dignity, rights and potential.
A human rights approach cannot be satisfied with policies that treat persons
living in poverty somehow as a threat, as just potential illegal immigrants or
asylum seekers, much less as potential terrorists. We respond to the person
living in poverty, not out of fear or out of short term political or
self-interest, but in a true spirit of solidarity, fostering the common good of
the entire global community.</p>
<p align="left">The person living in poverty must not be considered an object to
be managed but as a participating subject. Men and women living in poverty
demonstrate that they have great ingenuity. Without such ingenuity they would
not survive! The focus of international intervention should be to ensure that
the genius of the poor can be focussed not just on surviving but on flourishing,
on becoming active participants in society in a way worthy of human dignity,
with hope for themselves and their families. They must have the necessary access
to formation, to credit and to judicial protection needed to achieve such
participation.</p>
<p align="left">A human rights approach to poverty elimination must focus on
those forms of discrimination and of stigma of which people living in poverty
are the special victims. Extreme poverty multiplies discrimination. Stigma
damages the self-esteem of persons living in poverty and thus weakens their
capacity to participate. One area where stigma has particular negative effects
concerns those suffering from HIV/AIDS. A human rights approach will encourage
society to embrace AIDS victims as persons who belong and can contribute.</p>
<p align="left">The current and praiseworthy initiatives in the international
fight against poverty - such as debt relief and poverty reduction strategies,
the opening of trade barriers and good governance  are destined to remain
mere strategies unless flesh is put on them through investment in people and in
the social infrastructures that will best facilitate human development. The
success of these development strategies requires the strengthening of basic
human communities that are the tissue of an active civil society and the
guarantee of what Pope John Paul II calls &quot;the subjectivity of society
[based on] structures of participation and shared responsibility&quot;<sup><a name="fnref1">(</a><a href="#fn1">1</a>)</sup>,
Following this path, a human rights approach to extreme poverty will bring its
particular contribution of integrating an ethics of equality and an ethics of
solidarity.</p>
