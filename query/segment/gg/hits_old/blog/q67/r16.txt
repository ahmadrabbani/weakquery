 Alberta Ardvark: Human Rights Commission: UN Edition

     Alberta Ardvark   Everyone has an opinion, but only some are right. Now peer reviewed.(Unlike the MSM)         Thursday, March 27, 2008   Human Rights Commission: UN Edition          Being that most of you are familiar with what is going on in Canada with some of our various Human Rights Commissions, I thought it might be of interest to take a look at what has been going on at the UN and their Human Rights Council.      The top U.N. rights body on Thursday passed a resolution proposed by Islamic countries saying it is deeply concerned about the defamation of religions and urging governments to prohibit it. Although the text refers frequently to protecting all religions, the only religion specified as being attacked is Islam, to which eight paragraphs refer.        The UN Human Rights Council adopted Thursday the resolution-- proposed by Islamic countries-- on a 21-10 vote over the opposition of Europe and Canada.  (Thank you Mr. Harper)       Speaking for the EU, Slovenian Ambassador Andrej  Logar said the 27-nation body was committed to tolerance, nondiscrimination and freedom of religion. But instead of a one-sided approach, it would be better to engage in dialogue with mutual respect. The Saudi delegation said, "Maybe Islam is one of the most obvious victims of aggressions under the pretext of freedom of expression." "It is regrettable that  there are false translations and interpretations of the freedom of expression ," the Saudi delegation told the council, adding that  no culture should incite to religious hatred by attacking sacred teachings ."    source       source . highlighting mine.    Just business as usual for those that claim to be working   at home and abroad   to protect your rights . I found this quote of interest:"It is regrettable that  there are false translations and interpretations of the freedom of expression .." Sounds like something Warren  Kinsella might say doesn't it?  -------  Edit to title (thanks Red) and my new tag line. Free speech now, spelling later!

Increasingly, the question is why Canada and the West in general are bothering with the UN.  I look forward to a day when we can withdraw from this body.

Kyoto = good Afghanistan = bad Peacekeeping = good Honoring Liberal government signed UN Drug Treaties = bad Darfur = good Peacemaking = bad Israel = Good* Confusing isn't it?
