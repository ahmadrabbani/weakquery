<p>'So near but yet so far,' has until recently been the most fitting way to
describe relations between the WTO and the Human Rights world.&nbsp; A few
minutes walk along the Geneva lakeside will take you from the WTO building to
the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), yet relations
between the two have at times been so cold that the small distance seemed
impassable.&nbsp; In 2000 a report on globalization and human rights by two
members of the UN Human Rights Sub-Commission caused a tense exchange of letters
between the WTO Secretariat and the UN Human Rights office(1) and became known
in trade circles as the 'nightmare' report for having referred to the WTO as
being a 'veritable nightmare' for developing countries.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Thaw in human rights-WTO relations<br>
<br>
</b>However, as evidenced by the constructive discussions on trade-related
issues during the annual session of the UN Commission on Human Rights
(Commission) in March-April 2003, the tension has eased considerably in the last
two years.&nbsp; Excellent reports of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, on
the human rights impacts of agriculture trade liberalization(2) and
liberalization of trade in services(3) have earned the respect of trade
officials and public interest groups alike, and shown that the human rights
perspective is a positive contribution to the debate on social impacts of trade
liberalization.&nbsp; The Commission's annual resolutions on access to
medication as a human right(4), which refer to efforts in the WTO to resolve
this issue, have further shown the WTO-relevance of human rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Commission on Human Rights' members are States: each of its 53 members is
elected by the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).&nbsp; Thus any
Commission resolution or decision is the subject of intense political
negotiation and the lowest common point of agreement is often the one that
carries the day.&nbsp; In contrast, the Commission's 'Special Rapporteurs,'
appointed to focus on particular aspects of human rights, are experts
independent from any government.&nbsp; Many of them deliver sharp and relevant
analysis of key human rights issues&nbsp; as is the case for the Special
Rapporteurs on the right to education, the right to food, the right to health
and the right to housing.(5)<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Rapporteurs flag human rights impacts of<br>
trade liberalization: education, housing and food<br>
<br>
</b>The human rights impact of international trade was a recurrent theme during
the 2003 Human Rights Commission.&nbsp; And the level of discussion reflected
the willingness and ability of many in the human rights community and the trade
policy world to seek mutually-beneficial solutions when trade liberalization
risks adversely impacting on human rights.&nbsp; For reasons of space, this
article will limit itself to references to the reports of those Commission's
Special Rapporteurs that refer directly to the WTO.(6)<br>
<br>
In her report, Katarina Tomaševski (Special Rapporteur on the right to
education) urged that education be upheld as a free public service.&nbsp; She
commented how decreasing allocations for public education was part of a
dangerous trend of privatizing and liberalizing education services, and appealed
to trade negotiators to bear in mind their obligations regarding the right to
education when defining the permitted scope of liberalization of education
services.&nbsp; She expressed concern that with privatisation, and the blurred
borderline between public and private due to the rapid expansion of sale and
purchase of education services, only poor quality education would be left for
the less well-off.&nbsp; In a question and answer session, a Norwegian delegate
raised the issue of trade liberalization in the context of the right to
education, emphasizing the need to consider human rights law as well as trade
law.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Jean Ziegler, noted that with
globalization, one government's actions can have repercussions on the right to
food of people in another country.&nbsp; He recalled that States must ensure
that their trade relations do not violate the right to food of people in other
countries, adding that States should take account of their human rights
obligations in their deliberations in multilateral organizations including the
WTO.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to housing, Miloon Kothari,
refers to the negative impacts of water privatisation on the poor and their
right to housing.&nbsp; It urges States, in keeping with their human rights
obligations, to refrain from expanding agreements such as the GATS and NAFTA
that open the way for large corporations to be sole providers of civic services
essential for the realization of the right to housing and other human rights.&nbsp;
After his mission to Mexico in 2002, Mr Kothari's stated that Mexico must
carefully examine its existing and proposed commitments under trade agreements
such as GATS, NAFTA and the FTAA, in order to ensure they do not undermine
Mexico's human rights obligations including access to basic services and the
right to adequate housing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Right to development mired in politics;<br>
right to health poised to progress<br>
<br>
</b>The human rights subject often looked to by people concerned with
international economic policy is the right to development.&nbsp; The most recent
report of the Commission's independent expert on the right to development, Arjun
Sengupta, contains much valid analysis and an interesting proposal for a 'Right
to Development&nbsp; Development Compact.'&nbsp; Yet the Commission's work on
this right is unlikely to have much impact on making international trade policy
more attentive to human rights, as right to development discussions have always
been highly politicized and are bogged down, year after year, in North-South
disagreement over issues as basic as whether or not the right to development is
a fundamental human right.<br>
<br>
It is the Commission's Special Rapporteur on the right to health, Paul Hunt, who
is poised to take the most concrete steps to address possible conflicts between
WTO-related policies and the enjoyment of human rights.&nbsp; His preliminary
report, presented in 2003, sets out a range of issues he plans to explore
further during his three-year mandate.&nbsp; He has underlined the intention to
focus on the right to health and poverty, as well as the right to health,
discrimination and stigma.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
During the Commission's debates on the right to health, China and Argentina were
amongst those who raised the question of access to medication and intellectual
property rights. China noted that drugs to deal with diseases affecting mainly
developing countries were produced in developed countries and that many
developing countries could not afford the fees for the licenses to produce these
drugs. The Chinese delegate asked how a balance could be achieved between the
protection of property rights and the right to health.&nbsp; A representative of
Argentina wondered how the Special Rapporteur intended to address the question
of the drug industry.&nbsp; Paul Hunt's report does indicate his intention to
consider this question in more detail, with reference to the implementation of
the Doha Declaration on TRIPs and public health, particularly in the lead-up to
the WTO Fifth Ministerial Conference in September in Cancún.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In his report, the Special Rapporteur also indicates his intention to look at
how services trade liberalisation under GATS could affect enjoyment of the right
to health.&nbsp; He takes a human rights perspective on another topical WTO
issue: assessment, underlining in his report that human rights requires from
States that they assess whether a new law or policy is consistent with its human
rights obligations.&nbsp; This involves analyzing the distributional impact of
laws and policies on the well-being of different groups in society, especially
the poor and vulnerable.&nbsp; He recalls that the requirement of socially
responsible impact analysis applies to States as well as other actors.<br>
<br>
The Special Rapporteur on the right to health has requested to meet with WTO
officials.&nbsp; 'I very much look forward to discussing with, and learning
from, the WTO and its member States,' Paul Hunt says.&nbsp; 'Such meetings would
provide a valuable opportunity to enhance understanding between the trade and
human rights communities and contribute constructively to the debate about
international trade and the right to health' he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Developments at this year's Human Rights Commission have shown that the human
rights movement can positively contribute to debates on trade and sustainable
development, a contribution that should be welcomed by those concerned with
economic justice worldwide.&nbsp; So as the spring sun warms up the lake in
Geneva, the park between the WTO Secretariat and the OHCHR may yet become a
common ground for discussions between the WTO and the human rights worlds rather
than a barrier separating them.<br>
