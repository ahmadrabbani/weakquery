Kissing lips, butterfly wings, an infinity symbol: the brand new Mardi Gras logo of two entwined hearts has a lot of clever design elements. But a subtle message to the Prime Minister about legalising gay marriage wasn't one of them, its creators say. ''I don't think Julia Gillard was on the designer's minds much while they worked on this,'' joked Greg Logan, from advertising agency Moon, which ran the rebranding of Mardi Gras.

Sydney's 35-year-old Mardi Gras was re-launched today, with a new name, a new logo, and a new message about inclusivity that organisers acknowledged might alienate some of their traditional supporters. ''We fought for this day, the day we could embrace the wider community and be inclusive,'' Mardi Gras Chair Peter Urmson said. Gone is the suffix ''gay and lesbian'' from the March event, which will now be simply Sydney Mardi Gras; gone too is the ''alphabet soup'' of GLBTQI from the name. While insisting that the heart of the not-for-profit which stages the annual Mardi Gras parade remained the gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer, transgender and intersex community, Mr Urmson said the organisation was issuing an invitation to any and all comers who celebrate diversity and ''the right to be''. ''We would love to see people who share our values, but who never thought they would be in the Parade to approach us and share their ideas,'' Mr Urmson said. ''Our hope with this change is to turn Sydney Mardi Gras into an even bigger civic event - right up there with Rio and the world's other great carnivals - to be enjoyed by everyone, but always remembered as being a gift to the city from its gay and lesbian community.'' After Mardi Gras went into administration nine years ago, it has been a bumpy ride. A venue booking error two years ago separated the parade from the after-party by a week, generating a massive $600,000 annual loss on the books. Things improved last year but the organisation was still $130,000 in the red, but Mr Urmson said it was on track to be back in the black this year. But he admitted the crisis had triggered the reinvention, which followed an extensive community consultation process with ''everyone from '78ers to kids still at school'', Mr Logan said. The 2012 Mardi Gras after party will be headlined by US drag star RuPaul, UK cabaret act the Dame Edna Experience and Australian dance group Sneaky Sound System; along with a festival season at the Opera House Studio from 12 February until March 4.
