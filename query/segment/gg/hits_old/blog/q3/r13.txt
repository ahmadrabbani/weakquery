He seemed confident and relaxed, and I thought the moments when he stepped out of the role of speechmaker and spoke in a more conversational tone were especially effective. And those quick humorous asides—like the line about it being clear that he didn’t do health-care reform for the political benefit—were winning.  Substantively, there was nothing especially surprising in the speech—with the exception, perhaps, of the call to repeal “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” But the lack of surprise was, in a sense, a good thing, since it suggested that Obama was not panicking as a result of Scott Brown’s victory. And the major initiatives he called for make a great deal of sense, including most importantly an expanded jobs program and a hiring tax credit. The proposal to use bailout money to fund $30 billion in lending to small businesses also seemed like a political winner that would also be economically useful, albeit on a small scale. The call for massive investments in new nuclear energy plants was also intriguing. It brought both sides of the aisle to their feet, but investing in nukes has been a hard sell politically since the nineteen-seventies, both for the obvious reason and because their upfront costs are immense. It’ll be interesting to see if anything comes of that idea. What I liked best about the speech, though, was the rhetorical tone that Obama struck. It was not a memorable speech in terms of the language, but it was forthright and seemed not at all defensive. It did a good job of balancing partisan advocacy with the kind of common-ground rhetoric that comes naturally to Obama. Most important, it placed jobs at the heart of the speech, which is where they belong, both politically and in terms of policy. And it was good to see Obama do this without being obviously or stridently populist. After the speech, a couple of pundits described Obama’s opening reference to hating the bank bailout as a call to arms, but it didn’t come off like that at all. Instead, it seemed like a honest statement of fact: everyone hates the bailouts, but they had to be done. And what followed was right on point: what matters now is not vengeance, but repayment (the bank tax) and substantive reform, so that the bailouts don’t happen again. This felt like Obama at its best: acknowledging people’s anger and the justice of it, but always drawing the discussion back to rational, pragmatic grounds.  The speech was too long, though.
