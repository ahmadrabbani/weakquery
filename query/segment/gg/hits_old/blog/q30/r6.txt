 theblogprof: Rep Jim Moran (D-VA): Offshore Drilling Could Interfere With SEAL Training

      skip to main  |  skip to sidebar  theblogprof   A blog about politics, faith, science and technology, physical fitness, and life.         Sunday, May 8, 2011   Rep Jim Moran (D-VA): Offshore Drilling Could Interfere With SEAL Training   For those not regular readers here, or not familiar with Moran, I will note that Moran recently was a part of a group of Dems that accused the GOP of trying to kill them with styrofoam cups , said that the big red wave of 2010 was  due to voter racism , is against photo ID for voting but  demanded photo ID at his town hall ,  declared the war in Afghanistan lost  and claimed that being in the military is  not public service . This anti-military loon also had this episode of late: Video of Rep. Jim Moran (D-VA) Shouting Down Disabled Vet at Town Hall; ‘Sit Down or Leave’ . So yeah - the guy is a weapons-grade moonbat. Ironically, for a guy that is openly anti-military, he's using the military to go after a more important priority - crushing our economy by continuing to skyrocket gas prices, ostensibly for our own good. From ARL Now:  Moran: Offshore Drilling Could Interfere With SEAL Training This afternoon the House of Representatives passed a bill that would permit oil drilling off the coast of Virginia.  On the House floor today, Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.) offered his support for an amendment that would have strengthened provisions in the bill that prohibit drilling in an area that would cause “unreasonable conflict” with naval operations  . The amendment failed, and the bill passed 266-149. “The proposed lease sale would interfere with U.S. Navy operations and Virginia’s commercial fishery and tourism industries,” Moran said in a statement. “National Security and economic growth should trump lining the pockets of big oil executives.” Moran added that the drilling could interfere with the training of Virginia Beach-based Navy SEAL Team Six, the elite squad that killed Osama bin Laden. Never let a crisis go to waste. Perhaps the voters of Virginia will have something to say to Moran early November 2012 in trying to quash a jobs providing vote for the state and relief at the pump.
