Gather Real Estate Business Intelligence Data from Multiple Systems  Large corporations have many systems that help run their operations. These systems are used to  schedule resources , manage space, detect utilization,  control energy consumption , and  manage equipment . While each of these systems provides a need, the data they contain or produce must be converted in such a way that it can be easily understood.

This allows them to gain a thorough insight to how their rooms and resources are being used.

What is needed is analysis and trending information presented in a format that is easily interpreted and actionable. PeopleCube’s  workplace business intelligence solutions collect utilization data in real-time and present it through innovative  interactive visualization dashboards . These real estate business intelligence visualizations enable you to dig down into your data to discover exactly how your real estate and assets are being used.
