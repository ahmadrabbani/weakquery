[EJBIR1002CS] – ElegantJ BI Business Intelligence Implementation for a Non-for-Profit organization Working in USA          A non-profit organization – a leader in promoting urban sustainability in USA – has the mandate to monitor and recommend efficient energy and resource consumption by corporate entities across USA. The client was using spreadsheets to capture diverse data related to unit consumption, costs, research and analytics of Energy Usage Intensity for both Heating Degree Days & Cooling Degree Days, and it was suffering from the drawbacks of using multiple non-standard spreadsheets. The key challenge of the company was to improve quality of data, time required to collect & validate data, publish graphs & analysis with periodic time series, and perform other ad hoc queries & complex analysis. Client also wanted a BI solution that is simple to use, accessible from web, and requires minimal human resources to perform these periodic tasks. ElegantJ BI Business Intelligence solution deployed with customized ETL solution has offered web based, simple to use, error-free analytic system to client, in short time span and small budget. Research coordinators at client side, now have complete picture of the energy usage patterns and trends in hours rather than days, and they spend more time doing other ad hoc research and data mining, rather than collecting, consolidating and validating data from large number of spreadsheets received from member organizations every month. This initiative is helping Client maintain its leadership position for a good cause of promoting sustainable urban communities in USA.
