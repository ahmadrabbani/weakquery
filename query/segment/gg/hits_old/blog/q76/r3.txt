China's …    A baby boy sitting in a luxury toy car, riding next to his family along a street …      As the world's population hits the seven billion mark, straining the earth's resources, …    Without the birth limits, which no other country applies as rigorously or on such …      China's one-child policy has prevented almost half a billion births but has turned into a demographic time bomb as the  population ages , storing up huge economic and social problems for the country. As the world's  population hits the seven billion mark, straining the earth's resources, China can claim to have curbed its birth rate to around 1.5 children per woman since the policy was introduced in 1979. Without the birth limits, which no other country applies as rigorously or on such a scale, the world's most populous nation would have hundreds of millions more mouths to feed than the 1.34 billion it has now. But from modern cities to remote villages, its implementation has involved abuses from mass sterilisation to abortions as late as eight months into the pregnancy. Baby girls have also been abandoned and killed. Couples who defy the rule can face fines amounting to several years' salary, have access to social services cut and even go to prison. Their so-called "black children" have no legal status in China. Ethnic minorities and farmers whose first child is a girl are exempt from the restriction and in some areas, couples where both parents are only children are also allowed to have a second baby. But three decades on, demographers, sociologists and economists are warning of a looming crisis as China becomes the only developing country in the world to face growing old before it grows rich. China's crisis is approaching "incomparably faster" than in Europe, where fertility has fallen very gradually over the last century, Paris-based demographer Christophe Guilmoto told AFP. In the next five years the number of people in China over 60 will jump from 178 million to 221 million -- 13.3 percent to 16 percent of the population -- according to the People's Daily Online By 2050, a quarter of China's population will be over 65, the Commission for Population and Family Planning said, compared to just nine percent today. Already, half of China's over-60s live alone, a situation unthinkable before, when four generations would live under one roof. The upside-down pyramid -- whereby a single child shoulders responsibility for two parents and four grandparents -- is a major headache for the government, particularly as unemployment rises, forcing more and more people to migrate to cities for work. Liang Zhongtang, a demographer involved in family planning, said the pressure would grow as Chinese born between 1962 and 1972 retire. "Nearly 30 million babies were born each year during that period, compared to six or seven million each year right now, you can imagine how big the burden on the government will be," he said. China already lacks medical facilities for the elderly, retirement homes and qualified health care workers. The government plans to double the number of beds in specialised institutions to six million by 2015, but that only covers the existing shortfall. China has barely begun to put in place a universal social security and retirement system, and over two-thirds of the rural population does not have a pension. So, should China end, or at least relax its one-child rule? "Of course!" said He Yafu, a Chinese demographer. "The reproductive right is a human right, whether and how many children a couple want to have has nothing to do with the government. "Even if China relaxes the one-child policy, I believe there won't be many couples wanting too many children", He told AFP, as middle-class couples around the world opt increasingly for smaller families. Guilmoto is hopeful that fertility might rise in the future, even if "this is very uncertain when we look at the most advanced regions where it comes close to one child per woman". Women are increasingly deciding against having children at all, opting instead to pursue careers and enjoy their growing material wealth. But the southern province of Guangdong -- the engine of China's economy with its 104 million residents -- this month decided against relaxing the policy. China's most populous province ruled there would be "no major adjustments" to the policy in the next five years, said Zhang Feng, head of the Population and Family Planning Commission.      @yahoonews on Twitter, become a fan on  Facebook         Editors' Picks    story Opinion: Shame on Penn State     slideshow Cain accuser comes forward     slideshow Smokin' Joe Frazier 1944-2011     slideshow Dr. Conrad Murray found guilty     slideshow Glamour Women of the Year awards     slideshow Occupy Philly wedding      Explore Related Content 1 - 4 of 12   prev      next        Play Video  Cash-Strapped Europe Looks to  China  …       China to maintain strict 'one child' …  China , the world's most populous country with more than 1.3 billion people, will …   Full Story » China to maintain strict 'one child' policy    AFP       Play Video   China launches spacecraft      India facing twin epidemic time bomb, …  India is facing a twin epidemic of diabetes and high blood pressure, doctors …   Full Story » India facing twin epidemic time bomb, say doctors    AFP           Top Stories »   Berlusconi to resign after parliament OKs reforms    Remake America: Income Inequality    Yahoo! and ABC News interview Herman Cain    Report: Penn State preparing to oust Joe Paterno    Iran worked on nuclear bomb design: IAEA    Another appeals court upholds Obama health-care law    Election Day: Personhood, collective bargaining dominate ballots        Most Popular  Fourth accuser urges Herman Cain to ‘come clean’ about harassment   Michelle & Jim Bob Duggar Expecting 20th Child   Pastor’s corporal punishment advice scrutinized after child deaths   Sarkozy tells Obama Netanyahu is a "liar"   New formula would reduce Social Security increases   Correcting the ‘fairy tale’: A SEAL’s account of how Osama bin Laden really died           Today on Yahoo!  1 - 4 of 43   prev      next        'Liar' mic gaffe may haunt Sarkozy, Obama       Should this NFL celebration be legal?

Just the Facts    •    Jonesboro, United States     •    2 hours ago   this problem with no one to care for the old is only for one generation. The problem will fix itself. I think 1 child policy is something that more 3rd world countries should impliment. The US can not afford to send all of our money/aid to these countries! We now have to take care of our own welfare kids (which has multiplied beyond belief) largely due to others coming here from the 3rd world and have 5-6 kids all now on the system. this is a large portion of our economic failures and school system failures.. Sad but true...           Annette Morrison    about a week ago   This problem is not unique to China. Most indulstrialized nations are having far fewer children and there are fewer children to take care of their elders. This is happening in the US, Japan, Italy, and other nations.           Robert    about a week ago   Baby girls have also been abandoned and killed in India with the same problems.           Mike Mcardle    about a week ago   guess there will be alot of gay marriage.           dude with opinions    •    Philadelphia, United States     •    about a week ago   Couldn't they just cash in the money WE the USA owe them? A trillion dollars in China can take care of a lot of retired Chinese with out going into debt!           OH NO    about a week ago   Who do i have to kill to get rid of this god dam pop up?           BonnieN    •    Bozeman, United States     •    about a week ago   What happens in the event of twins?           Paula    about a week ago   This article doesn't mention that more couples are opting to have girls instead of boys because they find that girls will more likely take care of the parents in their old age. Woman will allow the parents to live with her and her family. Another reason the switch in sex preference is that when having a boy, the tradition is to provide a house and other things for him to have when he gets married, however, a lot of parents are finding it difficult to provide this.  There are plenty of women in China still, the article also failed to mention that woman are becoming more selective than in the past in choosing a mate. Most feel that they don't have to settle anymore.           Brad    •    Hartford, United States     •    about a week ago   That parents could kill or abaon a daughter tells us much about these people           Larry    about a week ago   And we pay women to have illegitimate kids by the dozens.           Lodo Grdzak    about a week ago   Life is trouble. There's always going to be some problem vexing the human race. But 7 billion people and growing is the biggest problem of all. We already see how there's not enough work for the people we've got. And technology continues to lessen the need for human labor. Texas doesn't have enough water for its people, and we don't even consider population a problem yet here in the U.S. The real problem in the world is poverty. When you dont have money, you have a bunch of kids. Partially because you need them for social security, partially because poor people are ignorant in regards to birth control, and partially because...what else is there to do or enjoy when you don't have anything? But if China didn't have that one child policy--man! the world would really be screwed.           Jon    about a week ago   With all of their money The old in China can hire the rest of the world to take care of them in their old age.           Jim_vierling    •    Holt, United States     •    about a week ago   A species that reproduces until such time that it has to move to new areas to find new resources to feed the continually growing population.  A species that uses up all the resources of the area it inhabits indiscriminately so that it has to move to new areas to get more resources. A species that brings diseases and parasites with it as it moves into new areas. A species that will kill the inhabitants of the area so that they can claim the resources in the area for themselves.  A species that will continue to breed even though all resources have been used up and will turn against other members of the species in order to take their resources. At this point, is the species above humans or cockroaches?           Natasha W.    about a week ago   "Right to reproduce?" Are you kidding me? Irresponsible breeding has caused so many problems for the world... Ugh. It's cruel to have children you can't support, or who you know will harbour genetic defects. This is why I refuse to pass on my genes. If only more people were educated and better able to understand what hell their large families create.           rfw    about a week ago   I see China's population problems as an economic boom for the US. The US should be planting as much crops as it could, raise enough cattle to feed the world and producing food products for the free market. China is going to need food and there is no better place than buy if from the US. US food can become like oil is to the world.           TEN-OF-WANDS    about a week ago   This is the only nation on the planet which has addressed, however clumsily, the one most critical issue facing humanity: overpopulation.           JustAnotherBrickIntheWall    •    Chicago, United States     •    about a week ago   If the only solution is growth of the human population for economic stability, that's unsustainable.           KendraB    about a week ago   someone asked what happens in the event of twins.anyone know??because now my curiousity is killing me!!               •    Boise, United States     •    about a week ago   If anyone has a science background they would understand the concept of carrying capacity. While we are not near the planet's carrying capacity, having more people would only bring us closer to this limit, which if we get closer and closer more problems will arise.          More     Post a comment     [ [ [['Dekraai', 10]], 'http://news.yahoo.com/photos/mourners-remember-seal-beach-shooting-victims-1318620627-slideshow/', 'Click image to see more photos', 'http://l.yimg.com/a/p/us/news/editorial/3/2c/32c8e92d889f42edb719cb5257afdf4e.jpeg', '461', ' ', 'Reuters/Lori Shepler', ], [ [['iPhone 4SXXXXXXX', 11]], 'http://news.yahoo.com/photos/thousands-line-up-for-apple-s-iphone-4s-1318602841-slideshow/', 'Click image to see more photos', 'http://l.yimg.com/a/p/us/news/editorial/f/4f/f4f15e8f6f323f5386dc9fdf9e15dca8.jpeg', '500', ' ', 'AP/Kirsty Wigglesworth', ] ]  [ [ [['xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', 11]], '27013743', '0' ], [ [['keyword', 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999]], 'videoID', '1', 'overwrite-pre-description', 'overwrite-link-string', 'overwrite-link-url' ] ]     You on Yahoo!
