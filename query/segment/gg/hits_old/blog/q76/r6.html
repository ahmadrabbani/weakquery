<UL>I had utterly lost control. When the doctor 
began to suction roughly at the inside of my uterus, I 
could not hold back my tears. The physical pain was 
nothing compared to my cesarean section, but it felt as 
though my heart were being torn into a thousand 
pieces. -- Steven Mosher, <i>A Mother's Ordeal</i>, 
206. </UL><P>

These were the bitter words of Chi An, a Chinese woman who was 
forced to abort her second child. The chilling story in <i></i>, by 
Steven Mosher, revolves around her struggle against all odds to 
have more than one baby. Not only was she a victim of China's one-
child policy, she was a perpetrator.<p>

	The policy started in 1957 when Chairman Mao Tsetung gave 
a speech on "Contradiction," stating that the "Chinese should begin 
to control their fertility." To have a child, the couple must apply 
for a birth quota, and if it was granted, they must have the baby 
within a year. If these standards were not met, another 
application had to be submitted the following year (Mosher, 169). 
Programs were also introduced to ensure a couple could have no 
more than two children, and they must be at least four years apart 
(Mosher, vii). Then women were recommended to have one child, 
and pregnant mothers were forced to have abortions.<P>

	In <i>A Mother's Ordeal</i>, Chi An underwent such a 
gruesome experience. After giving birth to a son, she wanted a 
girl. At that time she was still able to apply for a birth quota in 
four years for her second child. When an official asked her to 
choose a method of birth control, she said that the pill would 
reduce her milk supply and an IUD would aggravate the infection in 
her uterus. As a result she became pregnant when her son was only 
seven months old and the fetus had to be aborted. Because of Chi 
An's infection, the doctor concluded that an abortion could be 
potentially dangerous to her. Such a medical decision was 
unacceptable to the official, who screamed: "[I]f you won't do it . . . 
then find us a doctor who will" (Mosher, 206). The physician did as 
he was told.<P>

	The one-child policy was promoted through propaganda 
(Winberg Chai, <i>New Politics of Communist China</i>, 169). The 
Chinese were forced to attend meetings which gave them 
"informational material describing the advantages of abortion and 
sterilization, and the use of condoms, vaginal diaphragms, 
chemical solution, and occasionally, the rhythm method" (Chai, 
170). Other strategies at these meetings were to show films on 
birth control and to pass out samples of "contraceptive appliances 
for people to inspect" (Chai, 170). When a woman was discovered 
to be pregnant with a second child, a representative would tell her 
to "have an abortion immediately," and she would "receive a cash 
bonus and a week off work" (Mosher, 264). If the woman refused to 
comply, she would be dealt with according to "local laws and 
regulations," says the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for 
Human Rights 
(http://www.christusrex.org/wwwl/sds/hr_facts.html).  In 
Mosher's book, the regulation was to lock up the woman in a cell 
while the population control workers continued to persuade her to 
have an abortion. This could last right up to the actual birth of a 
baby. Should this happen, the child would be aborted during the 
delivery (Mosher, 169, 284).<p>

	There is not a word strong enough to describe the brutality 
of a late-term abortion. The graphic details given by Mosher cast a 
chill over the entire book. Doctors would "induce premature labor," 
says Chi An, who is a trained nurse. "Then, after the cervix had 
dilated and the crown of the baby's head was exposed, he would 
inject pure formaldehyde into the fetal brain through the fontanel, 
or soft spot." If the cervix did not dilate fully, the doctor would 
"reach in with forceps and crush the baby's skull" (Mosher, 255). In 
China a late-term abortion was considered legal as long as the 
baby was "partly in the womb" (Mosher, 255).<p>
	Because of the one-child policy, female infanticide was 
common in China's villages where people preferred a son because 
he "would stay by their sides forever, carrying on with the farm 
work after they retired, looking after them in their old age" 
(Mosher, 229). A couple in the home village of Chi An's husband, 
for example, planned to bury their daughter alive, but the child 
tearfully pleaded for her life, by promising to never desert her 
parents. Ignoring her plea, the father smacked his shovel into her 
head and split her skull open. The parents ended up feeling so 
guilty that they turned themselves in (Mosher, 231).<p>

	Some readers question if Mosher's sources are creditable and 
whether he has exaggerated the details. At times Chi An does 
seem a gifted taleteller, endlessly spinning yarns from her 
memories of a country that has disallowed her to have a second 
child. Others feel that China, which staggers under a population of 
1.2 billion, needs a zero percent growth rate. I agree, but the way 
the one-child policy is administered is inhumane, with no respect 
for the sanctity of human life and the rights of an individual. It is 
not fair to put a limitation on the number of children a woman is 
allowed to have.<p>
 
	After her own abortion, Chi An was asked to attend one of 
those meetings that marked the beginnings of the one-child policy. 
The women who agreed to sign an agreement to be sterilized 
received a cash bonus. Chi An was among those who refused, but 
she finally relented when the academic career of her husband, Wei 
Xin, was contingent upon her consent. He had applied to further his 
study in mechanical engineering in the United States, and her 
choice to bear another child would jeopardize his chance of being 
accepted.<p>

	After Wei Xin left for the U.S., Chi An found a job in her field 
of nursing. The only catch was that she would be part of the 
population control committee. Chi An seemed to have changed her 
mind, and cherished the one-child policy as a much-needed 
strategy for her country's economic prosperity. Secretly she felt 
that if she could not have any more children, then no one else 
should. Her job was to convince mothers who were found pregnant 
to have an abortion. She did her job well and was eventually 
promoted to a higher position, which involved assisting 
abortions.<p>

	Finally Wei Xin wrote Chi An, asking her and their son to join 
him in America. She left China once she received permission to do 
so; her only warning was she could not get pregnant in the U.S. She 
also had to have an X-ray to see if her IUD was still in place. When 
she was with her husband in America, she somehow became 
pregnant despite her IUD. She wrote back to the authorities to see 
what would happen if she returned with a second child. Chi An and 
her husband received threats from the population control workers. 
The couple then turned to Steven Mosher for help and later became 
American citizens. Chi An gave birth to a girl named Mei, which 
means America in Chinese, "the land of her birth" (Mosher, 335).<p>

	Some readers accuse Chi An of being manipulating and 
selfish. That seems an odd charge laid against a woman who did 
not even have the freedom of speech. She was unable to express 
her desire for having a daughter, and her only means of holding on 
her dream was by dodging the authorities. Her pregnancy in 
America was totally accidental. I believe that her decision to keep 
Mei was subconsciously related to her sense of guilt from her 
first abortion.<p>

	Mosher, however, neglects to state the fact that the one-
child policy is for the people of China's well-being. I just wish 
that there were another solution. The policy still exists in China 
today. "The population is currently growing at the rate of about 
two percent per year, but the official policy is to try to reduce it 
to one percent per year and eventually to zero population growth," 
according to one source published more than two decades ago (Gil 
Loescher and Ann D. Loescher, <i>The Chinese Way: Life in the 
People's Republic of China </i>,143). Recent statistics show that 
the rate has been reduced to one percent -- twelve million -- 
which is still larger than the population in the entire province of 
Ontario (10,928,000 in 1994). Meanwhile the debate about national 
obligation and individual freedom continues as China struggles to 
improve the standard of living for its enormous 
population.<p><BR><BR>
