This is no gaffe. The White House endorses this policy. Just ask the president's science adviser. We are used to the "mouth that roared" putting his foot in it. But Vice President Joe Biden's remarks at Sichuan University in China clearly embrace the progressive belief that people are a plague on the Earth — not its greatest resource. "Your policy has been one which I fully understand — I'm not second-guessing — of one child per family. The result being that you're in a position where one wage earner will be taking care of four retired people. Not sustainable," Biden opined, embracing entitlement reform, Beijing-style. Does Biden believe a government should be able to dictate to its people not only the number of children they have, but the sex? Is this how government deals with the problem of too many retirees and too few workers? After all, the vice president said of dealing with the problem of debt and budgets, "maybe we can learn together from how we can do that." "Really, Mr. Vice President? You're not second-guessing a policy that has resulted in untold numbers of forced abortions, forced sterilizations, outrageous fines or even jail time for families that dare to defy the law, and a gender imbalance crisis?" the Susan B. Anthony List said on its blog. Besides helping to balance China's budget, Beijing's one-child policy helps cut those nasty C02 emissions. Amnesty International reports that Chinese authorities forcibly sterilized 10,000 people in one city in Guangdong Province just last year. They will not have "unnecessary" children to burden Chinese society.  China's one-child policy, instituted by the Communist government in the late 1970s to stem rising population, compels couples in urban areas to have just one child and limits couples in rural areas to two children if the first child is a girl — since girls are seen as having lesser value than boys in some parts of the Asian nation. This administration supports draconian actions to fight climate change. In 2007, at climate change talks in Vienna, Su Wei, a senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official, boasted that China's one-child policy had reduced China's population at that point by some 300 million human beings, roughly equal to the U.S. population. Avoiding those 300 million births "means we averted 1.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide in 2005," based on average world per capital emissions of 4.2 tons, he said.

China has created life style enhancement programs for the general public; hence, having two children in one family disqualify that family from some of the programs. There's no penalty imposed! People of China understands the population problem in their country therefore majority of them agree and comply with the government's request.
