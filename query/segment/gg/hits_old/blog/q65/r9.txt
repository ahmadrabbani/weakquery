This was a side trip on his visit through Southside Virginia on Thursday, April 12, where he was in the area to discuss the need for a new U.S. energy policy. The successful collaborative effort of federal, state and local entities which was headlined by then Governor Warner, U.S. Senator John W. Warner and  Luna CEO Kent Murphy greets former Governor Mark Warner on his tour of the Luna nanoWorks facility in Danville, Va.   Congressman Virgil Goode, announced the $6.4 million investment to locate Luna�s nanomanufacturing facility in the City of Danville�s Tobacco Warehouse District for the research and development of new military and commercial applications. The Luna nanoWorks project, which held the initial focus on being one of the key catalytic components in transforming the Southside economy of Virginia by promoting a high-technology image for the region and bringing in �new economy� jobs, is accomplishing its mission. "In the past three years, we�ve been able to announce over 6,000 new jobs for the region," Warner said, adding many of these positions have been in the technology field. Warner also mentioned his belief that alternative energy is quickly becoming one of the next big technology focus areas and noted the millions of research and investment dollars that are being spent on it.
