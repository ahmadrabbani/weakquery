Bush's Texas ranch. Sheehan's son,    Casey   , served in Iraq with the U.S. Army, losing his life on April 4, 2004.  On June 18, 2004, President Bush met with Cindy Sheehan and other parents who had lost sons or daughters in the war. This meeting took place at Fort Lewis, an Army base near Tacoma, Washington. After Casey's death, Cindy Sheehan co-founded Gold Star Families for Peace, and began making anti-war and anti-Bush speeches.  On August 6, 2005, Sheehan began a demonstration outside President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, attracting major media coverage and sparking nation-wide discussion over her role, and the continued war in Iraq.  After her initial demonstration in Crawford, Texas ended, Sheehan participated in other protests around the nation and gave speeches against the war and against President Bush.  In the summer of 2006, Cindy Sheehan used some of the money she received from her son's death to purchase land in Crawford, Texas. She did this in order to facilitate more anti-war and anti-Bush protests and demonstrations.  In July, 2007, Sheehan demanded that the Democrats in Congress impeach Bush and Cheney and remove the troops from Iraq, or she would launch an election campaign against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.  On August 9, 2007, Cindy Sheehan announced her intention to run as an independent candidate for Congress against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Sheehan officially opened her campaign headquarters in San Francisco on December 8, 2007. Cindy Sheehan began a petition drive to collect 10,198 valid signatures, the requirement for her to get on the ballot as an independent candidate for U.S. House. On August 8, 2008, Sheehan officially qualified as a candidate on the ballot.
