      skip to main  |  skip to sidebar  SACRAMENTO PROGRESSIVE ALLIANCE   Official blog of the Sacramento Progressive Alliance, the Central Valley's largest grassroots progressive organization with more than 5,000 members         Monday, October 17, 2011   Cindy Sheehan arrested in Sacramento protest       The Associated Press  PUBLISHED SUNDAY, OCT. 16, 2011  SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan was one of 19 demonstrators arrested during an Occupy Wall Street protest in Sacramento early Sunday. Police told The Sacramento Bee that the 53-year-old Sheehan was booked into Sacramento County Jail around 3:15 a.m. on suspicion of unlawful assembly and failing to follow police orders to disburse.  Police spokeswoman Laura Peck says the 18 other demonstrators were also arrested for unlawful assembly.    Peck says because the charge is a misdemeanor, those arrested would likely be released and ordered to appear in court within a few days.  T  he Bee reports that there have been 58 arrests at the park across from City Hall where protesters have been gathering since Oct. 6.
