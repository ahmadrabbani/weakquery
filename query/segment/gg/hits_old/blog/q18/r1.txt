During the summer of 2005, supporters of Cindy Sheehan at what became to be known as   Camp Casey  and with the support of CodePINK decided to move to Crawford, TX and began a long fast until President Bush agreed to a meeting with Cindy Sheehan... again. That's right... a second time. What few will tell you is that President Bush actually met with Casey's mother and father, Cindy and Patrick Sheehan, earlier concerning their son. Shortly after her son's death in Iraq, Sheehan said she had reservations about the war. She was very pleased that President Bush invited her and her husband to a face-to-face meeting. After the meeting, Patrick said,  "We have a lot of respect for the office of the president, and I have a new respect for him because he was sincere and he didn't have to take the time to meet with us."  Cindy added,  "I now know he's sincere about wanting freedom for the Iraqis, I know he's sorry and feels some pain for our loss. And I know he's a man of faith."  Everyone seems to forget about that meeting.     Some research about Casey Sheehan revealed that contrary to being tricked by military recruiters, Casey Sheehan had actually re-enlisted in the U.S. Army voluntarily when he was 24-years-old, after serving his first hitch successfully. Casey Sheehan was in fact a hero who received a Bronze Star for actions beyond the call of duty. He was attached as a mechanic to the artillery division of the 1   st   U.S. Cavalry in Iraq. A convoy of soldiers from Casey's unit was under attack in Sadr City by insurgents when Casey volunteered to join a rapid rescue force to get them out. His sergeant told him he did not have to go into combat, because he was a mechanic and not an infantryman.  "I go where my chief goes." Casey said. Casey Sheehan, 24, of Vacaville, CA, died in Iraq, on April 4, 2004. He was tragically killed during the rescue attempt when his unit was attacked with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire. And who was the source for this story? Casey's mother, Cindy Sheehan. Cindy Sheehan would have more credibility if she had not changed her story about her meeting with President Bush. Nothing but positive words and appreciation after her    FIRST   meeting with the President. Now she has done a 180 degree turn. She has allied herself with the fringe-element of the anti-war Left-Wing, the Radical Muslim groups that are clearly anti-American, and with White Supremacists/Nazi groups that share her extreme anti-Semitic views.  Cindy Sheehan wants to meet with President Bush again to ask, "What is the noble cause for which my son died in Iraq?"    Here is the answer. The noble cause was the attempted rescue of a convoy of soldiers from his unit. And to his honor, Casey Sheehan volunteered to join the rescue force. Casey Sheehan was killed when his unit was attacked with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire.     A government that encourages impunity, tortures and kills its own citizens, condones rapes against women and commits atrocities against its own people should never be allowed to exist by any civilized people.    What Happened to the Big Hunger Strike? Camp Casey was the site of the most uncommitted demonstration of  'fasting' in the history of the world. Even the media failed to mention how much weight was lost by the participants. And the reason is because this  'fasting' was not real by any stretch of the imagination. No one lost any weight. Very unusual for a any kind of hunger strike. This event was touted far and wide by the media for a few days. It really ended up as being nothing more than not eating between meals.   THAT IS NOT FASTING!!!   Many volunteered to fast to support Cindy until President Bush would agree to meet with her a second time. Below is the list of volunteers along with the limitations of their commitment to the  'fasting' . Many have forgotten about this protest, but we will not.

The latest entrants in the saga of Cindy Sheehan vs. President Bush are white supremacists. On 27 August 2005, they joined Cindy Sheehan and the rally in Crawford, Texas. Members of   Stormfront.org  are tossing their figurative hoods into the mix. They invited supporters to come to Camp Casey to  "let the world know that white patriots were first and loudest to protest this war for Israel."  That raises a good question. Who is allied with Cindy Sheehan and CodePINK? Here are some of the many supporters. Take note of the level of anti-Semitism of these groups.  Aljazeera    ARISSA    Communist Party USA    David Duke    Institute for Anarchists Studies    Institute for Social Ecology    International Socialist Organization (ISO)    Libertarian National Socialist Green Party    MoveOn.org    National Socialist Movement    Northeastern Federation of Anarchist Communists    Prison Activist Resource Center   RTF Direct Action Network   Ruckus Society    San Diego Coalition of Peace and Justice    Socialist Party USA    Stormfront.org    Student Direct Action Coalition    Troops Out Now!    World War 4 Report   Take a good look at this list. Are any of these groups even remotely Pro-American? Cindy Sheehan and her followers call America a  'Fascist State' yet they maintain very close ties to the above Fascist related groups. These people are so radical, yet they make up the mainstream of the Left-Wing.  These groups are truly dangerous. They, and the people associated with them, are not at all  "Supporting the Troops" in any way, shape, or form. Nor would the Troops want to associate themselves with any of these groups. That is another way to look at it. Would the soldiers that these groups say they so strongly support want anything to do with them. Of course not. The dedicated professionals serving in the U.S. military would want nothing to do with these people. It is obvious that she has no idea what a Fascist Government really is. She has aligns herself with Radical Islam and White Supremacists.   Her supporters are David Duke and the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan!  Where is the moral outrage? This proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Left-Wing is a serious threat to America! It makes you wonder what side she would have been on in World War II. The enemies of America and Israel love Cindy Sheehan. And it is no wonder. She has spoken ill of America and Israel. Calling this war   "a war for a Jewish cabal.  Is it any wonder that Cindy Sheehan has such hatred toward America and Israel? She exudes nothing but Anti-Semitic thoughts and ideas. She does not like the American military, but she does seem to be fond of the insurgents that are killing our soldiers. Cindy Sheehan calls our soldiers  "Killers" and  "Occupation Forces" , but then claims to support them completely. At virtually every peace protest that Cindy Sheehan attends, there are numerous tables with like-minded people that are passing out Socialist and Marxist literature. This is not done behind her back. She is very aware of it. These are her new friends. These are her supporters. These are the people with whom she has close associations. The   Socialist and Marxist doctrine  is the basis of her ideals and convictions.      www.youtube.com/v/NFqWLPyCt_0      Cindy Sheehan is doing nothing but trying to gain fame and recognition off of the dead bodies of U.S. servicemen. This is nothing but exploitation of soldiers that have paid the ultimate price for Freedom. The more Americans that are killed, the more they have to celebrate. For each soldier that is killed, Cindy Sheehan uses that death to empower Cindy Sheehan. What a selfish and self-centered existence these people lead.    Here we see Cindy Sheehan getting ready to commit a fraud on the American public. Life at Camp Casey is tough. How does she find the energy to get through the day?      The above photo is what they want you to see. A candid moment of Cindy Sheehan grieving. A very private moment among a few close friends and supporters.      This is the photo they did NOT want you to see.    Do you think she knew the cameras were there? What we have here is a staged event. Proof that Cindy Sheehan being disingenuous. Everything this woman does in public is choreographed and staged. The tears, the grieving, the painful emotions. It is all faked. Cindy Sheehan has become quite an accomplished actress. She is exploiting the death of her son in order to advance her own selfish agenda. There is probably a great book deal and maybe even a made-for-TV-movie on   Lifetime (Television geared to women)  in the near future. Check your local listings.         What is Cindy Sheehan so happy about? She seems to be enjoying her attempts to divide America. She also seems to like the attention.    This glittering jewel of Liberalism, Cindy Sheehan is blaming everyone else for her son's death except for those that actually killed him. Casey Sheehan volunteered and served with honor as a soldier, but his mother is doing everything to remove this honor from his name. This is why these people should never be in a position of authority responsible for defending America.     Cindy Sheehan received the key to the city of Cambridge yesterday afternoon from the vice mayor, Majorie Decker.    You would think that her son had been found alive. But is seems this meaningless piece of metal earned by the exploitation of an American soldier's death is what really makes her happy.    It is easy to see that Cindy Sheehan has taken the death of her son and has been able to milk it for all that it is worth. You would think that she would want to cope with her grief with a respectable and quiet dignity. But "respectable" and "dignity" are not normally considered liberal attributes.       Here we see Cindy Sheehan at Camp Casey mourning her son at the marker placed for Casey Sheehan. This is not the resting place for Casey Sheehan.    This is the final resting place of Casey Sheehan. Even 18 months after Casey Sheehan's funeral, Cindy Sheehan has not even bothered to place a headstone. 27 May 2006  More than two years after SPC Casey Sheehan of the 1   st   Battalion, 82   nd   Field Artillery Regiment, 1   st   Cavalry Division, from Fort Hood, TX was killed by insurgents/terrorists that his mother calls  "freedom fighters" in Sadr City, Iraq, a headstone was finally placed on his grave. The headstone is a fitting marker for his resting place, reflecting his service to his community and his country, (Bronze Star and Purple Heart) but also his personal interests. May he rest in peace. Cindy Sheehan claims that she paid for the headstone, however, six weeks earlier, Cindy Sheehan stated that she did not want him to have one, saying,  "I didn't want to put a tombstone on my son's grave."  Less than two weeks earlier, Cindy Sheehan said  "On Casey Sheehan's birthday, Memorial Day, I'll be at my son's grave and have a dedication for his tombstone." That certainly sounds like a loving mother. But with dollar signs in her eyes, the lure of financial compensation was too strong for her to resist. When the tombstone was placed, Cindy was overseas spewing her anti-American rhetoric and collecting money for herself. Upon hearing the word that a headstone had been placed at her son's grave, her e-mailed response was:  "It is important for the rest of Casey's family to have one." It is enough to know that she cared to take the time to send an e-mail.  Who was really responsible for Casey Sheehan's headstone? When Patrick Sheehan, Casey's father, took over the task of acquiring a headstone for his son a few months earlier, plans for the headstone finally started in motion and the monument is in now place. The tombstone reads:      Our Casey Ever faithful, kind, and gentle, good son, beloved brother, brave soldier, dear friend, you loved your family and lived your life serving others to the end.     On the back of the headstone, there are six symbols, referring to six things that Casey enjoyed: The military, the theatre, Eagle Scouts, Superman, Van Halen, and the WWF (World Wrestling Federation).    26 November 2005  And here we have the famous anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan in Crawford, Texas as she waits to sign the next copy of her brand new book   'Not One More Mother's Child'  after its release. It looks like Cindy Sheehan has been left all alone. Even the ladies of CodePINK failed to make an appearance. It looks like even her  'friends' in the media have started dumping Cindy Sheehan. After all, they are the ones that released these less-than-desirable pictures. Here are a few websites to check out.  www.sweetness-light.com   conservativemusings.typepad.com         It appears that her book may not be quite the literary success that some thought it would be. Maybe everybody is just waiting for the movie. Did you actually write this book yourself? Here is a science question. If this book flops and no one hears it, does Cindy make any sound?       What could Cindy Sheehan be thinking about?    A lot of balloons, empty chairs, and two photographers. What a great turnout! Maybe Cindy was not as important as she once thought. Thanks to public relations groups with CodePINK and other anti-Bush groups, just a few weeks ago Cindy was receiving $30,000 per speaking engagement off of the corpse of her hero son. The party's over Cindy and now it's time for you to go home. Your so-called  'friends' have used you to advance their own selfish, anti-American agenda. You were nothing more than a pawn to them. They liked you for the mileage they got from the death of your son. And because of your vanity, you happily went along with it. It made you feel important. Your 15 minutes of fame is over. The turnout for your book signing is the proof. And here are the pictures that show how much they support you. Except for the crash of the M&M's balloon at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, there nothing else in the news cycle and even with a slow week for news, nobody bothered to show. With the printing of this book, they have probably relieved you of any and all of your dignity.  Here are a few quotes from Cindy Sheehan.  "When I was growing up, it was 'Communists'. Now it's 'Terrorists'. So you always have to have somebody to fight and be afraid of, so the war machine can build more bombs, guns, and bullets and everything." -- Cindy Sheehan  Why does Cindy Sheehan not see how dangerous these people are. They want only to kill Americans and destroy America and Western Civilization. This is no secret. They have said that. They do not try to hide their true desires on the subject. It is obvious from that statement that she does not see or believe that they are a threat on any level.    "You get America out of Iraq and Israel out of Palestine and you'll stop the terrorism." -- Cindy Sheehan      Why is it that it is OK for Jews to live under Arab rule (with no freedom of religion) in one of the smallest countries in the world, but it is not OK for Arabs to live under Israeli rule (with freedom of religion)? To understand why there is an Israel, you must ask yourself the following question. Which Muslim country is the freedom of religion practiced? According to this map at the right, it is easy to see that Israel is certainly has an unfair share of the land in the Middle East. And with all of the wars that Israel has started with the neighboring Muslim countries in the quest for sole purpose of conquering land, it is completely understandable why there is so much hate toward Israel.  (  Note sarcastic tone  )     History seems to be giving Cindy Sheehan and her Leftist friends a lot of trouble. When America was attacked, America was not in Iraq. A fact that continues to be lost on the "Peace Activists". The PLO has used car bombs since the 1960's. The reason that there is an Israel today is because of the Nazis and what they did to the Jews before and during World War II. This anti-Semitism exhibited by the Left-Wing is the reason that white supremacists have allied themselves with Cindy Sheehan, CodePINK, and rest of the elitist Left-Wing.    "What they're saying, too, is like, it's okay for Israel to have nuclear weapons. But Iran or Syria better not get nuclear weapons. It's okay for the United States to have nuclear weapons. It's okay for the countries that we say it's okay for. We are waging a nuclear war in Iraq right now. That country is contaminated. It will be contaminated for practically eternity now. It's okay for them to have them, but Iran or Syria can't have them. It's okay for Israel to occupy Palestine, but it's.. yeah.. and it's okay for Iraq to occupy.. I mean, for the United States to occupy Iraq, but it's not okay for Syria to be in Lebanon. They're a bunch of f*cking hypocrites!" -- Cindy Sheehan    This statement is right in step with the Liberal agenda. From this statement it is clear that Cindy Sheehan believes that Iran or Syria should have nuclear weapons. Who thinks that is a good idea? Apparently Cindy Sheehan does! For Iraq or Syria to have nuclear weapons will not make the world safer. Far from it. What it will do is cause the destruction of Israel and a nuclear attack on America. Cindy Sheehan does not seem to have a problem with that as a possible future. She and her America hating friends would probably believe that America would deserve that outcome.    And as far as her comment about Israel occupying Palestine, this shows that her knowledge of history is severely lacking. To understand this, you need to refer to the actions of the United Nations in 1948 after UN Resolution 181 partitioned the territory of the British Mandate for Palestine into two states for Jews and Palestinian Arabs. The Arab countries objected to the creation of the Jewish state and fought a war against its creation. This was Israel's War of Independence in 1948. The Arab's, despite their superior numbers, lost the war and the Palestinian state never really came into being because of this loss. In the war that was waged, the territory allotted to be the Palestinian state by the UN partition resolution was divided between Israel and Jordan and the "Palestinian Arabs" were rejected by every single Arab country, with the exception of a small percentage that ended up in by Jordan and then were placed into refugee camps that still exist to this day. The "Palestinian Arabs" were sacrificed as pawns by the Arab countries as they are to this day.    For more information on the people that Cindy Sheehan supports, take a good look at   HAMAS Charter of 1988  ,   The Truth About the Palestinian People  and   Islam - A Religion Based on Terrorism  .    "I was raised in a country by a public school system that taught us that America was good, that America was just. America has been killing people, like my sister over here says, since we first stepped on this continent, we have been responsible for death and destruction. I passed on that bull***t to my son and my son enlisted. I'm going all over the country telling moms: This country is not worth dying for." -- Cindy Sheehan    So now the history of America is bull***t. All of those that have sacrificed everything to make America great is considered worthless by the Left-Wing. According to this statement, all America does is kill people. America is 'Evil' and the real 'Terrorist' nation. That belief is the reason that Cindy Sheehan, CodePINK, and the rest of the Left-Wing has such a low view of America and of those that work hard to make this country great.    "I'm going all over the country telling moms: This country is not worth dying for." -- Cindy Sheehan    She did not say  'that country' referring to Iraq. She said  'this country' referring to America; the United States of America; land of the free, home of the brave. The country that has brought more freedom to more people than every other country combined in the history of the world. She was NOT misquoted in spite of all of the contradicting statements from other Left-Wing activists.    "9/11 was their Pearl Harbor to get their neo-con agenda through and, if I would have known that before my son was killed, I would have taken him to Canada. I would never have let him go and try and defend this morally repugnant system we have." -- Cindy Sheehan    "...morally repugnant system..." What she is really saying is 'morally repugnant country.' This statement shows the true hatred that Cindy Sheehan, Medea Benjamin, and the rest of the ladies of CodePINK have for this country.    Casey Sheehan was 24 years old and on his second enlistment. He had received the Bronze Star. He does not seem the kind of soldier that would have considered desertion. And this is where Cindy Sheehan sullies the good name of her son. She raises the question whether or not Casey would have deserted. America does not believe so, but apparently Cindy Sheehan believes he would. This is where Cindy Sheehan tarnishes the good name of Army Spc. Casey Sheehan.    "Why Are We In Iraq?"     We are in Iraq to fight for our country and support our allies and to give everyone the opportunity and freedom to travel anywhere in the world without fear of being killed by terrorists.    If that does not answer the question why we are in Iraq and fighting Islam around the world, maybe this video will illustrate why we fight and what we are fighting against.      Beheading of Japanese Hostage Kouda Shouse by Islamic Terrorists Video      Keep in mind that these are the terrorists that Cindy Sheehan supports.    "Monied corporate interests, tired of the years of freedom, justice, and bl*wjobs of the Clinton Presidency, gathered together with the PNAC neo-con Zionist cabal, stole the election in 2000 in order to install their candidate. They were engaged in only minor perfidy at first, looting the treasury, trying to end social security, women's rights, and so on, until they hit the mother lode on 9/11, an attack they ignored and probably, in all truthfulness, knew about ahead of time and did nothing." -- Cindy Sheehan   "Am I emotional? Yes, my first born was murdered. Am I angry? Yes, he was killed for lies and for a Neo-Con agenda to benefit Israel. My son joined the Army to protect America, not Israel. Am I stupid? No, I know full-well that my son, my family, this nation, and this world were betrayed by George [W.] Bush who was influenced by the neo-con PNAC agenda after 9/11." -- Cindy Sheehan    It is pretty easy to see from these statements, the anti-Semitism that bonds Cindy Sheehan to the many Fascist White Supremacists and Nazi groups and to the Radical Muslim groups that are killing Americans and Iraqi citizens alike.    "You know Iraq was no threat to the United States of America until we invaded. I mean they're not even a threat to the United States of America. Iraq was not involved in 9-11, Iraq was not a terrorist state. But now that we have decimated the country, the borders are open, freedom fighters from other countries are going in, and they [American troops] have created more terrorism by going to an Islamic country, devastating the country and killing innocent people in that country. The terrorism is growing and people who never thought of being car bombers or suicide bombers are now doing it because they want the United States of America out of their country." -- Cindy Sheehan    So... her son was killed by a "freedom fighter?" What a conflict for her. What does this say about her son?    "After 9/11, rather than heading to Afghanistan and deposing the Taliban and attacking Al Qaeda, they immediately launched an offensive to attack Saddam Hussein, a man they had armed to the teeth over previous decades. The point of this attack was to secure oil fields, enrich Halliburton with public treasure, and to fight a war for Israel." -- Cindy Sheehan    Again, history has eluded Cindy Sheehan. By 9/15, President Bush and the Joint Chiefs of Staff had formulated an initial battle plan and had B-1s and B-52s heading to Afghanistan to engage the Taliban and al-Qaeda.    "There has always been excuses for wars, but NONE of them have been good or valid." -- Cindy Sheehan    That might explain why she has to many friends from Neo-Nazi groups. Even Hitler was not a reason to fight for freedom.    The rest of Cindy Sheehan's quotes are the reason that she should absolutely and without question continue to be the spokesperson for the anti-war movement. In fact, Cindy Sheehan should seriously consider a run for Congress or Governor on the Democratic Party ticket. She states the Democrat Party line perfectly.      "The person who killed my son, I have no animosity for that person at all." -- Cindy Sheehan   "George Bush needs to stop talking, admit the mistakes of his all around failed administration, pull our troops out of occupied New Orleans and Iraq, and excuse his self from power." -- Cindy Sheehan   "Why do we send in invading armies to march into Afghanistan when we're looking for a select group of people in that country?" -- Cindy Sheehan   "George Bush is illegitimate and should be evicted. Let's not talk about impeachment, he was never elected. After he is impeached he should be tried for war crimes. -- Cindy Sheehan   "Thank God for the Internet, or we wouldn't know anything, and we would already be a fascist state." -- Cindy Sheehan   "We are not waging a war on terror in this country. We're waging a war of terror. The biggest terrorist in the world is George W. Bush!" -- Cindy Sheehan   "We have no Constitution. We're the only country with no checks and balances. We want our country back if we have to impeach George Bush down to the person who picks up the dog sh*t in Washington! Let George Bush send his two little party animals to die in Iraq. It's OK for Israel to have nuclear weapons but we are waging nuclear war in Iraq, we have contaminated the entire country. It's not OK for Syria to be in Lebanon. Hypocrites! But Israel can occupy Palestine? Stop the slaughter!" -- Cindy Sheehan     "After the tragedy of 9/11 we were on our way to becoming a fledgling Matriotic society until our leaders jumped on the bandwagon of inappropriate and misguided vengeance to send our young people to die and kill in two countries that were no threat to the USA or to our way of life. The neocons exploited patriotism to fulfill their goals of imperialism and plunder. This sort of patriotism begins when we enter kindergarten and learn the nationalist 'Pledge of Allegiance'. It transcends all sense when we are taught the 'Star Spangled Banner', a hymn to war." -- Cindy Sheehan   "If George Bush believes his rhetoric and his bullsh*t, that this is a war for freedom and democracy, that he is spreading freedom and democracy, does he think every person he kills makes Iraq more." -- Cindy Sheehan   "The whole world is damaged. Our humanity is damaged. If he thinks that it's so important for Iraq to have a U.S.-imposed sense of freedom and democracy, then he needs to sign up his two little party-animal girls. They need to go to this war." -- Cindy Sheehan   For more quotes from Cindy Sheehan not appearing in her book, click on this link at   Wikiquote  .  In a letter sent to the Drudge Report by Cherie Quarterolo, Casey's aunt and godmother, the family states: Our family has been so distressed by the recent activities of Cindy we are breaking our silence and we have collectively written a statement for release. Feel free to distribute it as you wish. Thanks, Cherie In response to questions regarding the Cindy Sheehan/Crawford, Texas, issue: Sheehan family statement: The Sheehan family lost our beloved Casey in the Iraq War and we have been silently, respectfully grieving. We do not agree with the political motivations and publicity tactics of Cindy Sheehan. She now appears to be promoting her own personal agenda and notoriety at the expense of her son's good name and reputation. The rest of the Sheehan family supports the troops, our country, and our president, silently, with prayer and respect.  Sincerely,  Casey Sheehan's grandparents, aunts, uncles and numerous cousins.    That pretty much sums up how the rest of Casey Sheehan's family sees Cindy Sheehan.
