Most of Iceland’s economic and commercial relations with the EU are covered by the  European Economic Area Agreement (EEA) . It is in force since 1.1.1994 and extends the Internal Market legislation, with the exception of Agriculture and Fisheries, from the EU Member States to Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Through the EEA Agreement, Iceland also participates, albeit with no voting rights, in a number of EU Agencies and programs, covering i.a. enterprise, environment, education and research programs. Iceland also, along with its EEA/EFTA partners, contributes financially to social and economic cohesion in the EU/EEA. Trade in fish products is governed by separate bilateral agreements. Iceland is an associate member of the  Schengen agreement since 2000 which entails cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs. Iceland is also associated to the  Dublin Convention  . Iceland has been a member of  EFTA since 1970 and has a bilateral Free Trade Agreement with the EEC since 1972. The Government of Iceland submitted  its application for EU-Membership  [45 KB] to the current Swedish Presidency of the Council of the EU in a letter dated on 16 July. At the Council meeting on 27 July, EU Foreign Affairs Ministers acknowledged Iceland's application for membership of the European Union and invited the Commission to submit an opinion on it.
