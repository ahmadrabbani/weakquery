The new figures for 2010 mean that levels of  greenhouse gases are higher than the  worst case scenario outlined by climate experts just four years ago. "The more we talk about the need to control emissions, the more they are growing," said  John Reilly , co-director of MIT's Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change. The world pumped about 564 million more tons (512 million metric tons) of carbon into the air in 2010 than it did in 2009. That's an increase of 6 percent. That amount of extra pollution eclipses the individual emissions of all but three countries — China, the United States and India, the world's top producers of greenhouse gases. It is a "monster" increase that is unheard of, said Gregg Marland, a professor of geology at  Appalachian State University , who has helped calculate Department of Energy figures in the past. Extra pollution in China and the U.S. account for more than half the increase in emissions last year, Marland said. "It's a big jump," said Tom Boden, director of the Energy Department's Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center at Oak Ridge National Lab. "From an emissions standpoint, the global financial crisis seems to be over." Boden said that in 2010 people were traveling, and manufacturing was back up worldwide, spurring the use of fossil fuels, the chief contributor of man-made  climate change . India and China are huge users of coal. Burning coal is the biggest carbon source worldwide and emissions from that jumped nearly 8 percent in 2010. "The good news is that these economies are growing rapidly so everyone ought to be for that, right?" Reilly said Thursday. "Broader economic improvements in poor countries has been bringing living improvements to people. Doing it with increasing reliance on coal is imperiling the world." In 2007, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its last large report on global warming, it used different scenarios for carbon dioxide pollution and said the rate of warming would be based on the rate of pollution. Boden said the latest figures put global emissions higher than the worst case projections from the climate panel. Those forecast global temperatures rising between 4 and 11 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century with the best estimate at 7.5 degrees. Even though global warming skeptics have attacked the climate change panel as being too alarmist, scientists have generally found their predictions too conservative, Reilly said. He said his university worked on emissions scenarios, their likelihood, and what would happen. The IPCC's worst case scenario was only about in the middle of what MIT calculated are likely scenarios. Chris Field of Stanford University, head of one of the IPCC's working groups, said the panel's emissions scenarios are intended to be more accurate in the long term and are less so in earlier years. He said the question now among scientists is whether the future is the panel's worst case scenario "or something more extreme." "Really dismaying," Granger Morgan, head of the engineering and public policy department at Carnegie Mellon University, said of the new figures. "We are building up a horrible legacy for our children and grandchildren." But Reilly and University of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver found something good in recent emissions figures. The developed countries that ratified the 1997 Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gas limiting treaty have reduced their emissions overall since then and have achieved their goals of cutting emissions to about 8 percent below 1990 levels. The U.S. did not ratify the agreement. In 1990, developed countries produced about 60 percent of the world's greenhouse gases, now it's probably less than 50 percent, Reilly said. "We really need to get the developing world because if we don't, the problem is going to be running away from us," Weaver said. "And the problem is pretty close from running away from us." ___ Online: Government carbon dioxide info center: http://cdiac.ornl.gov/      @yahoonews on Twitter, become a fan on  Facebook         Editors' Picks    slideshow Occupy Wall Street protests     slideshow Sexiest Man Alive?     slideshow Duke's Coach K makes history     slideshow Rare yellow diamond fetches $11 million     story Is panic causing triathletes to die?     slideshow Twilight premiere in L.A.

R    •    Greenbelt, United States     •    5 days ago   This is not a hard number to calculate. We know how much coal, oil and fossil fuels we are burning. We know how much goes into the atmosphere and how much into the oceans (where it lowers the pH of the water). We can measure the CO2 content of the atmosphere and watch it rise in lockstep with predictions.  In this "debate" there are two sides--scientists and pudknockers. Me, I think I'll go with the scientists on this one.           Bustit    •    Atlantic Mine, United States     •    about a week ago   Govt can't control spending, how can they possibly control the climate.           robert    about a week ago   of course gasses are building up....the cause is called campaigning           slipkidd    •    Detroit, United States     •    about a week ago   the united states has the cleanest factories in the world that now sit idle.           bigwhoop    •    Denver, United States     •    about a week ago   In the end, Mother Nature will kick all our #$%$           Raymond    about a week ago   If this is such a big deal, why not cut taxes on US companies that move jobs back here? Since we pollute less than India and China, that would eliminate some of the greenhouse gases. We would also cut back on the gases produced during shipping.  I call that a win-win. Americans back to work and you get to cut greenhouse gases.           A J    •    Raleigh, United States     •    about a week ago   So long and thanks for all the fish!           whiffer    about a week ago   Since China and India aren't going to reduce their industrial base or make any effort to clean up their businesses, where does one expect an improvement is going to come from? I thought so. So as we continue in the US to destroy our manufacturing, it goes overseas where it will create more CO2 per widget than would have been created here. Great strategy.           Michael J    about a week ago   Plant more trees, they love carbon-dioxide and will scrub the air for us.

MyTwoBits    about a week ago   Wow some of you in here really need to get a basic education. Just because you may want to dispute the FACTS, does not mean that the facts are wrong. Seems intersting that some fo the same people who are so worried about leaving massive debt to their future generations, aren't as worried about those same future generations having an habitable planet to live on. Won't make much difference if there is money or not, if the air isn't breathable, or the land can't grow anything!           Larry    •    Topeka, United States     •    about a week ago   Get rid of all the gas in washington and that will solve the problem.
