Assembly Bill 32 Includes a Number of Specific Requirements: ARB shall prepare and approve a scoping plan for achieving the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from sources or categories of sources of greenhouse gases by 2020 (Health and Safety Code (HSC) �38561).  The  scoping plan , approved by the ARB Board  December 12, 2008 , provides the outline for actions to reduce greenhouse gases in California.  The  approved scoping plan indicates how these emission reductions will be achieved from significant greenhouse gas sources via  regulations , market mechanisms and  other actions .  Identify the statewide level of greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 to serve as the emissions limit to be achieved by 2020 (HSC �38550).   In  December 2007 , the Board approved the  2020 emission limit of 427 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2E) of greenhouse gases.  Adopt a regulation requiring the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions (HSC �38530).  In  December 2007 , the Board adopted a regulation requiring the largest industrial sources to  report and  verify their greenhouse gas emissions.  The  reporting regulation serves as a solid foundation to determine greenhouse gas emissions and track future changes in emission levels.

Ensure early voluntary reductions receive appropriate credit in the implementation of AB 32 (HSC �38562(b)(3)).  In February 2008, the Board approved a  policy statement encouraging  voluntary early actions and establishing a procedure for project proponents to submit quantification methods to be evaluated by ARB.  ARB, along with California’s  local air districts and the  California Climate Action Registry , is working to implement this program.  Convene an Environmental Justice Advisory Committee (EJAC) to advise the Board in developing the Scoping Plan and any other pertinent matter in implementing AB 32 (HSC �38591).  The  EJAC has met  12 times since early 2007, providing comments on the proposed early action measures and the development of the scoping plan, and submitted its  comments and recommendations on the scoping plan in October 2008.  ARB will continue to work with the EJAC as AB 32 is implemented.  Appoint an Economic and Technology Advancement Advisory Committee (ETAAC) to provide recommendations for technologies, research and greenhouse gas emission reduction measures (HSC �38591).  After a year-long public process, The  ETAAC submitted a  report of their recommendations to the Board in  February 2008 . The ETAAC also reviewed and provided comments on the scoping plan.  AB 32 Timeline By Jan 1, 2009 - ARB adopts plan indicating how emission reductions will be achieved from significant sources of GHGs via  regulations ,  market mechanisms and other actions.  During 2009 - ARB staff drafts rule language to implement its plan and holds a series of public workshop on each measure (including market mechanisms).  By Jan 1, 2010 - Early action measures take effect.  During 2010 - ARB conducts series of rulemakings, after workshops and public hearings, to adopt GHG regulations including rules governing market mechanisms.  By Jan 1, 2011 - ARB completes major rulemakings for reducing GHGs including market mechanisms. ARB may revise the rules and adopt new ones after 1/1/2011 in furtherance of the 2020 cap.  By Jan 1, 2012 - GHG rules and  market mechanisms adopted by ARB take effect and are legally enforceable.  December 31, 2020 - Deadline for achieving 2020 GHG emissions cap.
