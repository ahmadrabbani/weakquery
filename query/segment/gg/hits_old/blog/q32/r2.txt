Global Warming Can Be Stopped, World Climate Experts Say    Global Warming Interactive: Learn About Its Causes and Effects       Is It Happening?  Yes. Earth is already showing many signs of worldwide climate change.   Average temperatures have climbed 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degree Celsius) around the world since 1880, much of this in recent decades, according to NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.   The rate of warming is increasing. The 20th century's last two decades were the hottest in 400 years and possibly the warmest for several millennia, according to a number of climate studies. And the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that 11 of the past 12 years are among the dozen warmest since 1850.   The Arctic is feeling the effects the most. Average temperatures in Alaska, western Canada, and eastern Russia have risen at twice the global average, according to the multinational Arctic Climate Impact Assessment report compiled between 2000 and 2004.   Arctic ice is rapidly disappearing, and the region may have its first completely  ice-free summer by 2040 or earlier.  Polar bears and indigenous cultures are already suffering from the sea-ice loss.   Glaciers and mountain snows are rapidly melting—for example,  Montana's Glacier National Park now has only 27 glaciers, versus 150 in 1910. In the Northern Hemisphere, thaws also come a week earlier in spring and freezes begin a week later.   Coral reefs, which are highly sensitive to small changes in water temperature, suffered the  worst bleaching—or die-off in response to stress—ever recorded in 1998 , with some areas seeing bleach rates of 70 percent. Experts expect these sorts of events to increase in frequency and intensity in the next 50 years as sea temperatures rise.   An upsurge in the amount of extreme weather events, such as  wildfires ,  heat waves , and  strong tropical storms , is also attributed in part to climate change by some experts.
