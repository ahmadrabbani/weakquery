By  Lindsay Silberman |  TV Guide  –  Mon, Oct 3, 2011 9:48 AM PDT               Arrested Development  creator  Mitch Hurwitz announced at  The New Yorker Festival Sunday that the sitcom will return to television for one abbreviated season. The series will focus on what the characters have been doing since the show was canceled in 2006. The new season will serve as the precursor to an  Arrested Development movie, which has been  kicking around for years . Check out: Fall TV Eye Candy Shortly after the  The New Yorker panel -- first reported by  TVLine.com --  Jason Bateman  tweeted : "It's true. We will do 10 episodes and the movie. Probably shoot them all together next summer for a release in early '13. VERY excited!" The show premiered in 2003, and was cancelled after only three seasons despite its cult following.

The characters were placed in such awkward situations they became funny. This is where Micheal Cera always stars in. Dammit. Cant wait.
