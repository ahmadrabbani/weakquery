About Citizen Pop  The Citizen's David Wilcox checks in with his thoughts on all things pop culture - movies, music, TV, video games, celebrity and more.    You'd think everyone learned from "Arrested Development." Critical darling TV shows aren't the kind of instant-gratification ratings hits that network executives crave, but the loyalty they attract can pay off in the long haul. Just look at "AD" now: The Internet pretty much exploded at the October news of the series' return to TV and theaters after five years off the air. Seems NBC needs reminding. The network announced Monday that "Community," for my money the best comedy on TV, will not be returning in the spring. Whether it's cancelled - like "AD" - or going on sabbatical - like fellow Thursday-night hit "Parks and Recreation" - isn't known right now. The latter would be preferable not only because it means the show will coming back, but because the months off seemed to give "Parks and Rec" a boost in both popularity and creative energy. Still, benching "Community" earns NBC a failing grade. The show regularly toys with and dissects sitcom tropes when it isn't ignoring them in favor of flat-out original surrealism, and its ensemble cast is among the strongest on TV. No other show can give us moments so absurdly funny as campus security officer Chang (Ken Jeong) clashing with aspiring rebel Britta (Gillian Jacobs) to the tune of "Hello" by Lionel Richie, or consummate douche Jeff Winger (Joel McHale) slowly letting loose during a green-screen karaoke duet to "Kiss From a Rose" by Seal with his creepy stalker dean (Jim Rash). If "Community" is following the arc of "Arrested Development" - cancelled before much of the viewing public realizes its genius - many of you will cherish those moments and more as you see them on DVD, Netflix, Hulu, etc. Then, in 2017 or so, we'll all be celebrating when the students of Greendale Community College return to the screen. It's just a shame we may have to wait that long. -David      Copyright 2011 AuburnPub.com. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
