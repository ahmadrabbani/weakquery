There was a lot of nodding and cheering, followed by an expectant pause. Would they? Wouldn't they? Jason Bateman kindly offered that they would perform like monkeys for us at the end of the evening, and The Huffington Post was there to capture the magic. Clearly, Gob and Lindsay are the stars here (note: Tobias takes a backseat), but unfortunately there wasn't much "caw-caw"-ing involved.
