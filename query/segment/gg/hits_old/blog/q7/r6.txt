Stewart  mocked Cain on Monday for his  somewhat shambolic response to a story that he faced sexual harassment charges during the 1990s. Stewart mostly seemed to be making double entendres, but Trump saw his take, and his brief impersonation of Cain, as bigoted. "How come Jon Stewart gets away with a very very racist rant against Herman Cain?" he wondered. "...It's not what he said but the way he said it. The tone of his voice, the inflection. Unbelievable! Anybody else, deep deep trouble." Trump called for Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton to denounce Stewart, and asked "sleepy-eyed Chuck Todd" to criticize the "horrible, horrible thing" the comedian had done. He said Stewart had been "insulting" to African Americans and should apologize. Below, watch the segment in question. Do you agree with Trump?
