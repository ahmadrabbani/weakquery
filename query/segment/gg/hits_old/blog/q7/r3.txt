But, when he played a short clip of Bachmann's moderate-seeming take on Pakistan, Stewart was surprised: "You know sometimes because of all the crazy s**t that you say, it's easy to forget that you sit on the  House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence so you actually know something about Pakistan." Same thing happened when a Santorum remark was played: "Oh, right, you were on the Senate Armed Services Committee, so you know that Pakistan and Iran are complicated issues."       @yahoonews on Twitter, become a fan on  Facebook         Editors' Picks    slideshow Occupy Wall Street protests     slideshow Sexiest Man Alive?     slideshow Duke's Coach K makes history     slideshow Rare yellow diamond fetches $11 million     story Is panic causing triathletes to die?     slideshow Twilight premiere in L.A.

You can see them on Comedy Central's site. He was making an important point that people who know a lot about a subject can give more nuanced answers. Those who know nothing shoot from the hip and can give no details. He also showed Huntsman's comments about China compared to those who know nothing about it.           Gary    •    New York, United States     •    Yesterday   FOX dosen't want you to watch Stewart because even as a comic he has more intelligent things to say and is more balanced than anyone on that propaganda machine. If you don't think so, it's because you haven't actually seen the show. He has guests on from the entire political spectrum and treats them all with respect.           Mr DuckyWucky    Yesterday   Has it ever occurred to you people that maybe viewers of Jon Stewart are just a little bit smarter than the average joe?               •    Blair, United States     •    Yesterday   You mean Stewart's show really isnt comedy???, hmmm           Thomas    Yesterday   Jon Stewart is by far more fair and balanced than the entire cast of Fox News.           Gary    •    New York, United States     •    Yesterday   FOX watchers keep saying that the Daily Show isn't news, but FOX shows clips on their shows. Which means that their shows aren't news either since they are showing non-news. I guess you FOX watchers are right. FOX isn't news.           Mr. K    •    San Diego, United States     •    Yesterday   Stewert calls 'em like he sees 'em. Did you catch last thursday, when he showed a pic of the "democratic machine" Cain keeps complaining about? He said "It costs billions of dollars, runs on solar power, and turns hope into despair." Ouch! Jon yanks on *everyone's* cojones.           Eric1    Yesterday   The POINT here, which most of you seemed to have missed, is that Jon Stewart gives EQUAL time to BOTH sides in his jabs. He has mocked President Obama MANY times, and poked fun at a number of liberal issues when they seemed ripe for it (he has even had a lot of fun with the OWS crowd as well). Yes, he DOES mock and point out the stupidities of conservative candidates, but only when they ARE stupidities to any reasonable person and by any reasonable measure, and he has NO time for the kind of ridiculous, and even DANGEROUS propaganda that seems to flood this country of ours. So why should anyone be surprised when he ALSO points out that once in a while, even the most ABSURD political figures can say something reasonable? Why should he not ALSO point that out?           no name    Yesterday   Perhaps Bachman and Santorum remembered that Pakistan is already a nuclear nation. This example demonstrates clearly why any nation would want to achieve nuclar capability - even the most wacked out hatemongering lunatics have to take you seriously with a nuclear bomb or two about the place...           Blair    •    Jacksonville, United States     •    Yesterday   Sorry Jon, she still pretty damm stupid           joel    •    Dallas, United States     •    Yesterday   Why is that the people who seem most against Jon Stewart are the ones that never watch his show? To the poster who claims to be a professor who reads a lot I would be willing to be that Jon has read more than you ever have. If you think he was agreeing with Pelosi you have no concept of sarcasm..           MyohMy    •    Pensacola, United States     •    Yesterday   Bachmann screams socialism -- meanwhile she gets her salary and health care on tax payers dime, she got $500,000 in farm subsidy in 2010, and her clinic gets paid with medicare. However, the Right will rationalize anything for a TB candidate even when they don't agree with specific policies -- Hypocrites.           The Truth    •    Los Alamitos, United States     •    Yesterday   The networks are doing Bachmann and Santorum a BIG favor by giving them ANY press. It's time for the RNC (or whoever) to remove them from serious debates since they have zero chance of making it thru the entire series of debates. Who is stupid enough to donate to their campaigns anyway?           Randy Holecanoff    Yesterday   Bachmann relies too much on absurdity and sensationalism to try and gain ground in the public eye. She is recognized as "whacko", and rightly so. Minnesota should be proud.           Lew    •    Minneapolis, United States     •    Yesterday   For those of you who think Stewart only rants on repugniKKKants, he also gives it to Obama regularly. If you think you'd understand, you could join his 3,000,000 nightly viewers and see for yourself           SeaTurt1e    •    Camp Hill, United States     •    Yesterday   So what you're saying, Jon, is that they're capable of giving informed, nuanced answers to questions they actually know something about? Hmmm... Makes you wonder if they simply don't know much about all the other stuff so they make up something crazy, or else they simply don't realize that if the stuff they know about requires nuance, then maybe the stuff they don't know anything about should not be reduced to ideological pablum as well.           Noah H    •    Lake Havasu City, United States     •    Yesterday   A stopped clock is right twice a day. I dunno..I'm sticking with Barack mainly becasue nobody in the GOP/Tea/Fox/Jesus freak party knows or cares much about the 95% of us that work entirely for wages...mostly low wages and mostly meager or no benefits. When we get old we 'require' Social Security and Medicare.           bobbyA    Yesterday   I've got nothing against Stewart - he's a funny guy. But that's the point. . . He's a comedian, not a newsman. So, any of you who take what he says as 'news' are missing the point of the show. . .           RaisingCane    •    Hobe Sound, United States     •    Yesterday   Bachman and her supporters are still nutz. Good thing almost ALL americans see that. Can't see Crazy in the mirror though.           viewer42    Yesterday   I gotta laugh at the RW's responses to reasonable statements are almost always the PeeWee Herman response..."I know you are but what am I"...!!          More     Post a comment     [ [ [['Dekraai', 10]], 'http://news.yahoo.com/photos/mourners-remember-seal-beach-shooting-victims-1318620627-slideshow/', 'Click image to see more photos', 'http://l.yimg.com/a/p/us/news/editorial/3/2c/32c8e92d889f42edb719cb5257afdf4e.jpeg', '461', ' ', 'Reuters/Lori Shepler', ], [ [['iPhone 4SXXXXXXX', 11]], 'http://news.yahoo.com/photos/thousands-line-up-for-apple-s-iphone-4s-1318602841-slideshow/', 'Click image to see more photos', 'http://l.yimg.com/a/p/us/news/editorial/f/4f/f4f15e8f6f323f5386dc9fdf9e15dca8.jpeg', '500', ' ', 'AP/Kirsty Wigglesworth', ] ]  [ [ [['xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', 11]], '27013743', '0' ], [ [['keyword', 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999]], 'videoID', '1', 'overwrite-pre-description', 'overwrite-link-string', 'overwrite-link-url' ] ]     You on Yahoo!
