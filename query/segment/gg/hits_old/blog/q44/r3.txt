According to the Wall Street Journal, Stern is in talks with NBC to join  Sharon Osbourne and  Howie Mandel on the NBC talent competition show, which is due to return in 2012. In addition, the show -- which is currently Los Angeles-based -- may relocated to New York to accommodate Stern, who will continue hosting his daily Sirius XM radio show. The WSJ reports that a $15 million a year contract is on the table and that an additional $10 million could be spent moving the production to New York. On Wednesday, Morgan  tweeted that he was leaving "AGT" to focus on his CNN show,  "Piers Morgan Tonight" and coverage of the 2012 presidential election. Stern was one of several names mentioned as a possible replacement when  Simon Cowell left "American Idol" -- an opening that was filled by Aerosmith's  Steven Tyler . What do you think? Is Stern the right man for the job?   Follow  Zap2it on Twitter and  Zap2it on Facebook for the latest news and buzz            «  Will 'Twilight' fans fall for 'The Vampire Diaries' in Season 3?
