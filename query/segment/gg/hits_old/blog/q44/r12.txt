"What the f**** did (LeBron James) do wrong?" Stern said. "He's a basketball player who made a s***load of money for this owner – for mas'sa - And the people of Cleveland – shame on you – anybody listening from Cleveland." "Here's how I look at it," Stern continued. "LeBron James is an extraordinary basketball player, and suddenly in the slavery system of the NBA – and I call it 'slavery' because it's high-paid slavery, but nevertheless, they have this salary cap. Here's a guy who's devoted himself to basketball – notice the owners don't have salary caps. They make as much money as they want with their franchise." As for Gilbert, Stern called him "a f****ing lunatic." "They should strip him naked and tar and feather him," Stern said.      Never thought I would see the day when Howard Stern and Jesse Jackson actually agreed upon something.  Very interesting to say the least.
