Howard Stern (Credit: HowardStern.com)  On his radio show today, Stern said Sirius is the best place for him. The move is likely to allay fears that the satellite radio company would lose a big chunk of subscribers if Stern left. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but are likely to wind up in a regulatory filing.  The more interesting wrinkle with the Stern deal is that his show will now be available on the Sirius XM app, which is available on various platforms such as the Apple's  iPhone ,  Android devices, and RIM's BlackBerry. Stern staying with Sirius XM and appearing on mobile apps should accelerate the day where pricey satellites aren't the main distribution method for the company.
