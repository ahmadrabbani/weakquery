Answer:  February 2006 Howard Stern has been known to play a prank or two on those close to him. That's why people believed the rumor when they heard that he married model  Beth Ostrosky on a recent trip to Mexico. Alas, that rumor turned out to be completely untrue. While they are dating and have been for a few years now, the couple is not married. During his very first broadcast on Sirius satellite radio on January 9, 2006, Howard let the public know that his relationship with Beth was still going strong, but they have definitely not taken the plunge. I wonder if Howard will ever get the courage to drop to one knee...
