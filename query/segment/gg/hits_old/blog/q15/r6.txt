The versions, which have significant design commonality, are the conventional take-off and landing ( CTOL ) variant, short take-off and vertical landing ( STOVL ) and carrier variant ( CV ). Globally, the  JSF is the largest fighter aircraft program, with an expected total value of  US$ 383 billion, and production expected to top 5,000 aircraft. Canada is one of nine countries partnering on the  JSF program, along with the  U.S. ,  UK , Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Norway, Denmark and Australia. It is estimated that the partner countries will be purchasing about 3,000 aircraft, and 2,000 will be exported to other countries. Canada has been a participant in the  JSF program since 1997, when the Department of National Defence signed on to the Concept Demonstration phase with an investment of  US$ 10 million. As part of this phase, Canada participated in the extensive and rigorous U.S.-led competitive process where two bidders, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, developed and competed prototype aircraft. This process led to the selection of Lockheed Martin as the  JSF manufacturer in 2001, to develop, integrate and manufacture the aircraft. Lockheed Martin's major industrial partners include Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems. There are also two primes for the development and production of propulsion systems for the  JSF , Pratt & Whitney, which produces the F135 engine, and the  GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team, producing the F136 engine. In 2002, Canada continued its  JSF participation by joining the System Development and Demonstration ( SDD ) phase of the program, which runs until 2015. Canada's financial commitment in SDD was  US$ 100 million and  US$ 50 million through Canadian technology investment programs such as the  Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative . This early involvement has been providing Canadian industry with the opportunity to maximize its integration in the  JSF supply chain, and provided the government with the program and technical data to assess the aircraft.  In 2006, Canada signed on to the  JSF Production, Sustainment and Follow-on Development ( PSFD ) Memorandum of Understanding. The  PSFD phase is scheduled between 2007–2051 and the cost for Canada to participate is  US$ 551 million, which will cover Canada's portion of production, sustainment and follow-on development program costs.  The  JSF program delivers on the   Canada First Defence Strategy 's commitment to a renewed relationship with Canada's defence industry, leveraging Canada's competitive advantage and working with industry to help position Canadian companies for success in the global marketplace. In 2006, Industry Canada signed Memoranda of Understanding containing industrial participation plans with each of the prime contractors (Lockheed Martin, Pratt & Whitney,  GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team). These agreements ensure that Canadian companies can compete for work on the  JSF program, including the airframe, systems, engines and associated services. The industrial participation plans outline the opportunities available to Canadian industry, currently valued at  C$ 12 billion. Opportunities include providing a wide range of manufacturing and services in areas such as major structural assemblies, electronic systems, advanced composites, high speed machining, simulation and training, tooling, sustainment, and landing gear maintenance. Industry Canada works with partners including the Departments of  National Defence and  Foreign Affairs and International Trade , the regional economic development agencies and the  Industrial Technologies Office to maximize Canadian industrial participation on the program through activities such as opportunity identification, awareness and outreach, technology investment, and capability matching. The Government of Canada announced on July 16, 2010 its plan to purchase 65  CTOL  JSF   F-35  Lightning II fighter aircraft, committing approximately  C$ 9 billion for the acquisition of the aircraft and associated weapons, infrastructure, initial spares, training simulators, contingency funds and project operating costs. Canada is purchasing this fifth generation fighter aircraft through the preferential mechanisms of the multinational  JSF  PSFD Memorandum of Understanding and delivery of the new aircraft is expected to start in 2016. In the meantime, the  CF-18 fighter aircraft, expected to reach the end of their operational life in the 2017–2020 timeframe, will remain in service as Canada's front line tactical fighter aircraft until the  F-35s are in service. The decision to acquire the  F-35s allows Canadian companies to proceed with the investments and equipment purchases necessary to capture the available opportunities. By embedding in the  JSF global supply chain, innovating, and investing to remain competitive, industry can gain the greatest benefit from Canada's participation, creating jobs and sustained economic benefits to regions across Canada. In order to maximize industrial benefits and increase affordability, the partner countries agreed to a best-value approach to industrial participation which awards work to the most competitive companies. Canadian industry is well positioned to be successful and companies are gaining long-lasting, high quality business. The involvement of Canadian industry from the beginning of the multi-year, multi-billion dollar program with an international market has provided unprecedented access to a significant multinational defence program for companies across Canada, including small and medium enterprises. To date, 85 companies, research laboratories and universities have received over  C$ 350 million in contracts, whereas Canada has invested a  US$ 168 million contribution to the program to date. As the program enters full-rate production to produce upwards of 3,000 aircraft for the  JSF partner countries, many more contracts will be accrued as Canadian industry benefits from the full economies of scale in this program. Canadian industrial participation for global sustainment of the aircraft, which will include activities such as maintenance, repairs, logistics and simulation and training, is being further developed. Significant industrial benefits related to  JSF in-service support are expected over a 40 year time span.
