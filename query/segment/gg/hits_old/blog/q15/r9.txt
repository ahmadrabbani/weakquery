Col. Matt “Opie” Taylor pilots the second F-35C test aircraft (CF-2) during its arrival Monday at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, where it was scheduled to begin test and evaluation. CF-2 is the designated loads test aircraft, which will expand the flight envelope for maneuvering. The F-35C is the carrier variant of the Joint Strike Fighter undergoing test and evaluation in preparation for delivery to the fleet.

"This year, we are really starting to hit stride," said Steve Callaghan, director of the F-35's Washington operations for Lockheed Martin. Callaghan said the three variants have already achieved 331 test flights, far exceeding the 252 planned flights. The F-35 program aims to restock the military's aging strike fighter forces. The Air Force has planned to order 1,763 and the Navy will order 680. There are now 20 test jets in the program in three variations: a conventional takeoff and landing F-35A for the Air Force; a short takeoff/vertical landing F-35B for the Marines; and an aircraft carrier-ready F-35C for the Navy. The Air Force has already accepted two production-model F-35A aircraft into its fleet at Edwards Air Force Base. The Marine Corps version has completed enough vertical landings on shore to begin sea trials later this year. The second of two F-35C aircraft recently completed its inaugural flight and was delivered Monday to Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Md. to join the base's F-35 test fleet, which includes the first F-35C and four F-35B jets. "As of today there are two ‘C' variants," Callaghan said. "Another will ferry there next month." An F-35A carries a base price of about $65 million. Callaghan said the Marine Corps and Navy variants cost about $70 million. Among the jet's high-tech achievements is the integration of radar-evading stealth technology into a fighter jet, making the aircraft better equipped for get-in, get-out reconnaissance missions - and making them more predatory. "It lets you see the other guy, shoot the other guy, kill the other guy," without being detected, Callaghan said. While older aircraft can be made less visible on radar, Callaghan said a truly stealth aircraft has to be built from the ground up using special materials and sleek designs that conceal radar-reflective surfaces like weapons and fuel tanks. The Joint Strike Fighter program is unique in its use of an "economy of commonality," as opposed to designing and testing three totally different jets for Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy. "All mission systems, radar, electro-optical targeting systems, software engines - all if it is virtually identical in all three variants," Callaghan said. The F-35 is a fifth-generation, single-engine, single-pilot, supersonic, multi-role fighter designed to fly farther, faster and carry a heavier weapons payload than its fourth-generation predecessors. Advanced communications allow for pilots to send and receive information instantly, increasing the pilot's situational awareness. The Joint Strike Fighter program is responsible for 127,000 direct and indirect jobs nationwide. More than 25,000 of those jobs are in California, with about 260 suppliers providing parts, equipment and services to the development of the jets. Earlier this year, the Navy named Naval Air Station Lemoore and Naval Air Facility El Centro as contenders to base the West Coast fleet of F-35C aircraft. A final decision is pending an environmental impact statement, which will be available for public comment in 2012 and completed in spring 2013. The document will weigh environmental issues to decide which base is best able to serve as home base to the seven active-duty squadrons (70 aircraft) and one training squadron (30 aircraft). The Navy has proposed a one-for-one replacement of 109 aging F/A-18C Hornet aircraft from the Pacific Fleet, expected to begin in 2015 and be completed in 2025.
