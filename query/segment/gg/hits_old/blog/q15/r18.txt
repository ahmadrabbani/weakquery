Mr Fitzgibbon toured the Lockheed Martin production line at Fort Worth, Texas, earlier this month and at the time said it was likely to be part of Australia's future defence. But he is resisting opposition calls to lock the nation into a contract until he is satisfied about price, capability and delivery schedule.

"(Opposition defence spokesman) Nick Minchin for some reason wants me to race in and sign about a year before I have to, before I've got reassurances on their ability to deliver the capability and, of course, on cost and schedule. "I won't, I'll keep Lockheed Martin guessing, I'll continue to talk to people about other alternatives." The decision would also have to wait until after the nation's future needs were spelled out in the Air Capability Review and Defence White Paper, both of which are set to be released early next year. The F-35 Lightning Joint Strike Fighter is an advanced, stealthy, multi-role aircraft which would replace ageing F-111 bombers and F/A-18 fighters from around the middle of next decade. The federal government is considering buying 100 aircraft with the first to come off the line in 2013. No contract has been signed as yet, although Australia has contributed around $400 million to development costs.  © 2011  AAP Brought to you by       Join the conversation You're the only person reading this now.
