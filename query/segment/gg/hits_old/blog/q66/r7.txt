 Jihad Watch      Saudi Arabia: Women Must Cover Provocative Eyes   According to a report that appeared on  Al Arabiyya News , Saudi Arabia’s Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice has confirmed that it will begin “interfering with” and “ordering” women to cover their eyes, “if they provoke  fitna [sedition, chaos].” The spokesman added, “Our men have every right to do so." The above picture is a video snapshot from the TV report.

Long may it continue: Dark eyes, passionate eyes Burning and splendid eyes How I love you, how I fear you Verily, I espied you in an ill-starred moment Oh, not for nothing are you darker than the deep! I see mourning for my soul in you, I see a triumphant flame in you: A poor heart immolated in it. But I am not sad, I am not sorrowful, My fate is soothing to me: All that is best in life, God gave us. In sacrifice I returned to the fiery eyes! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE-9naVI32E          johnmatt  |   November 16, 2011 11:57 AM  |  Reply    Ooh, scary. The country will collapse. Watch out. Another great excuse to beat women with whips in the street. But I'm still a little surprised - no mention of black magic or witchcraft, the standard Saudi fall-backs.

How are they supposed to see where they are going?  Of all the things I have learned about Islam in the past few years, the one thing I don't hear talked about or explained in depth is Islam's deep hatred of women. On the one hand, Mohammad seemed to have so many of them. Yet, Islamic cultures demonstrate a visceral hatred of them.  I still don't quite understand this.         Marylou  |   November 16, 2011 2:31 PM  |  Reply    Let's see...since the  one-eyed burqa,  also a Saudi invention, still leaves one eye exposed, maybe the answer is to put women in body bags without peep holes and have the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice buy them each a seeing-eye dog.  Oh, that's right...never mind.         EZ Rider  |   November 16, 2011 3:35 PM  |  Reply    It seems to me that as sexually oriented that islam is, male muslams should want all parts of their female muslams exposed.  I can see it coming.....All women must be covered completely except for their breasts, buttocks, and genitals for easier access. How 'bout it ladies? I hate islam.

A hypnotically-beautiful setting of the Latin translation (I think, the Vulgate, the medieval Latin version) of a portion of the Hebrew scripture, the Song of Song's which is Solomon's. In the English translation it is Song of Songs, chapter 6, verses 4-5. Pulchra es, amica mea suavis et decora filia Ierusalem. Pulchra es, amica mea suavis et decora sicut Jerusalem,  terribilis ut castrorum acies ordinata. Averte oculos tuos a me quia ipsi me avolare fecerunt. "Thou are beautiful, O my love sweet and seemly daughter of Jerusalem. Thou art beautiful, O my love,  sweet and comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners. Turn away your eyes from me for they have overcome me".

After all, this is Saudi Barbaria we're talking about!         Skeen66  replied to  comment from Mo |   November 17, 2011 4:33 AM  |  Reply    Mo: According to Islam, women are to be feared because they are "distractions" from what "good" Muslim men must love first and to the exclusion of all else: Allah. This, of course, renders all Muslim men as selfless ciphers of each other. Becoming abject worshippers of Allah is difficult, however, and Allah, who is a cruel, capricious S.O.B. by any moral measure, created women just to make it harder for Muslim men to kiss his feet, or sit on his right hand, or whatever the brownie point arrangement is “up there.” This explains not only making women cover themselves up, but all the rapes, the discounted legal testimony of women, wife and women beating, honor killings, and so on. These are all representative of Muslim men acting to be "closer" to Allah. This is the other side of the coin of “jihad,” or the “struggle,” and of course it extends to the rest of the world. The Paradise end of Islam is another idiotic irony, however. Women are disdained in Islam, but a “martyr” is promised 72 self-renewing virgins if he dies waging war against the infidel. What’s prohibited the “good” Muslim on earth is supposed to be in plenitude in an after-life, scores of equally deferential and second-class status women with “provocative eyes” at his beck and call, and who presumably don’t talk back. Women being sexual on earth is a no-no; in Paradise, it’s an employment requirement.          Skeen66  |   November 17, 2011 4:43 AM  |  Reply    Mo: Search as I might, I cannot see anywhere in Islamic literature what the after-life reward is for female suicide bombers. One would think that it would be 72 jocks. Maybe it's to become a renewable virgin. Who knows? I have no idea what suicide-bomb recruiters say to these pathetic creatures, but it must be a whopper. However, there's no reason to be found anywhere in Islam, and Muslims, male and female, have minds weakened by a lifetime of deference to religious authority. They'll believe anything.          meekee  |   November 17, 2011 4:56 AM  |  Reply    If those eyes could only see If those lips could only speak If those beautiful golden tresses were there in reality If you could only take my hand As you did when you took my name But you're only a beautiful picture in a beautiful golden frame. ............. revised to:- A lady in Saudi With eyes that no longer see And lips that no longer speak Is available for sex With the men who created these wrecks.

Have you ever read a movie review written by a homosexual film critic who criticizes the acting of a beautiful actress? It almost seems that the critic was complaining about the beauty and not the talent. I suspect that there are many closet queers in Saudi Arabia who enjoy making life miserable for women for the same reason.
