  <h2><br>
  Saudi Arabia: Men Behaving Like Women Face Flogging</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sentences Imposed for Alleged Homosexual Conduct
  Violate Basic Rights</b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4"><b><a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights
  Watch</a></b></font>, April 7, 2005</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">GENEVA</font>In sentencing more than
  100 men to imprisonment and flogging after unfair trials for reputed
  homosexual conduct, Saudi Arabia has advertised its contempt for the basic
  rights to privacy, fair trials and freedom from torture, Human Rights Watch
  and the International Commission of Jurists said today.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Security police arrested the men on March 10 at a private
  party held in a rented hall in Jeddah. The government-affiliated newspaper Al-Wifaq
  reported that the men at the party were dancing and behaving like women.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Prosecuting and imprisoning people for homosexual
  conduct are flagrant human rights violations, said Scott Long, director of
  Human Rights Watchs Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights Program.
  Subjecting the victims to floggings is torture, pure and simple.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">On or about March 26, a Jeddah court, meeting in a closed
  session in which defense attorneys were excluded, sentenced 31 of the men to
  prison for six months to one year, and to 200 lashes each, for unreported
  offenses. Four other men received two years imprisonment and 2,000 lashes.
  Police released more than 70 of the men not long after their initial arrest;
  reports in the Saudi press suggested that personal contacts with the
  government had intervened on their behalf. However, on April 3, police
  summoned the 70 men back to a local police station and informed them that they
  had been sentenced to one years imprisonment.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Sharia law, as interpreted and enforced in Saudi
  Arabia, allows sentences ranging from imprisonment and flogging to death for
  deviant sexual behavior. Al-Wifaq claimed that the men seized at the
  gathering had been holding a gay wedding. One friend of an arrested man
  denied this to Human Rights Watch, saying the gathering was a birthday party.
  The newspapers assertion echoed claims made by Egyptian media that the 2001
  Queen Boat raid in Cairo, in which security forces arrested and tortured
  dozens, was prompted by a wedding between two men.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which reflects
  customary international law, prohibits interference with the right to privacy
  and unfair trials. The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or
  Degrading Treatment or Punishmentto which Saudi Arabia is a
  partyprohibits the use of flogging as a punishment.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">These convictions and sentences are unacceptableand
  imposing them based on the victims real or perceived sexual orientation, or
  their consensual sexual conduct, is worse, said Nicholas Howen,
  secretary-general of the International Commission of Jurists. Saudi Arabia
  is a member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. We call on the
  government to stop these practices, which disregard basic principles of human
  rights law that all members of the Commission should uphold.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">These trials violate the right to privacy, and make a
  mockery of the rule of law, said Long. The brutal sentences call into
  question the Saudi governments recent promises of reform. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
