                        <p id="country"><strong>COUNTRY DESCRIPTION:</strong> Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by a king chosen from and by members of the Al Saud family. The king rules through royal
                           decrees issued in conjunction with the Council of Ministers, and with advice from the Consultative Council. The king appoints
                           members of both councils. Islamic law is the basis of the authority of the monarchy and provides the foundation of the country's
                           conservative customs and social practices. Saudi Arabia has a modern and well-developed infrastructure, and facilities for
                           travelers are widely available. Read the Department of State&#8217;s <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3584.htm">Background Notes on Saudi Arabia</a> for additional information.

                        <p id="entry_requirements"><strong>ENTRY / EXIT REQUIREMENTS FOR U.S. CITIZENS:</strong> A passport valid for at least six months and a visa are required for entry. Visas are issued for business and work, to visit
                           close relatives, and for transit and religious visits by Muslims. Business visas do not grant the applicant the right to work
                           or to reside in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Airport and seaport visas are not available. All visas require a sponsor, can
                           take several months to process, and must be obtained prior to arrival. Effective May 2008, the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs
                           agreed to issue 5-year multiple-entry visas to U.S. visitors and students. All Saudi Embassies have the authority to issue
                           the 5-year visas, but only the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., and Consulates in the U.S. appear to be doing so with any
                           consistency. There have been reports by U.S. citizens that they were refused a Saudi visa because their passports reflected
                           travel to Israel or indicated that they were born in Israel. Women visitors and residents must be met by their sponsor upon
                           arrival. Women who are traveling alone and are not met by sponsors have experienced delays before being allowed to enter the
                           country or to continue on other flights.
                        </p>
                        <p>Women considering relocating to Saudi Arabia should be keenly aware that women and children residing in Saudi Arabia as members
                           of a Saudi household (including adult U.S.-citizen women married to Saudi men, adult U.S.-citizen women who are the unmarried
                           daughters of Saudi fathers, children born to Saudi fathers, and U.S.-citizen boys under the age of 21 who are the sons of
                           Saudi fathers) require the permission of the Saudi male head of their household to leave the country. Married women require
                           their husband's permission to depart the country, while unmarried women and children require the permission of their father
                           or male guardian. The U.S. Embassy can intercede with the Saudi government to request exit permission for an adult U.S. woman
                           (wife or daughter of a Saudi citizen), but there is no guarantee of success, or even of timely response. Mothers are not able
                           to obtain permission for the departure of minor children without the father's permission.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;A Saudi man who wishes to marry a foreign woman is required by law to seek the permission of Saudi authorities. Since February
                           20, 2008, a regulation exists requiring the Saudi man to sign a document giving irrevocable permission to his foreign wife
                           and the children born of their union to travel in and out of the country without restrictions. However, it seems thisdocument
                           is rarely demanded by authorities and in anyevent it isnot retroactive. Even with such documentation, the foreign spouse and
                           their children may still have difficulty leaving Saudi Arabia freely. Also, if a couple consisting of a foreigner and a Saudi
                           living in Saudi Arabia divorce, the foreign parent cannot under any circumstances leave the country with the children born
                           of their union even if he or she is granted custody rights.
                        </p>
                        <p>Visitors who overstay their visit in the Kingdom are subject to a fine of 10,000 Saudi Riyals (or $2,667) and incarceration
                           pending deportation proceedings. You should request clarification from Saudi immigration authorities upon arrival as to your
                           permitted length of stay. A common mistake among visitors is confusing the validity of their Saudi visa with the permitted
                           length of stay in the Kingdom. Dates are calculated in accordance with the Hijri calendar. The U.S. Mission in Saudi Arabia
                           has received several reports of U.S. citizens fined for inadvertentlyoverstaying their permitted time in the Kingdom. It can
                           take several weeks to resolve such an error with Saudi immigration authorities. You may now check your permitted length of
                           stay online at the <a href="https://www.eserve.com.sa/VVSWeb/">Visa Validity Service website</a> by typing in your passport number and Saudi visa number.
                        </p>
                        <p>Foreigners holding Saudi work and/or residency permits require an exit visa to depart Saudi Arabia. Persons involved in business
                           or labor disputes or employment dismissal disputes are generally not granted an exit visa prior to court resolution or abandonment
                           of the case. Such cases may take many months to resolve. Saudi sponsors have substantial leverage in the negotiations and
                           may block departure or bar future employment in the country.
                        </p>
                        <p>One-time visitors on a single-entry visa do not need an exit permit. Residents in Saudi Arabia who are departing the country
                           must obtain an exit permit from the Saudi Ministry of Interior through their sponsor prior to leaving and an exit/reentry
                           permit if they intend to return to Saudi Arabia. The Saudi sponsor's approval is required for exit/reentry and final exit
                           permits. All travelers to and from the Kingdom carrying cash amounts, transferable monetary instruments, or precious metals
                           exceeding 60,000 Saudi Riyals (or $16,000) are required to declare them to Saudi customs. Customs forms are available at all
                           Saudi ports or downloadable from the <a href="http://saudi-arabia.visahq.com/customs/">Saudi Arabian Customs Office website</a> Failure to declare or provide accurate information can lead to prosecution, legal penalties, and confiscation.
                        </p>
                        <p>Visitors to Saudi Arabia should generally obtain a meningitis vaccination prior to arrival. A medical report or physical examination
                           is required to obtain work and residence permits. Hajj and Umrah pilgrims should check vaccination requirements at the <a href="http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/HealthAwareness/Hajj/Pages/003.aspx">Saudi Ministry of Health website</a>. All travelers who are coming to work in the Kingdom must undergo a medical exam and present a medical report confirming
                           that they are free from contagious diseases, including HIV/AIDS. Any worker testing positive for HIV/AIDS will not be allowed
                           to work in the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia has not imposed HIV/AIDS travel restrictions on other categories of travelers. Please
                           inquire directly with the <a href="http://www.saudiembassy.net/">Embassy of Saudi Arabia</a> before you travel. For additional information, please refer to the <a href="http://www.moi.gov.sa/wps/portal">Ministry of Interior website</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Note for Dual Nationals:</strong> Several U.S. citizens of Saudi descent have encountered difficulty leaving the Kingdom after entering on a Saudi Laissez
                           Passer rather than a Saudi or U.S. passport. If a U.S. citizen has a claim to Saudi citizenship, Saudi missions abroad sometimes
                           propose to issue a Laissez Passer to facilitate travel into the Kingdom. This only leads to difficulties when the traveler
                           wishes to depart the Kingdom, however, as the traveler must first obtain a Saudi passport while in Saudi Arabia. U.S. citizens
                           of Saudi descent should understand that Saudi nationality is not confirmed quickly or easily, and documentary requirements
                           encountered in Saudi Arabia may differ from those described by Saudi missions abroad. On average, the processing time for
                           a Saudi passport in these cases has been six to twelve months. Once you are in Saudi Arabia and have started the passport
                           process, you cannot depart. Obtaining a U.S. passport at the Embassy will not help, as the Saudi government may refuse to
                           recognize the validity of a U.S. passport presented by a Saudi passport applicant for travel out of Saudi Arabia, if it was
                           not also used to enter Saudi Arabia. We strongly recommendthat U.S. citizens who also have Saudi nationality enter Saudi Arabia
                           with either a Saudi passport or U.S. passport and Saudi visa, and not with a Laissez Passer.
                        </p>

                        <p id="safety"><strong>THREATS TO SAFETY AND SECURITY:</strong> In the most recent Travel Warning for Saudi Arabia, the Department of State urges U.S. citizens to consider carefully the
                           risks of traveling to Saudi Arabia. The last major terrorist attack directed against the civilian population was an attack
                           against French nationals in 2007. Significant enhancements in the capacity and capability of Saudi security and intelligence
                           forces have greatly improved the security environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>While there has been continued improvement in the security climate in Saudi Arabia, it is important to note that there remains
                           an ongoing security threat due to the continued presence of terrorist groups, some affiliated with al-Qaida, who may target
                           Western interests, housing compounds, hotels, shopping areas, and other facilities where Westerners congregate. These terrorist
                           groups may employ a wide variety of tactics and also may target Saudi government facilities and economic/commercial targets
                           within the Kingdom.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you choose to visit Saudi Arabia, you are strongly urged to avoid staying in hotels or housing compounds that do not appear
                           to apply stringent security measures. However, please note that the U.S. Embassy cannot intervene to help resolve personal
                           housing issues. You also are reminded to be aware of your surroundings when visiting commercial establishments frequented
                           by Westerners. While crime is comparatively low, there are still risks to Westerners visiting the Kingdom. To the extent possible,
                           maintain a low profile, and vary times and routes of travel, exercise caution while driving; incidents of road rage have occurred.
                           Ensure that your travel documents and visas are current and valid and secured in a safe place. Carry a photocopy ofyour travel
                           documents in lieu of the originals. On occasion, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Saudi Arabia may restrict travel of official
                           U.S. diplomats or suspend public services for security reasons. Whenever threat information is specific, credible, and non-counterable,
                           this threat information will be made available to the U.S. public. In those instances, the Embassy and Consulates will keep
                           the local U.S. citizen community apprised through the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) and make every effort to provide
                           emergency services to U.S. citizens.&nbsp; <a href="http://riyadh.usembassy.gov/amcitmessages.html">Messages to U.S. citizens</a> in Saudi Arabia are available at the U.S. Embassy Riyadh website.

                        <p id="crime"><strong>CRIME:</strong> Crime in Saudi Arabia has steadily increased over recent years, but remains at levels below most major metropolitan areas
                           in the United States. Visitors should take precautions to reduce their risk of becoming victims of crime. Individuals should
                           be aware of their surroundings and keep valuables out of sight and secure. Items of value should not be left in plain view
                           in vehicles. It is advisable to travel with a companion, if possible. Private Saudi citizens who perceive that a foreigner
                           is not observing conservative standards of conduct have been known to harass, pursue, or assault that person. The U.S. Embassy
                           in Riyadh cautions U.S. citizens that Saudi Arabian police authorities have detained potential witnesses to crimes without
                           charges or access to legal counsel, and with limited or delayed consular access, during the investigative stage of criminal
                           cases, which can take months. On occasion, Saudi authorities have temporarily confiscated the personal effects of detained
                           potential witnesses. Even when released from detention, witnesses to criminal incidents may be prohibited from leaving the
                           country until investigation of the incident is complete.
                        </p>
                        <p>During 2010, the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh received several reports of carjacking incidents in Riyadh and throughout the Kingdom.
                           These incidents involved multiple criminals who, in some instances, used force or a display of force to carjack the vehicle.
                           In other incidents, the criminals created a diversion such as a minor traffic accident or some other ruse to get the driver
                           out of the car. In the few cases involving Westerners, it appears that they were targeted because of the make of their car
                           rather than the fact that they were Westerners. As in the United States, most vehicles are stolen for parts. If you are a
                           victim of such an attack, please see the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/emergencies/emergencies_1748.html">Victims of Crime</a> section below for guidance on reporting the incident to the authorities.
                        </p>
                        <p>Don&#8217;t buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are the bootlegs illegal in the United
                           States, you may be breaking local law too.&nbsp;

                        <p id="criminal_penalties"><strong>CRIMINAL PENALTIES:</strong> While in Saudi Arabia, you are subject to its laws and regulations, which sometimes differ significantly from those in the
                           United States and may not afford the protections available to the individual under U.S. law. Penalties for breaking the law
                           can be more severe than in the United States for similar offenses.
                        </p>
                        <p>Persons violating Saudi Arabian laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, imprisoned, or even executed. Suspects
                           may be detained without charges or legal counsel, and with limited consular access, for months during the investigative stage
                           of criminal cases Penalties for the import, manufacture, possession, and consumption of alcohol or illegal drugs in Saudi
                           Arabia are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences, heavy fines, public floggings, and/or deportation.
                           The penalty for drug trafficking in Saudi Arabia is death. Saudi officials make no exceptions. Customs inspections at ports
                           of entry are thorough. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General have no standing in Saudi courts to obtain leniency for a U.S.
                           citizen convicted of alcohol or drug offenses. Engaging in sexual conduct with children or using or disseminating child pornography
                           in a foreign country is a <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1467.html">crime</a>, prosecutable in the United States.
                        </p>
                        <p>Saudi authorities do not permit criticism of Islam or the royal family. The government prohibits the public practice of religions
                           other than Islam. Non-Muslims suspected of violating these restrictions have been jailed. Homosexual activity and adultery
                           are considered to be criminal offenses and those convicted may be sentenced to lashing, prison, or death.
                        </p>
                        <p>While some countries will automatically notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate if a U.S. citizen is detained or arrested
                           in a foreign country, that might not always be the case. To ensure that the United States is aware of your circumstances,
                           request that the police and prison officials notify the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate as soon as you are arrested or detained
                           in Uzbekistan. While staff at U.S. Embassy and Consulates General will make every effort to visit incarcerated U.S. citizens,
                           they cannot get anyone released from detention or jail.&nbsp;

                        <p id="special_circumstance"><strong>SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES:</strong> Residents working in Saudi Arabia generally must surrender their passports to their sponsor while in the Kingdom. The sponsor
                           (normally the employer) obtains work and residence permits for the employee and for any family members. Family members of
                           workers are not required by law to surrender their passports, though some do. Residents carry a Saudi residence permit (Iqama)
                           for identification in place of their passports. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General in Saudi Arabia cannot sponsor private
                           U.S. citizens for Saudi visas.
                        </p>
                        <p>A married woman should be aware that she must have her husband's permission for her and their children to depart Saudi Arabia.
                           This is true even if the woman and/or her children are U.S. citizens and even if her husband does not have Saudi nationality.
                           The U.S. Embassy can intercede with the Saudi government to request exit visas for adult U.S. women, but there is no guarantee
                           that visas will be issued, and obtaining an exit visa without the male guardian&#8217;s consent will take many months, if it can
                           be obtained at all. The U.S. Embassy will not be able to obtain exit visas for the departure of minor children without their
                           father's permission (See Entry/Exit Requirements section above).
                        </p>
                        <p>The Saudi government does not recognize dual nationality. Saudi authorities have confiscated the U.S. passports of U.S. citizens
                           and U.S.-Saudi dual nationals when they have applied for Saudi citizenship or a Saudi passport. This does not constitute loss
                           of U.S. citizenship but should be reported to the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh or the Consulates General in Jeddah or Dhahran. For
                           additional information, please refer to the Bureau of Consular Affairs <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1753.html">dual nationality</a> flyer.
                        </p>
                        <p>Saudi customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning importation into Saudi Arabia of such banned items as alcohol
                           products, weapons, and any item that is held to be contrary to the tenets of Islam, such as pork products and pornography.
                           Imported and domestic audiovisual media and reading matter are censored.
                        </p>
                        <p>Saudi customs and postal officials broadly define what is contrary to Islam and therefore prohibited. Christmas decorations,
                           fashion magazines, and "suggestive" videos may be confiscated and the owner subject to penalties and fines. Electronic devices
                           may be subjected to inspection upon entry or exit. Please see our <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1468.html">Customs Information</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Importing Animals:</strong> All dogs, regardless of breed, may enter Saudi Arabia if their importation documents describe them as &#8220;guard dogs&#8221; or &#8220;hunting
                           dogs&#8221;. Cats and dogs entering Saudi Arabia require a Veterinary Health Certificate and a dated letter from the veterinary
                           private practitioner addressed to the Director of Customs, Saudi Arabia. Both documents must be authenticated by the <a href="http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/">Department of Agriculture Veterinary Service Office</a> and the <a href="http://www.state.gov/m/a/auth/">State Department's Authentications Office</a> and attested by the <a href="http://www.saudiembassy.net/">Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia</a>. The certificate must indicate that the animal was examined and is free from disease, and confirm that rabies and other vaccines
                           are current. Information on the name, breed, sex, color, and age of the animal must also be stated. Birds generally require
                           a prior import permit issued by the Saudi National Commission for Wildlife Conservation and Development (NCWCD). However,
                           birds coming from the United States and transiting via a third country are not permitted entry in the Kingdom due to the lack
                           of quarantine facilities and the existing virus-related import ban on all birds.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Employment and Business Contracts:</strong> The written Arabic text of a contract governs employment and business arrangements under Saudi law. Before signing a contract,
                           U.S. companies should obtain an independent translation to ensure a full understanding of the contract's terms, limits, and
                           agreements. No U.S. citizen should come to work in Saudi Arabia or make a business arrangement without having read and understood
                           the full written contract. Verbal assurances or side letters are not binding under Saudi law. In the event of any contract
                           dispute, the Saudi authorities refer to the contract. Since the Saudi sponsor holds the employee's passport and controls the
                           issuance of exit permits, U.S. citizens cannot simply leave Saudi Arabia in the event of a labor or business dispute. A U.S.
                           citizen who breaks an employment or business contract may have to pay substantial penalties before being allowed to leave
                           Saudi Arabia. To change employers in Saudi Arabia requires the written permission of the original sponsoring employer, which
                           is discretionary. Saudi courts take seriously their responsibility to adjudicate disputes. This process, which is performed
                           in accordance with Saudi law and customs, should not be entered into without an Arabic translator, generally takes several
                           months, and may require hiring legal counsel.
                        </p>
                        <p>Persons involved in legal cases are not permitted to leave the Kingdom until the case has been resolved or abandoned. The
                           U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulates General cannot adjudicate labor or business disputes or provide translation services. U.S.
                           consular officers can provide lists of local attorneys to help U.S. citizens settle business disputes, but ultimate responsibility
                           for the resolution of disputes through the Saudi legal system lies with the parties involved. For additional information on

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Standards of Conduct and Religious Police</strong>: Islam is the official religion of the country and pervades all aspects of life in Saudi Arabia. Public display of non-Islamic
                           religious articles such as crosses and Bibles is not permitted. Non-Muslims are forbidden to travel to Makkah (Mecca) and
                           Madinah, the cities where the two holiest mosques of Islam are located. Norms for public behavior in Saudi Arabia are extremely
                           conservative, and the Commission on Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (CPVPV), the religious police (Mutawwa
                           or Al-Hay&#8217;ah colloquially), are charged with enforcing these standards on behalf of the CPVPV. Mutawwa are required to carry
                           special identification and usually are accompanied by uniformed police; however, in some cases they have detained persons
                           without police presence. To ensure that conservative standards of conduct are observed, the Saudi religious police have accosted
                           or arrested foreigners, including U.S. citizens, for improper dress or other alleged infractions,such as consumption of alcohol
                           or association by a female with a male to whom she is not related. While most incidents have resulted only in inconvenience
                           or embarrassment, the potential exists for an individual to be arrested, physically harmed or deported. U.S. citizens who
                           are involved in an incident with the Mutawwa should report the incident to the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh or the U.S. Consulates
                           General in Jeddah or Dhahran.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Saudi Embassy in Washington advises women traveling to Saudi Arabia to dress in a conservative fashion in public, wearing
                           ankle-length dresses with long sleeves and not pants. &nbsp;However, in most areas of Saudi Arabia, and particularly in Riyadh
                           and the central part of the Kingdom, women wear a full-length black covering known as an Abaya, and cover their heads. Women
                           who choose not to conform to this dress code face a greater risk of being confronted by Mutawwa.Men should not wear shorts
                           in public or go without a shirt.
                        </p>
                        <p>Many areas of life in Saudi Arabia are segregated by sex to ensure that unrelated men and women have no possibility of "mingling"
                           (khulwa, a punishable crime). Some Mutawwa try to enforce the rule that men and women who are beyond childhood years may not
                           mingle in public unless they are family or close relatives. Mutawwa may ask to see proof that a couple is married or related.
                           Women who are arrested for socializing with a man who is not a relative may be charged with prostitution. Some restaurants,
                           particularly fast-food outlets, have refused to serve women who are not accompanied by a close male relative. In addition,
                           some restaurants or cafes don&#8217;t have a "family section" in which women are permitted to eat. These restrictions are not always
                           posted. This is more common in Riyadh and the more conservative central Nejd region.
                        </p>
                        <p>Dancing, playing music, and showing movies in public are forbidden.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Hajj and Umrah:</strong> U.S. Muslims who plan to participate in the annual Hajj or Umrah pilgrimages to the holy cities of Makkah (Mecca) and Madinah
                           should pay close attention to the following:
                        </p>
                        <p>For those interested in performing Hajj visits, all travel plans must be made through a Saudi government-approved travel agent
                           in order to obtain entry, accommodation, and transportation in Saudi Arabia during the Hajj season. See the <a href="http://www.saudiembassy.net/">Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia web site</a> for further information.
                        </p>
                        <p>Hajj and Umrah visas are required for all U.S. citizens, and are valid only for travel to the Holy Cities of Makkah (Mecca)
                           and Madinah. Onward travel to Riyadh or other Saudi Arabian cities is usually not permitted during the Hajj. During Umrah,
                           visitors may obtain permission after arrangements have been made with a travel agency to travel to other cities in Saudi Arabia.
                           Umrah visa holders may only visit Saudi Arabia outside of the annual Hajj period. Please note that the U.S. Embassy and Consulates
                           General in Jeddah and Dhahran cannot assist in arranging such travel permissions within Saudi Arabia. Visitors who overstay
                           their Hajj or Umrah visas are subject to a fine of 10,000 Saudi Riyals (or $2,667) and incarceration pending deportation proceedings.
                           All visitors should request clarification upon arrival as to the permitted length of stay.
                        </p>
                        <p>Foreign Muslim residents of the Kingdom may perform the Hajj once every five years. Advance approval must be obtained from
                           an immigration office with the approval of the Saudi sponsor. U.S. citizen residents of Saudi Arabia must travel with Saudi-government-approved
                           sponsor groups to perform Hajj. &nbsp;Please review U.S. Embassy&#8217;s <a href="http://jeddah.usconsulate.gov/hajj-factsheet-2011.html">Hajj Fact Sheet</a> for more details:&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>King Abdul Aziz International Airport in Jeddah is large and modern, with special terminal facilities to accommodate hundreds
                           of thousands of pilgrims. However, due to the extremely large number of people arriving, waiting time at the airport upon
                           arrival during the Hajj may be as long as ten hours. Pilgrims should plan on a lengthy wait before leaving the airport on
                           their way to Makkah or Madinah. Travelers with only carry-on bags will find baggage transfer at the airport much easier than
                           will those with checked baggage. Some Hajj pilgrims now fly directly to Madinah and proceed to Makkah by road. There is no
                           airport in Makkah.
                        </p>
                        <p>Before leaving home, travelers should make at least two copies of their U.S. passports, including the pages stamped with Saudi
                           visas. One copy should be left with someone at home and one taken with the traveler and kept in a secure location when possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is mandatory for Hajj visitors to turn U.S. passports over to the tour group organizer upon arrival in the Kingdom, and
                           passports are returned only immediately prior to departure while at the airport. This is a Hajj Ministry-mandated practice
                           for all Hajj pilgrims, and it has proved effective in nearly eliminating the problem of lost and stolen passports. Upon arrival,
                           all pilgrims are issued an identification card and wristband that they must carry at all times. Umrah visitors do not receive
                           an identification card or wristband.
                        </p>
                        <p>Hajj and Umrah pilgrims have reported thefts (including of passports) at the pilgrimage sites, and therefore a money belt
                           or pouch is a recommended means to carry valuables. Upon arrival it is possible to buy what is known as a "Hajj belt," which
                           is somewhat larger than U.S. equivalents. Pilgrims should bring sufficient funds to cover any unforeseen emergencies. If pilgrims
                           need to purchase Saudi Riyals, there are exchange and ATM facilities available in the airports and in all major cities of
                           Saudi Arabia.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Hajj has been an attractive target for defrauding unsuspecting tourists. Travelers should be aware and vigilant of unscrupulous
                           tour operators who abandon tourists, leaving them with unpaid bills, and hoteliers who demand the payment of exorbitant &#8220;hidden
                           charges&#8221; for the return of passports. Pilgrims are urged to deal only with licensed and established tour operators. In addition,
                           the Saudi Arabian government has been helpful, and experienced personnel are available from the government's Ministry of Hajj
                           in the Holy Cities area during the Hajj season. Communications facilities to contact family in the United States are available
                           in all parts of Saudi Arabia. Internet caf&eacute;s are available in all major cities. Before arriving in Saudi Arabia for Hajj or
                           Umrah, establish a communication routine for family and friends with whom you wish to keep in contact. Travelers should expect
                           crowded conditions during the Hajj. Historically, temperatures in Makkah have ranged between 64 and 108 degrees Fahrenheit.
                           There are many facilities providing water, public accommodations, and other amenities. In case of emergency, Hajj pilgrims
                           should first contact The National Experimental Establishment for Pilgrims from America, Australia, Europe and Turkey -- Telephone
                           Number: 966- 02-542-7003; Mobile: 966-050-560-8150; Fax: 542 0992; Website: <a href="http://www.mhteaae.com.sa/">www.mhteaae.com.sa</a>; Street Address: Al-Nuzha District, Main Street, Makkah and then Health Affairs Office &#8211; 966-02-530-8812; and Office of Lost

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Accessibility</strong>: While in Saudi Arabia, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what is
                           generally found in the United States.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Basic Law does not prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities. There is no legislation mandating public
                           accessibility. Newer commercial and government buildings, however, often include such access. The Ministry of Social Affairs
                           is responsible for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>According to the Ministry of Social Affairs, there are numerous government-sponsored centers for persons with disabilities,
                           such as the Noor Institute for the Blind, the Amal Institute for the Deaf, and social rehabilitation and welfare centers for
                           the elderly. Note that Saudi Arabia has extremely limited infrastructure to care for those with mental disabilities. Royal
                           decrees in the past have encouraged institutions and individuals to contribute to charitable activities to assist persons
                           with disabilities.

                           or not your medical insurance will cover you overseas. You need to ask your insurance company two questions:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Does my policy apply when I&#8217;m out of the United States?</li>
                           <li>Will it cover emergencies like a trip to a foreign hospital or a medical evacuation?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In many places, doctors and hospitals still expect payment in cash at the time of service. Your regular U.S. health insurance
                           may not cover doctors&#8217; and hospital visits in other countries. If your policy doesn&#8217;t go with you when you travel, it&#8217;s a
                           very good idea to take out another one for your trip. For more information, please see our <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1470.html">medical insurance overseas page</a>.

                        <p id="traffic_safety"><strong>TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS:</strong> While in Saudi Arabia, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The information
                           below concerning Saudi Arabia is provided for general reference only, and may not necessarily apply to all locations and circumstances.
                        </p>
                        <p>Saudi Arabia recently activated an automatic traffic control and management system called &#8220;Saher&#8221; to improve the level of
                           traffic safety in some of the major cities. The system is a network of digital cameras linked to the National Information
                           Center of the Ministry of Interior to monitor traffic accidents and violations.
                        </p>
                        <p>Residents should update their personal details through one of the methods available at the following link to receive SMS notifications
                           once a traffic ticket is issued. Delay in payment of any ticket might result in doubling of the ticket amount: <a href="http://www.saher.gov.sa/default.aspx">http://www.saher.gov.sa/default.aspx</a>. Travelers will need to pay any fines issued through this system before leaving the country; this may be possible at the
                           airport but only during regular Saudi office hours.
                        </p>
                        <p>Temporary male visitors may drive on their U.S. driver's license. U.S. men employed in Saudi Arabia should obtain a local
                           driver's license from the Department of Traffic Police. Women are not allowed to drive or ride bicycles on public roads. Article
                           no. 42/3 of the Saudi Traffic Law states that a valid foreign or international driver&#8217;s license can be used for either a year
                           or until the expiration date, whichever is closer.
                        </p>
                        <p>Traffic accidents are a significant hazard in Saudi Arabia. Driving habits are generally poor, and accidents involving vehicles
                           driven by minors are not uncommon. In the event of a traffic accident resulting in personal injury, all persons involved (if
                           not seriously injured) may be taken to the local police station. Drivers are likely to be held for several days until responsibility
                           is determined and any reparations paid. In many cases, all drivers involved in an accident are held in custody regardless
                           of fault. U.S. citizens involved in an accident should immediately contact their sponsor and the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S.
                           Consulate.
