Among men they are not related to, women must cover their face and most of their body   Photo: ALAMY         10:30AM BST 23 May 2011   There are several limitations on what a woman can do in the conservative Muslim country:   1. All females must have a male guardian. Women may need their guardian's permission for marriage and divorce, travel, education, employment and opening a bank account.   2. Among men they are not related to, women must cover their hair and most of their body. Accordingly, women in most of the country must wear the hijab (head covering), and full black cloak called an abaya.   3. Women must limit their interaction with men they are not related to. Most offices, banks, and universities have separate entrances for men and women.   Public transportation, parks, beaches and amusement parks are also segregated.
