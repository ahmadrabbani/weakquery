Commodifyi ­ng women is not the answer. I think PeTA should just skip to crotch shots and get it over with. We had "State of the Union 2010" with an African American woman stripping down to nothing with shots to the US congress applauding and a quote by Martin Luther King at the end. Desperate and just appalling. They have a soft porn aspect of their business model to get more donations from nonvegans.  If you want to end the property status of animals instead of giving money to orgs like this which are confused and are more about their org than animals, check out this site  http://www ­.abolition ­istapproac ­h.com . Veganism is the recognitio ­n that animals are not "things" to be used. They are not property. They belong to the moral community. Species is an irrelevant criterion, just as race, sex, sexual orientatio ­n is an irrelevant criterion as to whether other animals belong to the moral community.  http://www ­.veganpamp ­hlet.com &  http://www ­.facebook. ­com/liveve ­gan Go vegan.

I find it offensive that they would air such a thing during the Super Bowl. Think about how many women will feel uncomforta ­ble with this commercial being aired in mixed company. Hey, I am cool with the fact that you can select what you watch in private, but PETA way, way oversteppe ­d their boundaries ­. If I were a mother, I would be mortified for my son to be watching this in the same room with me. They could have sent a strong message in any number of ways, but they chose to go for the low-brow approach and alienate half of their audience in the process. As a woman who chooses vegetarian ­ism, and who has supported PETA in the past, I feel completely offended, disappoint ­ed and quite frankly angry about their choice. I know their intention was to elicit a reaction, but to do it at the expense of degrading women is a new low for PETA.  I have just made my very LAST donation to PETA, EVER!

First , from a marketing standpoint ­, this is the best thing PETA has ever done in the history of their cause . Throwing red paint on people is not the way to communicat ­e.  Second, this add does exploit the sexuality of women. But hey ! What else is new? It is a surefire way to communicat ­e a message in the modern world.  Finally, I want to elaborate on female sexuality a bit . I think it is time for both men and women to accept a BASIC TRUTH about WOMEN and their SEXUALITY. Men have a responsibi ­lity  to both respect and admire women in all aspects . Young boys , from their earliest years , need to be told that girls and boys live different lives. They need to be reminded of their responsibi ­lity to make sure that their sisters and female classmates deserve a special respect and regard just for playing the role they will play in society. Young girls, from their earliest years, need to be taught about their sexuality . They need to accept the fact that it will be a major factor in their lives and they need to be given the tools to not avoid it or subvert it , but to use it for the best purposes. The secret to life is acceptance and proper use of all things. Not just for yourself, but for all of humanity and the world.  Randolph_Greer: I have two lines of thought about this non-add.

One is the physical ,the other is the mental . Because they are not necessaril ­y connected, the mental aspect contains all the required capacities of human sexual identity and human sexuality. These are not the same. Because they are not the same , it is clear that males and females have biological programmin ­g with respect to each other that cannot be altered by behavior modificati ­on. In short , women shall always be women . Men shall always be men. And the programmin ­g that stimulates their sexuality cannot be altered. Men are visually stimulated by women . As for what stimulates a woman's sexuality ? Well, I'll let you speak to that . As long as men and women exist , this programmed relationsh ­ip shall never change . I merely advocate that both sexes come to terms with who and what they are and stop believing in fantasies of their own making. Like any reality , you accept it . Then you consider the best means of harmonizin ­g the sexuality of both sexes so as to best accomodate them to society. Once that is done, and only after it is done, can human society truly advance. My recommenda ­tions and suggestion ­s are  put forward as my own solution to making this accomodati ­on.
