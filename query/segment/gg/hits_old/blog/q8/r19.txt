Revlon: "Sheryl Crow"  Told a story and I remember the product.  Sherly Crow seemed authentic, but the Hair stylist seemed fake.  Nissan: "Auto Claustrophobia"  Funny images of bent hair-do.  Don’t know if I would remember that it was a Nissan ad tomorrow, just remember the squished hair.  Coca-Cola: "What Else Haven't I Done”  This would have made it to the top 10 list (as well as the "Happiness Factory"), but it wasn’t a new ad released for the Super Bowl.  Sierra Mist: "Karate Class"  Certainly remember that it is an ad for Sierra Mist.  I laughed at the line: “Are you registered for this class?”  Bud Light: "Language Course”  The importance of cultural assimilation.  Learn the most important phrases as you come to this country.    Taco Bell: "Lions"  The Carne Asada pronunciation by the lion was funny, but it stretched on a little too long.  I really liked the Ricardo Montalbon voice over after being mentioned by the lion.   Most Controversial Ad   Snickers: Kiss    This will certainly be memorable and talked about, but why was Mars venturing into the whole concept of men kissing.  Some will see it as homophobic and others will see it as disturbing.  Either way, I really didn’t feel much like a Snickers after watching that.   Worst Commercial:   Pizza Hut: Cheezy Bites Jessica Simpson  No humor, forced story line, poor utilization of Jessica’s talents and appeal.   Time for a new Ad Agency:   Go Daddy: Marketing  Yawn – Another ad with the Go Daddy Girl.  How many times are you going to go back to the same well?   Most Touching Message   Frito-Lay: "Enjoy the Game"   I was really touched at the realization that we are still breaking down barriers and that this game had another dimension to it.   Best CBS Promo   CBS: “Late Show With David Letterman”  Oprah and Dave cuddling on a couch? Letterman fans will eat this one up and be talking about it all week.   The Top 10 Super Bowl Ads of 2007   And with a hat tip to David Letterman, here are my Top 10 2007 Super Bowl Ads: 10.  E*Trade: "One Finger"  Again, it was very clear that it was for E*Trade, clear on the benefits, and the last line was memorable – “Tell your expensive stock broker where to go – All it takes is one finger”  9.   CareerBuilder: "Office Jungle Fight”  I had a hard time choosing the best CareerBuilder  ad from the three, but this one seemed most memorable.  I loved the Post-it trumpet blower and the guy swinging away and laughed at the line from another combatant saying: “You’re the delivery guy – You don’t even work here!”  8.  Fed-Ex: "Don't Judge"   I clearly remember this is a new service: Fed-Ex Ground.  I laughed at I-lean, Joy and Bob, but I though Mr. Turkeyneck was kind of lame.  7.  Sprint "Connectile Dysfunction”  Nice parody on the hideous male dysfunction ads, even down to the cheesy smile at the end.  I am not sure I would have remembered it was Sprint, except I have Sprint so it made a connection for me.  6.  Bud Light: "Hitchhiker"  The first of four Bud Light ads in my top 10 list.  The benefit of Bud Light outweighs the chance of being hacked to death.  Go ahead pick up the hitchhiker, even if he has an axe.  I laughed at the line, “What is the axe for?” “It’s my bottle opener” and then when the axe man in the backseat pointing out that the next hitchhiker has a chainsaw.  5.  Blockbuster: "Mouse"  I still laugh at the mouse squeaking and being dragged.  I know it is Blockbuster and that they have a new online service.  4.  Nationwide: "K-Fed Rollin' VIP"  Nationwide brings us a very topical and recent celebrity flame-out.  The memorable thing will be people asking how they got K-Fed to go along with it.  The tag line, “Life comes at you fast” is very memorable, but I don’t if a lot of people could tell you that it is an ad about Nationwide Insurance.  3.  Bud Light: "Auctioneer Wedding”  Again, a clear message of showing the desire for Bud Light and done in a memorable way. Of the million weddings that have been portrayed in movies and on TV, they come up with a new and humorous slant with the Auctioneer as the preacher.  2.  Sierra Mist: "Beard Comb Over”  The beard comb over will definitely be one of the talked about ads and there is a clear association with Sierra Mist, even if the image of the comb over more disturbing than humorous.  And the top ad of the 2007 Super Bowl Ads is: 1.  Bud Light: "Rock, Paper, Scissors”  This one got the biggest laugh at my house and it was the one ad that was replayed several times. It was clear that they both wanted Bud-Light. The guy throwing the rock to win was a surprise and got laughs with him being hit, with his fall, and with the ending, “Low five” line.    Bud Light’s ad agency was the clear winner with 4 ads in the top 10.  They made them funny, they sold the benefits of the product, and they made them memorable and they will be, as Seth Godin says,  Remarkable .      related entries  Bud Light: "Hitchhiker" - 2007 Super Bowl Ad Feb 4, 2007 Nationwide: "K-Fed Rollin' VIP" - 2007 Super Bowl Ad Feb 4, 2007 Bud Light: "Auctioneer Wedding" - 2007 Super Bowl Ad Feb 4, 2007 Bud Light: "Rock, Paper, Scissors" - 2007 Super Bowl Ad Feb 4, 2007 CBS: Late Show With David Letterman - Letterman and Oprah 2007 Super Bowl Ad Feb 4, 2007  recent entries  Does Cuil Have What it Takes to Compete with Google's Brand Recognition?

However, there were a few more contenders this year; in particular I like the robot from General Motors.
