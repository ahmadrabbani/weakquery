Groupon founder Andrew Mason says he's pulled the ads from further circulation, and  offered this explanation : "We thought we were poking fun at ourselves, but clearly the execution was off and the joke didn’t come through. I personally take responsibility; although we worked with a professional ad agency, in the end, it was my decision to run the ads."
