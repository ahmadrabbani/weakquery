By  Erin McCarthy  |  Monday, Feb 1, 2010  |  Updated 6:45 PM EST View Comments (  ) |  Email |  Print   Tweet                 Getty Images CBS sold out all of its ad spots for the Super Bowl game on Sunday.  advertisement      CBS has sold out all of its advertisements for Sunday’s Super Bowl, despite controversy surrounding anti-abortion ads and gay dating sites,  Reuters reported Monday. The network will be airing some of the most expensive 30-second spots on television this Sunday. A tough economy didn’t stop advertisers like  Budweiser from paying for their ads to air in one of the biggest sporting events of the year -- some 30-second spots in this year’s National Football League championship game sold for nearly $3 million. The recession  did affect advertisers for last year's Super Bowl, with buyers like FedEx Corp. choosing not to buy spots. But this year, the most expensive ads have outpriced last year's highest rates -- despite the flailing economy. The network will still be airing an ad sponsored by conservative Christian group Focus on the Family, which features  Heisman Trophy winner  Tim Tebow and which some U.S. women’s groups say has an anti-abortion message. The network said it is a first step in its shift toward more advocacy ads. But after accepting the Tebow ad, the network did reject a spot promoting the gay dating site Mancrunch.com that showed two men kissing. A network statement said that the company’s “Standards and Practices department decided not to accept this particular spot.” Multimedia   Super Bowl Halftime Hall of Fame            LOOK   PHOTOS Super Bowl Halftime Hall of Fame     More Multimedia   Super Bowl mainstays Budweiser and  Bud Light are among the companies running ads in this year's game.     Posted Monday, Feb 1, 2010 - 6:33 PM EST  Tweet                   Leave Comments      Top Stories TODAY  MOST WATCHED  MOST EMAILED       Westport Football Coach Under Investigation       Ellington Marine Injured in Afghanistan      Rain to Blame for Power Outages: CL&P          Kim Kardashian: "I'm Not Engaged"         Special Delivery: 14 Pound Baby Born         Aunt of West Hartford Shooting Victim Blames Cops, School       Week 10: High School Football Game of the Week      Orphaned Waterbury Teen Faces Foreclosure    Plainville Student Took His Own Life: Report           Plastic Surgery: Celebrities Then and Now   Follow nbcconnecticut                  More news       local   Ellington Marine Injured in Afghanistan        local   Woman Found Dead in Condo Pond        us-world   Rivals' Gaffes Boost Romney    More news       More business       politics   Leon Panetta to Visit EB        business   Google Helps Local Businesses Get Online        business   Will Steve Jobs' Final Vendetta Haunt Google?
