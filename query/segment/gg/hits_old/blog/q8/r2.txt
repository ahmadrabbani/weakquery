Channel "Star Wars." "The Force" spot features a pint-sized Darth Vader who tries all day long to summon the powers of The Dark Lord of the Sith. Destined to be a classic.          Super Bowl Ads 2011: With more than 100 million expected to tune in to the  Super Bowl , mad men rolled out all sorts of goodies from their toolkit including rock stars, rappers, pooches and babes all in an attempt to snag us hook, line and sinker.  Let's take a look at what most of us will be talking about at the water cooler on Monday:  DORITOS Once again, Doritos launched its contest, "Crash the Super Bowl" which allowed consumers to create their own Doritos commercial.  Some standouts: "Pug Attack" was hands down hilarious. It featured a man taunting his girlfriend's pug with the tasty snack. Little does he know that the loveable pooch was going to get the last laugh.    "Adam & Eve" featured a Garden of Eden love triangle. Bet you can't guess who gets left in the cold... This ad proves that men love their Doritos.    GM In their ad entitled "Misunderstanding," Chevy pokes fun at old people and it's probably going to be one of their water cooler candidates. In this hilarious ad for the Chevy Cruze Eco, residents in an assisted living facility argue over what they think narrator Tim Allen may or may not be saying.

In "Love Hurts," things can get complicated for a couple and, sometimes, even a little painful. This is comedy done right - plain and simple.   In "Torpedo Cooler" we find out how a nerd gets his revenge against a bunch of preppy bullies. After all, what's funnier than a cooler that launches cans of Pepsi MAX? You're about to find out.   PepsiCo managed to land rapper extraordinaire Eminem on a cool stop-motion animated ad that uses a puppet with Eminem's likeness to promote Lipton Brisk. In the spot, he wants everyone to know why he doesn't "do commercials." Genius...   VOLKSWAGEN How do you get 5 million views on YouTube days before the game? Channel "Star Wars." "The Force" spot features a pint-sized Darth Vader who tries all day long to summon the powers of The Dark Lord of the Sith. Destined to be a classic.   The automaker also is introducing a new Beetle and here's the funky spot for it where a Black Beetle rules, runs, navigates and outperforms all the other creatures in a lush kingdom.   KIA  Entitled "One Epic Ride," Kia's ad for its stunning 2011 Optima sedan features a policeman, villain, Poseidon, alien and ancient chief travel through space and time as they try to get their hands on the all‐new sedan.    HYUNDAI Hyundai wants everyone to "snap out of" preconcieved notions about compact cars. Recognize the voice in the spot? It's none other than "The Dude" Jeff Bridges.    AUDI Not sure if the audience will be in tune with what Audi was doing -- or thinking -- in a series of ads that revolved around inmates escaping from a posh prison to illustrate the difference between "old luxury" and Audi.    ANHEUSER-BUSCH For the first time during the bowl, the American brewer will promote the imported brand Stella Artois. The hipster ad "Crying Jean" stars actor Oscar-winning actor Adrien Brody as a 1960s jazz club singer. Way cool.    Those looking for Budweiser and Bud Light's legendary (and sophomoric) humor, look below:       SKECHERS In the sexy spot entitled "Break Up," Kim Kardashian tells us why she's calling it quits with her trainer during the Big Game in front of a worldwide audience of more than 100 million people. Water cooler favorite? Indeed...   GODADDY.COM The Internet domain registrar and web hosting company enlisted Jillian Michaels and racecar driver Danica Patrick to introduce their new GoDaddy Girl ...and it was Joan Rivers. If you think she was surgically altered before, just wait until you see how they made the comedienne look for the ad.   BRIDGESTONE Bonafide hilarious, this ad, entitled "Reply All" wants us to see what an employee goes through when he accidentally hits "reply all" instead of "reply" on an email.    COCA-COLA In their CGI animated spot entitled "Siege," we learn that sometimes a little happiness is the most effective weapon.   "Border" tells the story of two soldiers from rival nations who are able to put aside their differences and, for the briefest of moments, see each other as individuals as they share an ice-cold bottle of Coke. The perfect Coke ad -- which always seem to tug at the heartstings.   SNICKERS Logging isn't for the weak. But what about the hungry and whiny? Stand-up comics Roseanne Barr and Richard Lewis star in a hilarious spot that has a sucker-punch ending.   BEST BUY This is what all the fuss what about? Justin Bieber and Ozzy Osbourne starred in the retail electronics seller's debut bowl ad. I just have one question: Why were they wearing what looked like costumes from "Tron"? Funniest line was obviously from Ozzy: "How many bloody G's are there?"   E-TRADE The online investing site once again brings back their popular talking baby (first introduced in 2008). In the ad, entitled "Tailor," the E*TRADE Baby chats with his Tailor about building a stunning portfolio.    CHRYSLER In this rich and cinematic ad, rapper Eminem helps the automaker introduce their new Chrysler 200 which, much like this spot, looks like a thing of beauty.   FOX He's back... I'm kinda stoked. Nothing like a channel's self-promotion.

The Stella Artois. WTF? that is what an Oscar winner is relegated to? The Dorito finger licker? Embarrassing. Inappropriate?  Alert us.  Reply  Post new         nyquil012   February 07, 2011 at 9:01AM  Follow    Actually, the best one was a Doritos ad titled "House Sitting," where the titular house sitter discovers that by sprinkling Doritos on the dead fish and dead plants, he can bring them back to life. The twist comes when he's cleaning up... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9eb9S9_nOU I don't remember seeing the garden of Eden one at all. Are you sure that ran? Inappropriate?  Alert us.

Reply  Post new         mark1128   February 07, 2011 at 12:09PM  Follow    I don't get why the Pug Doritos ad was so good/funny. It was meh. It's not like you didn't see that, or something like that, coming. The finger-licking Doritos ad was better, if a bit gross. Darth Vader VW was cute, and the other Doritos spot with the house sitter was amusing. Overall, ads were average at best, nothing that we'll be talking about next year, or that will 'franchise' into multiple years (like E*Trade baby). Inappropriate?  Alert us.  Reply  Post new         dawktv   February 07, 2011 at 12:10PM  Follow    Not a really funny one in the bunch. Anyone with a brain could easily see the plots unfold. Who amongst you couldn't tell that the pug was going to crash through the window? DUH!!! A couple were interesting - the Detroit/GM spot being one of them, and perhaps the Darth Vader kid on a lighter level, but overall the originality and humor was just not there. People these days are too easily entertained. The halftime show pointed out that what passes for music now is just beats, hooks, and juvenile lyrics. No melodies/structure or cohesion. Fact is, music peaked in the 70's and has declined steadily ever since.  Inappropriate?  Alert us.
