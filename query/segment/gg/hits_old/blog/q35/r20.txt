Xcobra 09-11-2010, 02:19 PM  I don't really get the runs, my stomach usually bubbles and I get bad gas. It's rather annoying. However, this only happens with milk.  ahenkel 09-11-2010, 02:20 PM  I probably am but I'm a glutton for punishment so I continue to consume it.  shortylickens 09-11-2010, 02:24 PM  Fucking lactose! GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!!! No seriously, there are few things I love more than a small donut and large milk. My life is not complete without it.  Ms. DICKINSON 09-11-2010, 02:27 PM  If you are Asian, you're under the category. No, no bathroom run but get gas, lots of gas. But if you drink milk everyday, the symptom will go away--after a month.  Fmr12B 09-11-2010, 02:39 PM  As you get older the worse it gets. I'm Sicialian and could no longer stomache milk around the age of 28. It went from gas to OMG! I need a toilet and fast! I can still eat small amounts of cheese without issue but milk & ice cream is the worst and have not had a glass of milk for the past 10yrs or so and swore off ice cream about 5yrs back. Funny thing is - milk is totally unappetizing now as my brain says yuck!  DefDC 09-11-2010, 06:02 PM  I've been lactose intolerant since the 7th grade... (and I'm now 37) I wasn't before.... Go figure! Been using this awesome product for about 10 years now.  http://www.digestiveadvantage.com/prod_adult_li.html Much more convenient than LactAid. Which also works. (If you want to use LactAid, ignore the instructions. Just take 1/2 a tablet every 5-10 minutes while you're eating stuff with lactose. Begin and end with 1/2 a pill.  I'd say I'm moderate/severely lactose intolerant. I ate ONE (real) chocolate chip and I could feel it. No gas or toilet, but just a tiny bit of upset stomach. If I were to eat pizza/ice cream without it, I'd feel the effects in about 10 minutes and be on the can for about 20/30 mins. Not fun. I was extremely miserable until I found out what the problem was. (Right when they started marketing LactAid)  PsiStar 09-11-2010, 09:17 PM  Being lactose tolerant is actually the abnormality. Search for it. Soy milk is actually not such a bad thing. Soy is supposedly good for prostrate. I like vanilla soy mild myself but haven't had it for some time now that I think about it. In fact thinking about it a little more, I used to make oatmeal in the AM with vanilla soy milk. It needed no extra sugar ... its not sweet, but for cutting back on calories ... it was pretty good.  zerocool84 09-11-2010, 09:25 PM  Being lactose tolerant is actually the abnormality.

Yup majority of the world is lactose intolerant in some degree. People who are mainly of European decent have less intolerance than any other peoples.  Sasiki 09-11-2010, 09:54 PM  Ice cream and milk shakes always give me horrible smelling gas but rarely make my stomach hurt. I just ate a big bowl of ice cream. My wife will love me tonight.  dawp 09-11-2010, 10:03 PM  you can buy lactose free milk. It's a little more expensive, but it is real milk, not soy.  nonameo 09-11-2010, 10:38 PM  soy milk = win coconut ice cream = WIN WIN  Udgnim 09-11-2010, 10:48 PM  milk will give me any of the following: runs, farts, stomach grumbles, feeling like crap I can consume cheese fine though. guessing that lactose gets broken down in the cheese making process.

Apparently, Jews, blacks, asian, and American indians have high rates of lactose intolerance. If you're in one of those groups there's a decent probablity that's what you have.  Pliablemoose 09-11-2010, 11:48 PM  Lactose intolerance is a PITA, sometimes literally. You continue to produce some of the enzyme that digests lactose typically, but it's hard to judge what the tipping point is, took me years to figure out I was intolerant, I'm a bit of an anomaly as I'm a Euro mutt genetically.  DaTT 09-11-2010, 11:49 PM  I would die if I was lactose intolerant. I love milk, and am going to go get a glass now that you got me thinking of. Nothing like a bag of milk after a night of drinking.  Mo0o 09-12-2010, 12:05 AM  Theres a sliding scale of symptoms but for the truly intolerant, it'll rip em a new asshole in about 15 minutes  vBulletin® v3.8.6, Copyright ©2000-2011, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd.
