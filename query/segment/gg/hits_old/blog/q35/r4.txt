Maybe You’re Lactose Intolerant Keywords:  lactose-intolerant ,  nutrition  Add Comment   Email Page   Bookmark Page   Post on Twitter   Share on Facebook       By Geoffrey Anderson Jr. Copy Editor    I love ice cream. Whenever I’m in the mood for a sweet treat, I head to the nearest Cold Stone Creamery or Ben & Jerry’s. And if I’m a lazy mood, I’ll eat a little of my mint chocolate chip pint at home. There’s one problem with me eating so much ice cream (aside from the potential weight gain):  I’m lactose intolerant . About 30 minutes after my taste buds get their share of dairy delight, my stomach gets a mind of its own. Although the epic sounds coming from my gut aren’t a problem in a private setting, an unwelcome gastric concert at the weekly office meeting — or on a date —  can be embarrassing , let alone disastrous.    Bloating and gas  are just a few of the symptoms that accompany being lactose intolerance, a condition affecting between 30 to 50 million Americans. People who are lactose intolerant aren’t able to digest lactose easily, due to the lack of an enzyme called lactase. As a result, your settled  stomach becomes very unsettled each time you down a glass of milk, eat some yogurt or consume anything else with lactose. All hope isn’t lost, however. Even though there’s no cure for the lactose intolerant, there are  ways to avoid turning all shades of red at the next board meeting. Here’s what has worked for me: 1. Limit your dairy intake.  This is pretty obvious: If you consume a large amount of dairy products, cut back a little and see whether you still have a problem. I used to drink two glasses of milk daily, but now I only have a glass a day — and no problems.  2.  Opt for non-dairy substitutes.  For people who can’t stomach even a bit of dairy, non-lactose alternatives for products such as milk and cheese are available. Can’t handle cow milk? Try your morning cereal with soy milk or rice milk. Can’t cut the cheese? Cheese derived from soy or nuts can calm your craving. 3.  Take a lactase supplement like Lactaid.  Having one of these supplements with your first bite (or gulp) of dairy will help you avoid any embarrassing symptoms. The problem is that  you have to take them each time  you’re about to eat something with lactose.     No matter how you choose to handle your lactose intolerance,  remember to take a make sure you’re getting enough calcium . Because you’re not eating as much dairy, you need another source of the mineral in your diet. Looking for more information on what to eat if you suffer from lactose interlance? eDiets has a  Lactose-Free Plan that includes a variety of calcium and vitamin-rich foods to help you maintain bone health while eliminating all dairy products.  Eating the right foods  can make all the difference in how you feel!
