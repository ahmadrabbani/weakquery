This is because the symptoms are similar and babies normally feel the same discomfort associated with lactose intolerance. But lactose overload is an entirely different phenomenon compared to lactose intolerance and should be handled differently. This article will throw insight on the differences between lack of lactase/lactose intolerance and lactase insufficiency/lactose overload. What is lactose overload? Lactose Overload is called ‘functional lactase insufficiency’, a temporary problem that is caused by the immature infant digestive system.   This condition is basically a result of overfeeding, which makes it difficult for the small intestine to produce sufficient lactase to breakdown the lactose into glucose and galactose. Result: Babies experience some degree of lactose overload in the early months of breastfeeding on account of â€œforemilk-hindmilkâ€ imbalance. This happens when the feeding mother has an oversupply of milk and switches sides too often.Â  Formula-fed babies can suffer from lactose overload in cases of overfeeding. Babies which suffer from the condition are often all-time hungry, and that again, becomes a cause for them to be overfed. Symptoms of lactose overload: Lactose overload, as mentioned earlier, is a temporary condition that is mistakenly diagnosed as colic, lactose intolerance, milk allergy or gastroesophageal reflux. However, there are some common symptoms which can help you recognize lactose overload: 1. Bowel motions are frequent and are often green in color 2. Bowel motions have slight to very offensive odor 3. Bowel motions carry a lot of gas, are frothy or explosive in nature 4. Baby experiences bloating, cramps, excessive gas (while feeding) 5. Irritability/screaming is frequent in babies on account of discomfort 6. Baby is very hungry always (seeking comfort from feeding) due to bowel problems 7. Weight gain is high (which is not the case with lactose intolerance) 8. Spitting up increases with infant reflux Causes of lactose overload: Lactose overload is caused when the feeding mother experiences an oversupply of milk and there is an imbalance between the low-fat foremilk and high-fat hindmilk supplied. When the mother feeds the baby, if she switches from one breast to another, there is imbalance in the supply of foremilk and hindmilk. Since the hindmilk passes through the small intestine very quickly, the body gets only little time to digest the lactose. The remaining lactose causes gastro-colic reflux and hence the symptoms. The resulting discomfort makes the baby think that feeding can set things right. This makes the baby always hungry and the cycle continues if it is fed again and again. In the large bowel, the unbroken lactose creates an â€œosmosisâ€, absorbing all the water in the intestine. Fermented by bacteria, the remaining lactose produces gas, resulting in excessive bloating, frequent watery stools and gastric discomfort.
