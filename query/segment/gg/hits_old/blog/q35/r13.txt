Right around the age of 30. And it totally sucked ass. No more Cold Stones and Ben & Jerrys. Goodbye Pizookies. Hello estrogen-laden soy milk. (Reduced sex drive what??)   To be fair, this isn’t a case just for Asian Americans. A lot of people are lactose intolerant. It affects all ethnicities and cultures. The commonly cited number is 70-75% of the world’s population. That’s a heck of a lot of people! In fact, it’s perfectly natural to be lactose intolerant. Lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose in our small intense, is gradually reduced as we get older. This reduction begins right after weaning and is practically all gone by adulthood. Bummer. So if this is natural, why would I want to be able to drink milk? I’ll give you three reasons: Cold Stones, Ben & Jerrys, and Pizookies. I have a thing for sweets, what can I say? My path to lactose intolerance reduction began innocently. One day, a friend casually mentioned to me that yogurt contains live bacteria that aids in lactose digestion. Hmm, I thought. So I did some research and found that: Yogurt contains probiotics – microbial organisms that are naturally present in our digestive tracts. They are known as “friendly” bacteria. And more specifically, yogurt contains a particular kind of probiotics called acidophilus. If you want to get even more specific, it’s Lactobacillus acidophilus. When yogurt is consumed, bile acids disrupt the cell wall of the bacteria in yogurt. This releases the enzyme beta-galactosidase (related to lactase) into the intestines, where it can enhance lactose digestion. Not any yogurt will do, however. It must contain live active bacteria. Fortunately, yogurt labels clearly list whether or not they have live active bacteria – which sounds gross, I know, but it’s really a good thing. Remember, they are “friendly” bacteria! With that in mind, I decided to try a very unscientific experiment: Eat yogurt every day for 2-3 weeks  Drink a glass of milk at the end of each week   The results? Week 1 Lactose intolerance still there. And how. I admit, I didn’t drink a full glass of milk. But the effects were the same. I shall spare you the details.  Week 2 Lactose intolerance is going away. Still a bit of its consequences, but a full glass of milk doesn’t have the, uh, intense adverse effects it once did. Experiment is working!  Week 3 Lactose intolerance… gone! Holy crap! (Or lack thereof.) Hello ice cream, goodbye soy milk! This is a glorious milestone, simply glorious.   I’ve been drinking milk semi-regularly since then, with no problems at all. Well, perhaps I’ve been a might bit gassy, but hopefully that will go away in a few more weeks. My friends all sure hope so. Fut. I can hardly say this experiment is reliable or conclusive. What worked for me may not work for you – just like acidophilus works for some, but not others. If you want to try this, consult your doctor or nutritionist first. After all, maybe humans are lactose intolerant for a reason. (And if you are allergic to milk, that’s a very different condition.) Now pardon me while I enjoy this cup o’ Cold Stone ice cream. Mmmm!

Making sure that there’s digestive enzymes in your intestines when you drink milk is all that you’ve done, but you haven’t actually stimulated your body to make more. You could achieve the same effect by taking Lactaid pills before drinking milk (which I’d recommend over your approach as the effects of this are much more reliable). For that matter, you can get general digestive enzymes that will help with all manner of digestions, not just lactose. If you’d like to continue experimenting, however, I’d recommend you try taking acidophillus supplements rather than eating yogurt. The amount of active bacteria in the supplements is much higher than in commercial yogurt, so if your theory holds, you should see a larger level of improvement while taking less. I just wouldn’t want to be around you while drinking milk…just in case.     http://www.mikelee.org  Mike Lee   Thanks for the additional info about Lactaid pills! Yes, they definitely contain more acidophilus. Yogurt is just more tasty, plus it supplies you with other nice vitamins & minerals. I didn’t say this would create more lactase tho. Not sure where you got that from… Unless you’re reacting to the title – in which case, yea, it’s a dramatic-sounding title. And for all intents & purposes, having a diet of acidophilus one way or another does “get rid of” the negative effects of being “lactose intolerant,” right?      Ben   I hate being lactose intolerant. I’m not even that severe. It’s just gas and some bloating.    http://www.mikelee.org  Mike Lee   Is the gas of the silent-but-deadly variety? I admit that, on occasion, mine are. And boy are they deadly…     Michael   Lactose intolerance has pretty much ruined my life. To make matters worse I also have very bad IBS. FML     Jessica   Dear mike lee… I am an aisan too! with lact tose and tolerency! but mine is severe… even with lactose caplets it effects me greatly… i get sick for two days when ever i drink milk… cheese makes me go to the bathroom all day… and it sucks… today i took a  lactaid and i ate some nachos… not even that cheesy and i have a stomach ache and gas.. this also affects my asma which use to make me puke everyday because i never knew i was lactose and tolerant until last year.. when my mom told me i thought she was kidding.. A doctor even thought i had the swine flu.. or H1N1.    http://me.mikelee.org/  Mike Lee   Yikes, that certainly sounds severe. I guess you just have to stay away from all kinds of milk products, huh? I’ve seen some dairy substitutes out there, such as soy milk, soy cheese, vegan margarine… Maybe something like that will help a little. Good luck!
