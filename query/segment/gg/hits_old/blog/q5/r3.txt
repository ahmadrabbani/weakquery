"I don't know him," Bush said.      President Bush said the NSA's warrantless surveillance protects civil liberties.     By Ron Edmonds, AP    "I had my picture taken with him, evidently," Bush said at a White House news conference. "I've had my picture taken with a lot of people. Having my picture taken with someone doesn't mean that I'm a friend with them or know them very well." "It's part of the job of the president to shake hands ... with people and smile," he said. Speaking in a wide-ranging, 46-minute news conference, Bush also renewed his defense of a program he approved to eavesdrop without a court order on terrorism suspects' international calls into or out of the USA. "As I stand here right now, I can tell the American people the program is legal, it's designed to protect civil liberties, and it's necessary," he said. Bush said he would help Republicans fight to keep control of Congress in elections this year. He said he's got "one more off-year campaign in me as a sitting president" and that he is looking forward to hitting the trail on behalf of GOP congressional candidates. "We've got a record and a good one, and that's what I intend to campaign on," Bush said. Bush acknowledged that photographs of him with Abramoff were taken either at White House parties or political fundraisers, but he said he would not make them public because he feared they would be used for partisan attacks. "We live in a world in which those pictures will be used for pure political purposes, and they're not relevant to the investigation," he said. Abramoff has pleaded guilty to fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy to bribe public officials and has pledged to cooperate with investigators. "If they believe something was done inappropriately in the White House, they'll come and look, and they're welcome to do so," Bush said. Asked if he meets with lobbyists, Bush said, "I try not to." He said that lobbyists sometimes come to the White House, and he has met and thanked them for their help in pushing his agenda. Some Senate Democrats continued calls Thursday for a special counsel investigation of Abramoff. Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., said there is evidence of "a strong connection between Jack Abramoff and the executive branch of government." In other news, Bush said: • "It is not in the world's interest" for Iran to have a nuclear weapon, an outcome he called "unacceptable." He said he would back a plan to have Iran obtain nuclear power plant fuel from Russia for a civilian energy program. • Any suggestion by human rights groups that U.S. interrogators have tortured terrorist suspects is "wrong." He vowed, "No American will be allowed to torture another human being anywhere in the world." • Morale, retention and recruitment remain high in the armed services, despite a Pentagon report that U.S. forces are overextended by service in Iraq and Afghanistan.
