Disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff says in a new book that the 1,299 nights he spent in jail have opened his eyes about how to rid Washington of corruption. Continue Reading Text Size - + reset       POLITICO 44        Abramoff, who was convicted for  his involvement in a massive corruption scheme in which he pleaded guilty to cheating Indian tribes out of tens of millions of dollars in lobbying fees and bribing lawmakers and staffers with lavish gifts, writes that he had “an epiphany” in prison. POLITICO obtained an advanced copy the autobiography, “Capitol Punishment: The Hard Truth About Washington Corruption From America’s Most Notorious Lobbyist,” set to be released on Nov. 7. In the 3½ years he spent at Cumberland Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Md., Abramoff says he paced the track at the medium security prison day after day, “consumed” by the problem of how government can be cleaned up. One of the conclusions he draws is to entirely eliminate any campaign contributions by lobbyists, those bidding for federal contracts and anyone else who stands to benefit financially from public funds. Lobbyists should not only be banned from making campaign donations, but they should also not be allowed to give gifts, he argues. “Instead of limiting the amount of money a lobbyist may spend on wining and dining congressional members and staff, eliminate it entirely,” says Abramoff, himself guilty of once having lavished contributions, meals, event tickets, travel, golf and jobs on federal officials. “No finger food, no snacks, no hot dogs. Nothing.” The ex-lobbyist also proposes eliminating the “lure of post-public service lobbying employment,” suggesting anyone who served in Congress or as a congressional aide should be “barred for life” from lobbying the government. “That may seem harsh — and it is,” he says, but nonetheless adds, “If you choose public service, choose it to serve the public, not your bank account. When you’re done serving, go home. Get a real job.”     « 1 2  »   52           Email  Print    Back to top Read more about: John McCain , Jack Abramoff , Corruption    Get reporter alerts MJ Lee Email            More on POLITICO   Sources reveal new details about Cain allegation     Cain accuser got $45,000     Obama’s campaign style: Go negative, stay clean     Cain lashes out at Perry campaign        Readers' Comments (52) Show the first 20 comments    JJBuck2 Party: Democrat   Reply #1  Nov. 2, 2011 - 2:18 PM EST   Sad that someone like that is the one of the only ones to get that things need to be done differently.

It is not hard to imagine that a convicted felon in prison might reflect inward and seek to redeem himself by telling what he has learned from the ordeal. I fully agree with the excepts about restricting the power and influence of lobbyist.

No, seriously. The problem with Abramoff’s solutions is that he seems to be solely focused on lobbyists, as if they’re the problem. Americans have a First Amendment right to petition their government. Lobbyists are simply people who’ve been hired by Americans to assist them in this constitutionally protected act. Not every American has the time, money or expertize to lobby Congress themselves so they hire others to do it. Everyone has a lobbyist in Washington. Everyone. Members of Congress don’t sell out to a special interest because a lobbyist bought them dinner. And banning lobbyists from donating to campaigns won’t solve anything. For example, what good does it do to ban a labor union lobbyist from donating to a campaign when union members are still free to donate? The same goes for an oil company lobbyist, when the oil company execs can donate. Trying to stop lobbyists from trying to influence government is like trying to stop water from going downhill. Not only is it impossible, it’s discriminatory.

I have news for Jack — most of us out here in the real world have believed this for years, and we didn't have to spend 1,299 nights in the slammer to figure it out. Washington politics is corrupt, corrupt corrupt.

The idea of lobbyists is a good one, however corrupted the practice may have become. As I see it, changing the way campaign funding is structured is a huge step toward ending crony politics from both sides. Politicians tend to forget that this is a representative government and act accordingly. Removing some of the self interest would bring us closer to having people represent us the right way. Not saying every politician does this, just that too many do. I dont know how sincere he is, but I dont really care. I think he's right. Besides, everyone is writing a book these days, at least this one appears to be trying to advocate some change.

Mule manure. Abramoff spent his short time in prison cooking up new flimflam schemes. Abramoff is supposed to still be in prison. His early release is because his lawyers pulled strings of crooked politicians, "Release Abramoff or he will spill the beans." This book of his is a load of mule manure and is being published simply to raise cash so Abramoff can get back into political con games. Abramoff remains well connected inside the Beltway and is pulling strings, is cashing in on political favors he is owed by politicians who were not charged with crimes related to Abramoff . Top of the list of those crooked politicians who owe Abramoff is George W. Bush. Unknown to most Americans is when Abramoff was nabbed for fraud and government corruption, literally hundreds of politicians purged photographs of themselves with Abramoff, including George Bush. Our internet is cleansed of almost all material, documents and photographs, which connect Abramoff with hundreds of Capitol Hill politicians. Abramoff is a career criminal and is an extremely hateful racist. Abramoff labeled my peoples, specifically labeled my Choctaw tribe as "troglodytes" and "monkeys". Capitol Hill politicians thought this funny, including then president George W. Bush. This criminal racist is supposed to still be in prison. Instead he serves a few years in a cupcake camp and is released early by request of corrupt politicians who fear Abramoff will tattle on them. Nothing has changed, Abramoff remains a crook, remains a racist and is still supported by corrupt politicians. There is no truth to be found in his book. This book is another con job by Abramoff to raise cash so he can get back into the political corruption game, with the help of our corrupt elected leaders.

Lobbyists should not only be banned from making campaign donations, but they should also not be allowed to give gifts, he argues." Actually Jack Abramoff now makes excellent sense--quite a change. Remember, Jack Abramoff was a Republican darling up to his armpits in corrupting the system along with slimeball, Tom Delay, still at large for the time being. Hundreds of GOP congressmen besides McCain, their staff players, lobbyists, defense contractors and the Republican "K St. Project" of industrialized graft and lobbyist corruption helped balloon all the Republican "bridge to nowhere" pork and military-industrial-congressional complex contracts. Republicans muscled to the head of the government gravy-train line like Orwellian "Animal Farm" piggies that also lead to the 435-plus GOP-approved war profiteers in Afghanistan and Iraq who posted over $60 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse while failing in their nation-building. The Reagan-era tsunami of deregulation (lack of oversight) and his "trickle-down economics led to many of the financial and corporate scandals of which Abramoff was just a spinoff and perhaps (considering all those involved) the eventual scapegaot like Scooter Libby and his outing of a CIA agent. Republicans are masters of corruption and political influence peddling. Despite the GOP propaganda, Democrats have no parallels to the entirely corrupt Nixon-Agnew Administration (both resigned in disgrace), no parallel to Reagan's Iran-Contra; no parallel to the corrupt GHW Bush Panama invasion; or the entirely corrupt Bush-Cheney neo-con-artist regime and their perfected pattern of lies. Republicans are bad people who do harm to others at home and aboard. They deserve to rot in hell. At least Abramoff had time to see his mistake, his greed, and ego-driven power politics. The rest of the GOP will discover that there is indeed a God on Judgment Day. Say hello, to Tricky Dick.

I have often felt that the problem with government and I'm not anti-government zealot, is too much influence by lobbyists. While living inSacramento a number of years back, I visited the office of one of senators. He had a note posted right on his door that told constituents and lobbyists alike that he could accept nothing, even those Christmas cookies. Lobbyists are a big part of the beas because it is so expensive to run a campaign. Even local politicians hire professionals, work that I did as a volunteer in the 1970's. Abramoff may have hit on something.

Bribery to be successful is a two way street. One to offer the bribe and another to receive it. Take one or the other out of the equation and there is no bribe. Stopping the flow of money to politicians maybe like trying to stop water from running downhill as discussed in a previous post. But you could slow it down by restricting it. AND by restricting the recievers.  Although not the perfect answer . Is it time to consider term limits? The argument that seniority and experience is important is lame. Look at the mess we are in with experienced clowns we have in office now. Could an infusion of new senators and reps on a regular basis really do worse? I for one would be willing to find out.
