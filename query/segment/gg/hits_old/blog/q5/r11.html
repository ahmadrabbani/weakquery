<br />
In case you think it's a Photoshop job, AP confirms Abramoff/Bush photo (http://blog.citizensforethics.org/node/480)<br />
<br />
Kim Eisler, Washingtonian magazine writer and a friend of Abramoff's, confirmed the photo's authenticity for The Associated Press. He said he had seen the picture at Abramoff's house.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I want to know is if I can have some of whatever Bush was on... he looks so happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The president, any president, probably has thousands of pictures taken every year with people he won't remember.</div></div><hr />

Story is: GWB quit drinking, you can thank Laura.  That may also be a piece of image crafting. <br />
Maybe he really can't recall?<br />
Perhaps that's his way of being Reaganesque. :) <br />

<br />
In December 2003?  He was high on power.  I wouldn't mind a shot of that!  You don't see that smile too often today.<br />
<br />
Oh wait...<br />

 <br />
Bush not remebering everyone he meets or takes a picture with is a reasonable notion to believe. Could he be lying? sure. Could he be telling the truth? sure.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't thinking about booze. His expression suggests a combination of magic mushrooms and percodan.</div></div><hr />
