I know that housing is expensive but what about the day to day living? eg. groceries, gas, household bills.  RE: moving to fort mcmurray by dcrose I lived there until a couple of years ago and found that housing is VERY expensive but most other things were the same or just slightly higher than Edmonton. For example, gas was usually a couple cents per litre more but stores such as Save on Foods, Superstore, Zellers, Wal Mart, etc. were pretty much the same as in Edmonton. Keep in mind that you do not have any Provincial Sales Tax in Alberta plus living in Fort McMurray, you can claim a partial Northern Residents deduction on your tax return for a small tax savings. Good Luck!   RE: moving to fort mcmurray by movingtomcmurray thanks for the reply dcrose. it helps alot.     RE: RE: moving to fort mcmurray by dcrose No problem. I lived there for 6 years and really enjoyed it. It is a bit isolated (4.5 hours to Edmonton) and has cold winters, but it is a booming and growing city. The growth brings challenges but most people are upbeat and have a positive attitude. Even in the 2 years since I left they have a number of new amenities and get more all the time. Let me know if you have any other questions. Best of luck.   RE: RE: moving to fort mcmurray by movingtomcmurray well just found out today that we are moving for to fort mcmuarry for sure and if you have any other info that would be of help to me please let me know. thanks again dcrose   RE: moving to fort mcmurray by Babcia If you want to do some web browsing, here are some interesting sites about Ft.

Travel Tips for Fort McMurray  Fort McMurray Golf Club Hole #1 by jamiesno I hope you enjoy my tips on the Fort McMurray Golf Club. I only played the first nine holes so I provided a picture and some tips on the first front nine. This will certainly give you a feel for this course. I truly enjoyed it there, beautiful scenery and course. The power cart was a luxury as well from golfing in Labrador. Fort McMurray Golf Course was designed by Bill Newis of GPEC Designs. Ranked one of the must play golf courses in Alberta by the Edmonton Sun. Carved out of the Borealis Forest and nestled along the banks of the Athabasca River. Lots of shots over valleys and creek beds. Large greens for easy shot acceptance with varying degrees of undulation. Majestic beauty throughout the golf course enhances the enjoyment of playing. Demanding tee shots from teh championship tees provide a formidable challenge for the experienced golfer. The clubhouse has a well stocked Pro Shop and licensed restaurant. The view is breath taking from the clubhouse deck. Semi-Private, 18 holes, reservations required. 6858 yards, Par 72: Source: Club Score Card. Hole# 1: A good tee shot will leave an approach shot of 150 yards to a large green gaurded by bunkers on both sides. On this course you have to definitely stay in the fairway if at all possible as usual, LOL :-) I remember by first drive going extreme right, it was gone! Some of the rules on the score card were: RCGA rules govern all play except where local rules prevail. Water Hazards: Red stakes indicate lateral water hazards. Yellow stakes indicate water hazard. Obstructions: All buildings, course fixtures, bridges, signs, paths, sprinkler heads, control boxes and fairway yardage markers - drop within once club length from nearest point of relief - no penalty. Staked Trees: Relief must be taken so that tree does not interfere with players swing - no penalty. Fairway Markers: Measured to centre of gren from centre of fairway, red - 100 yards, white - 150 yards, blue - 200 yards, yellow 250 yards.  Energy for the future...but not forever by Darby2 "Oilsands...Men and machines and energy" The area around Fort McMurray contains the world's largest oil deposits in the form of tar-sands. In fact, this deposit contains more oil than all the fields in Saudi Arabia, estimates up to 280 Billion barrels of recoverable oil, and more than 1.5 TRILLION barrels of unrecoverable oil. The town of Fort McMurray which now has a population of more than 65,000 has grown very quickly as these deposits have been mined, extracted, upgraded and refined in order to meet the growing demands of an energy-hungry world.  The world's biggest machines...draglines, 400 ton haul trucks, hydraulic shovels, cranes and loaders work 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to keep the process in operation. PHOTOS The town itself lies on the banks of the Athabasca River and most of the current mines and oil related activity take place north of the town at Mildred Lake. The two biggest operators are Syncrude and Suncor. But what happens when all the oil in the oilsands is gone???? The frightening truth is...the end of civilization as we know it. Your children being born today may never have the privelege of driving a car. I strongly suggest you read this article and some of the links in it to better comprehend our dilemma. HOW LONG WILL IT LAST? At the current rate of consumption of about 85 Million barrels per day, or 27 Billion barrels per year, the Athabasca oilsands would last for only about 12 years. There are a host of other problems associated with extracting and upgrading all this oily stuff...One of which is the need for large amounts of water (drawn from the Athabasca River) needed to mix with the crushed oilsand in order to create a slurry which can then be separated. The capacity of the river is limited and can never support more than the current output of oil. "The world's biggest trucks" The Caterpillar 797 mining truck is the largest of its kind in the world. Brought into operation in 2000, it has a payload capacity of 380 tons. The Cat 797 is powered by a 24 cylinder V24 quad-turbo diesel engine that produces an amazing 3,400 horsepower, about the same as a big railway locomotive. The truck is 23 feet from the road to the top of truck bed, and almost 50 feet tall when the bed is raised for dumping. The total Length of the truck is 47.5 feet. Syncrude now has 60 such trucks in operation. Eight onboard computers monitor oil pressure, transmission torque, engine performance and tire temperature. The Caterpillar 797 sells for $5 million; the 13 foot tall Michelin tires were especially designed for the 797, and cost about $50,000 each.  When a new 797 is delivered, it arrives in pieces aboard 12 semis, including an 850 gallon (or optional 1800 gallon) fuel tank.  With a full load, the 797 can move as fast as 40 mph on level ground. Behind each wheel is a pack of 42-inch brake discs ... 10 each in front, 15 per corner in the back. Dissipating that energy is a computer controlled brake-cooling system that pumps oil -- up to 1160 gallons of it per minute -- through multiple coolers and then through the discs. These brakes work!  The truck uses fuel in huge amounts ... an average of 65 gallons/hr ... with a fuel economy rating of 0.3 mpg. With such huge costs involved, the vehicle is usually run 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, stopping only for regularly scheduled maintenance.  For maximum efficiency, mining truck volume must be a multiple of mining shovel capacity. Cat built the 360 ton capacity 797 specifically to handle the 90-ton loads carried by the industry's biggest shovels; four scoops and the truck is full. But P&H Mining Equipment of Milwaukee recently debuted a "dipper" capable of snatching ore in 100-ton bites, which creates a problem in filling the 360-ton-capacity pickup. New models are in the works! Imagine, working 24hrs a day, 365 days per year, each truck burns over 550,000 gallons of diesel fuel in a year! The truck operator sits in a very comfortable cab and monitors the many computer controls that operate the huge vehicle. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Important Links to the oil ndustry: Life AFTER the oil crash A startling article by Matt Savinar Coast To Coast AM with George Noory George has regular guests discussing the Peak Oil dilemma.
