It is almost thirty below and it won't get much warmer from here on out. Jim is taking me to the airport and I have a one day layover in Vancouver. Most of which will be spent getting the last of my paper work in order.  So looking forward to being on the road again.

We are booked until August 15 but in fact we don't have to be back until Patrick starts school in September.  Two more sleeps!     Getting ready and testing the blog  A travel blog entry by frostyrunner  7    As we pack our bags, check our lists and get things in order it is only a week before we leave. This entry is to serve only as a test that this blog and the address book is working. We hope to be able to do some entries once we leave on our journey. Downloading pictures may be a bit hopeful but we will try!!
