      <p></p>

      <p><b>March 9, 2006</b></p>
      <p>Tom Friedman&#146;s op-ed in THE NEW YORK TIMES of March 8, 2006 titled, 
        &quot;Letting India in the Club? &quot; (see his article at the bottom 
        of this despatch) has come under attack. If Tom Friedman had carefully 
        studied the subject of his op-ed, he would not have committed unforgivable 
        faux pas, as the following rejoinders bring out . </p>
      <h2>REJOINDER # 1 by India&#146;s strategic affairs guru, K Subrahmanyam 
        (To be published soon) </h2>
      <p><b>Nuclear Ayatollahs <br>
        by K Subrahmanyam</b> </p>
      <p>Thomas Friedman of the New York Times is known in this country as a great 
        friend and admirer of our democracy and a strong advocate of outsourcing 
        of tasks related to Information Technology to India. Therefore one regrets 
        to find he chose to accept the biased information supplied by a fellow 
        American, the former Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control and 
        Disarmament, Robert Einhorn, instead of outsourcing his query to India 
        and then basing his advice on the information gathered thereby.. He wants 
        India to stop further fissile materials production in order to get exceptionalisation 
        from the Nonproliferation Treaty. This view is based on Einhorn&#146;s 
        information that all nuclear powers, including China have stopped fissile 
        material production. Robert Einhorn served in the Arms Control and Disarmament 
        Agency (ACDA) from 1972 to 1984, in the Policy Planning Staff of the State 
        Department from 1986-92, as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State 1992-99 
        and Assistant Secretary of State from 1999-2000. </p>
      <p>It was during his tenure in ACDA, China concluded its treaty with Z. 
        A. Bhutto in June 1976 to proliferate nuclear weapons to Pakistan. The 
        US formally agreed to look away from this proliferation in 1982, during 
        the talks between the Pakistani delegation led by Agha Shahi and US Secretary 
        of State, Alexander Haig. During this period Dr. A. Q. Khan dealt with 
        China and obtained the Chinese design of the bomb. According to the very 
        recent disclosures of the Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, CIA interceded 
        twice in 1976 and 1985 with the Dutch government to save Dr. A. Q. Khan 
        from prosecution. The Pakistanis assembled their bomb in 1987 and the 
        US delayed acknowledging Pakistani bomb-making till 1990. </p>
      <p>The Chinese supplied M-9 and M-11 missiles to Pakistan from late 80s. 
        Though Pakistani government acknowledged the receipt of the missiles in 
        1983 in its Senate, the Clinton Administration (with Robert Einhorn as 
        Deputy Assistant Secretary) maintained for seven long years, till a couple 
        of months before Clinton demitted office, that the State Department was 
        yet to make a determination on the receipt of Chinese missiles in Pakistan. 
        In 1994 the transfer of 5000 ring magnets to sustain the Pakistani centrifuge 
        operations took place from China. This was a deliberate violation of the 
        Nonproliferation Treaty and yet the US readily accepted the Chinese explanation 
        that this transaction was without the permission of Chinese Central Government. 
      </p>
      <p>From 1987 onwards, Dr. A. Q. Khan had initiated his proliferation to 
        Iran. Gen. Aslam Beg, the Pakistani Army Chief, at that time informed 
        two Assistant Secretaries of State, Harry Rowan and Henri Sokolski, that 
        Pakistan would be compelled to share nuclear technology with Iran in view 
        of US sanctions on Islamabad. Dr. A. Q. Khan&#146;s proliferation to Iran 
        continued from 1987 &#150; 2002 and during this period Robert Einhorn 
        was on watch in the State Department on arms control and nuclear proliferation. 
        China also supplied equipment and materials to Iran for its nuclear weapons 
        programme. The Chinese drawings on bomb design were recovered from Libya 
        and till today there is no explanation from the Chinese. While the US 
        has conveyed its displeasure to Pakistan on its refusal to make available 
        Dr. A. Q. Khan for interrogation no one has raised the issue of asking 
        the Chinese to explain their proliferation. China continues to construct 
        two nuclear power reactors in Pakistan. In India there are concerns that 
        under the cover of reactor construction China continues its proliferation 
        to Pakistan. </p>
      <p>Given this history, nuclear proliferation Ayatollahs like Robert Einhorn, 
        Henri Sokolski, Harry Rowan, Strobe Talbott and the entire Clinton Administration 
        command very little credibility in India. If China had stopped its fissile 
        material production, as Einhorn maintains, why does it not make a formal 
        declaration or join in initiating discussions on concluding the Fissile 
        Material Cut-Off Treaty? Most of these Ayatollahs have spent a lifetime 
        shielding China and Pakistan and finding excuses for the tolerant attitude 
        of past US Administrations for the most blatant proliferation campaign 
        by China-Pakistan axis. </p>
      <p>Even according to the most critical estimate by US Strategic community, 
        India over the last 16 years has built up around 95-100 warheads &#150; 
        approximately 5-6 weapons per year. India at that stage was not bound 
        by the norms of Nonproliferation Treaty and had all its indigenous reactors 
        out of safeguards. Now India will be in the nonproliferation regime, though 
        not as a member of NPT, and India is keen on cultivating the goodwill 
        of all friendly nuclear powers. The world today is a balance of power 
        in which prospects of violent conflict among major nations are becoming 
        ever rarer. But India adjoins a failing state, an epicenter of terrorism 
        which has a live proliferation link with China.</p>
      <p>India lives in a dangerous neighborhood and has to sustain its democracy 
        in a region where there are major non-democratic states that have a record 
        of proliferation over the last two decades. In such circumstances the 
        credible minimum deterrent of India should not lose its credibility. The 
        pace of build-up of minimum deterrent by India till now has been very 
        restrained in spite of frequent Pakistani provocative testing of its nuclear-capable 
        missiles obtained from China and North Korea. </p>
      <p>Thomas Friedman shoud obtain a detailed account of US policy towards 
        proliferation from China to Pakistan and through it to Iran, Libya and 
        North Korea from those who were in charge and come to hardheaded conclusions. 
        China does not acknowledge that it has stopped fissile material production 
        but is able to mobilize enough American nuclear Ayatollahs to proclaim 
        to the world its nuclear virtues. There is a Hindi proverb, which fits 
        this context. After eating one hundred mice the cat went on its Hajj pilgrimage.

      <h2>REJOINDER # 2 by Anupam Srivastava, Director of the Asia Program at 
        the Center for International Trade &amp; Security, University of Georgia 
        (E-mail to Ram Narayanan). </h2>
      <p>Friedman has mixed the arguments -- not surprising because he&#146;s 
        not a domain expert. And is relying on Einhorn -- whom I&#146;ve known 
        for years -- who&#146;s also making a selective and biased argument. </p>
      <p>Here are the problems/issues: </p>
      <p>1. Friedman opens by saying India should join the NPT. And ends by saying 
        India should stop fissile material production. But how does stopping fissile 
        production make India join the NPT? Can India join as a non-nuclear weapon 
        state (NNWS)? No. Can NPT be amended to make India join as a NWS? No. 
        That&#146;s why there&#146;s been this stalemate for 30 years. And the 
        Bush Deal found a way out of it -- by not formally recognizing India&#146;s 
        nuclear weapons capability -- simply &quot;separating&quot; it from the 
        civilian complex and making international particiption in it possible. 
      </p>
      <p>2. A common mistake: NPT DOES NOT prohibit civil nuclear trade with a 
        non-member or even a NNWS. It simply says recipient country&#146;s facility 
        in which the assistance is going must be placed under safeguards -- which 
        will happen under the N deal. </p>
      <p>3. FMCT: China has NOT stopped fissile materials production, nor confirmed 
        it will do so -- has simply said it will sign/join the FMCT when it&#146;s 
        ready -- which is exactly what India has also said. Both know that it 
        will be 3 years or more before FMCT is finally negotiated at the CD in 
        Geneva. </p>
      <p>4. By then, India should have enough weapons grade fissile material. 
        That is also why they insisted to keep FBRs in the weapons complex, and 
        build additional FBR facilities on the civilian side -- so as to participate 
        in global Nuclear R&amp;D and supply initiatives (GNEP, Gen IV etc) </p>
      <p>So, sadly, Friedman is wrong on this one -- probably because he has been 
        coached by people with a vested interest. </p>
      <p>Hope this clarifies the issues involved. </p>

        To: &#146;letters@nytimes.com&#146; <br>
        Subject: Thomas Friedman Is Flat Wrong </p>
      <p>March 8, 2006 </p>
      <p>Letters to the Editor, <br>
        The New York Times </p>
      <p>Re: &#147;Letting India in the Club&#148; (Column by Thomas L. Friedman, 
        March 8, 2006)</p>
      <p>To the Editor: </p>
      <p>The Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT) does not prohibit the sharing 
        of civilian nuclear technology with India, contrary to Thomas Friedman&#146;s 
        insinuation. </p>
      <p>In fact, the NPT encourages nuclear technology&#146;s peaceful use, and 
        embracing India in this regard will actually advance the NPT&#146;s objectives. 
      </p>
      <p>President Bush&#146;s and Prime Minister Singh&#146;s landmark agreement 
        promotes peaceful use of civilian nuclear technology, while preventing 
        diversion of civilian technology to military use. This explains Nobel 
        laureate Mohammed El-Baradei&#146;s unequivocal support of the U.S.-India 
        civilian nuclear initiative. </p>
      <p>For the record, the United States has a civilian nuclear sharing agreement 
        with nuclear-armed China. Mr. Friedman fails to explain why India, with 
        a spotless non-proliferation record and strategic partner of the United 
        States, should be treated less favorably than China. Moreover, unlike 
        Iran or North Korea, India has never violated the NPT. </p>
      <p>The worry that Japan, Brazil, or Argentina might renounce their adherence 
        to the NPT because of U.S. civilian nuclear cooperation with India is 
        fanciful. None of the three or any other NPT party has uttered a syllable 
        suggesting such nuclear adventurism is afoot because of the U.S.-India 
        civilian nuclear initiative. </p>
      <p>As regards a fissile material cut-off, India is committed to negotiating 
        this by international treaty that would apply evenhandedly throughout 
        the globe. India is sandwiched between nuclear-armed Pakistan and China. 
        It cannot be expected to compromise its national security anymore than 
        was the United States when confronted with Soviet missiles in Cuba. </p>
      <p>To make fissile material cut-off the pre-condition to India joining the 
        nuclear club is equivalent to killing the deal, and Thomas Friedman knows 
        this. If this deal fails, India will remain outside IAEA safeguards, the 
        world will be less safe, and the budding strategic partnership between 
        the United States and democratic India will be stillborn. </p>
      <p>Fifty-four per cent (54%) of India&#146;s population is under the age 
        of 25; this translates to 600 million young Indians who were not even 
        born at the time of the signing of the NPT. President Bush has it right 
        engaging India in its development of energy security. America&#146;s involvement 
        will ensure transfer of international best practices and greater safety 
        standards, while stemming global warming &#150; with the indirect benefit 
        of spurring job creation in India and here at home. </p>
      <p>Ignoring 1/5th the world&#146;s population that supports the world&#146;s 
        largest democracy, rule of law, and which embraces a vibrant and free 
        press, secular values, and is aligned with the U.S. on numerous international 
        geopolitical challenges, would prove a Himalayan blunder that belongs 
        to the round-world thinking that we had hoped Thomas Friedman and others 
        have outgrown </p>
      <p>Sincerely, <br>
        Ron Somers, President United States-India Business Council, U.S. Chamber 
        of Commerce, 1615 H Street NW Washington, DC 20062, 202-463-5626 </p>
      <h2>REJOINDER # 4 by Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, Foreign Affairs Editor of THE 
        HINDUSTAN TIMES, New Delhi (E-Mail to Ram Narayanan) </h2>
      <p>The key problems with Friedman&#146;s piece. </p>
      <p>1. Seems to have forgotten that India didn&#146;t sign the NPT because 
        it essentially gave India a stark choice: if you want access to civilian 
        nuclear technology then you must surrender your nuclear arsenal. He smartly 
        leaves out that the NPT would have required India to unilaterally disarm. 
      </p>
      <p>He quotes Bob Einhorn as urging that if India wants to be a nuclear power 
        it should do what they do and apply a fissile material freeze. Two subpoints 
        here: </p>
      <p>2. India has accepted strictures on its nuclear policy that the five 
        nuclear powers do not: Safeguards on nuclear facilities are in perpetuity, 
        the facilities cannot switch from nuclear to civilian and back. The deal 
        is not one of perfect reciprocity. </p>
      <p>3. He claims China has agreed to a fissile material freeze. This is highly 
        contentious. Einhorn himself was asked in a closed door conference to 
        provide any shred of evidence to prove this claim. He could not. There 
        has been no official statement by China to this effect. When Einhorn was 
        in the Clinton Administration he told Indian journalists that Pakistan 
        was on the verge of overtaking India in terms of weapons grade plutonium 
        production. Knowing this, it is remarkable he feels India should freeze 
        its production at this point. </p>
      <p>4. Finally, Friedman completely fails to understand how important the 
        nuclear deal is to wiping out the deep institutional distrust of the US 
        that exists in New Delhi. To say &quot;I support Bush&#146;s new policy 
        on India&quot; and then say &quot;but I oppose the nuclear deal&quot; 
        is an oxymoron. </p>
      <p>Friedman seems to have only one source, Einhorn -- a nonproliferation 
        hawk. </p>
      <p>The column only proves the axiom in journalism that a one-source story 
        is almost sure to be erroneous. </p>
      <h2>REJOINDER # 5 by foreign policy specialist Indrani Bagchi of THE TIMES 
        OF INDIA, NEW DELHI (E-Mail to Ram Narayanan) </h2>
      <p>I think Tom Friedman needs some reality checks in this world. It also 
        shows that no matter how much he says he likes india, he cannot possibly 
        make Bob Einhorn his non-proliferation guru. Einhorn is the kind who is 
        bloody-minded enough to say India should cap its fissile material, while 
        not having the balls to get China or Pakistan to do the same. Einhorn 
        in a conversation with me in 1999 actually said that Pakistan (then) had 
        more fissile material than India. Clearly, if he knew it, so did the Indian 
        establishment. But since then, India has not made a push to ratchet up 
        its own fissile materials production -- which ought to say something about 
        India. Something that ayatollahs like Einhorn will never realise. </p>
      <p>My disappointment with Friedman on this issue is profound. at least I 
        would have expected him to think independently for himself rather than 
        blindly be PR for Einhorn. And to think independently, one has to reorient 
        one&#146;s mind from the round world to the flat, and Friedman has leagues 
        to go before that happens. <br>
      </p>
      <h2>THE NEW YORK TIMES <br>
        March 8, 2006 <br>
        Op-Ed Columnist </h2>
      <p><b>Letting India in the Club? <br>
        By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN </b></p>
      <p>India is a country that had me at hello. Call me biased, but I have a 
        soft spot for countries of one billion people, speaking a hundred different 
        languages and practicing a variety of religions, whose people hold regular 
        free and fair elections and, despite massive poverty, still produce generations 
        of doctors and engineers who help to make the world a more productive 
        and peaceful place. Sure, as today&#146;s bombings in India illustrate, 
        it has its problems &#151; but it is not Iraq. It is a beacon of tolerance 
        and stability. </p>
      <p>So I applaud President Bush&#146;s desire to form a deeper partnership 
        with India. There is only one thing I would not do for that cause: endorse 
        &#151; in its current form &#151; the nuclear arms deal that the Bush 
        team just cut with New Delhi. I am all for finding a creative way to bring 
        India into the world&#146;s nuclear family. India deserves to be treated 
        differently than Iran. But we can&#146;t do it in a way that could melt 
        down the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and foster a nuclear arms race 
        in South Asia. </p>
      <p>What&#146;s the problem? India has never signed the N.P.T., which is 
        the international legal framework that limited the world&#146;s nuclear 
        club to the U.S., China, Russia, Britain and France. For decades, U.S. 
        policy has been very consistent: we do not sell civilian nuclear technology 
        to any country that has not signed the N.P.T. And since that included 
        India, India could never buy reactors, even for its civilian power needs, 
        from America. </p>
      <p>But with India eager to buy U.S. nuclear technology, and the U.S. eager 
        to build India into an economic and geostrategic counterweight to China, 
        the Bush team wanted &#151; rightly &#151; to find a way to get India 
        out of the corner it put itself in when it first set off a nuclear blast 
        in 1974. Under the Bush-India deal, India would designate 14 of its 22 
        nuclear power reactors as &quot;civilian,&quot; to be put under international 
        safeguards, leaving the other 8 free from inspections and able to produce 
        as much bomb-grade plutonium as India wanted. In return, U.S. companies 
        would be able to sell India civilian-use nuclear reactors and technology. 
      </p>
      <p>This is a troubling deal for two reasons. First, it could only undermine 
        the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Yes, I know, the Bush team doesn&#146;t 
        believe in treaties and says the treaty isn&#146;t restraining the rogues 
        anyway. But this treaty is the legal basis by which we have been able 
        to build coalitions against the nuclear rogues to restrain them from spreading 
        W.M.D. One of the key legal bases for isolating Saddam Hussein was that 
        he&#146;d violated the N.P.T., which Iraq had signed. The legal basis 
        by which we are building a coalition against Iran&#146;s going nuclear 
        is the N.P.T. Under the N.P.T., we board ships suspected of carrying W.M.D. 
        Japan, Brazil and Argentina all chose to forgo nuclear weapons to gain 
        access to foreign nuclear technology by abiding by the N.P.T. What are 
        they going to think if India gets a free pass? </p>
      <p>What should we have done? Bob Einhorn, who has worked on nonproliferation 
        for every administration since Nixon&#146;s, has the right idea: Tell 
        India that it can have this deal &#151; provided it does something hard 
        that would clearly reinforce the global nonproliferation regime. And that 
        would be halting all production of weapons-grade material, thereby capping 
        India&#146;s stockpile of nuclear bomb ingredients where it is. That could 
        be a lever to get Pakistan to do the same. The fewer bomb-making materials 
        around, the less likely it is for any to fall into the hands of terrorists. 
      </p>
      <p>&quot;The Bush administration proposed such a production cutoff in negotiations, 
        but dropped the idea when India balked,&quot; Mr. Einhorn said. &quot;India 
        says it is willing to adopt the same responsibilities and practices as 
        the other nuclear powers. It so happens that the five original nuclear 
        powers &#151; U.S., U.K., France, Russia and China &#151; have all stopped 
        producing fissile material for weapons. If we are going to bring India 
        into the club, it should do so as well.&quot; </p>
      <p>India says it needs to keep producing nuclear material to have a more 
        credible deterrent. I can&#146;t judge that. All I know is that we should 
        not go ahead with this deal until India is ready to halt its production 
        of weapons-grade material. </p>
      <p>&quot;The problem the Bush administration faces in selling the nuclear 
        deal is not, as the president has said, that &#146;some people just don&#146;t 
        want to change&#146; or that they are focused on outdated concerns,&quot; 
        Mr. Einhorn argued. &quot;People are willing to change. They want to support 
        the president&#146;s India initiative, even modify longstanding policies. 
        But they want to do it in a way that also serves an objective that is 
        hardly outdated: preventing nuclear proliferation.&quot;</p>
