                  <h4>My Work In Delhi</h4>
                  <p>Surprise! I am in India lecturing and vacationing.</p>
                  <p>Yesterday I lectured to the staff of an international NGO 
                    on challenges in sexual and reproductive health, a great experience.</p>
                  <p>Monday and Tuesday were my days to meet with the executives 
                    and staffs of various NGOs promoting sexual and reproductive 
                    health. The work they're doing in both urban and rural settings 
                    is inspirational and instructive. They deal with challenges 
                    both similar to and beyond the ones I and other American professionals 
                    deal with.</p>
                  <p>These Indian programs are often tied to work in women's rights; 
                    reducing domestic violence; HIV prevention; and promoting 
                    the rights of sex workers. One program was producing radio 
                    dramas for rural listeners, which were designed to promote 
                    discussion in "listening clubs." Several were helping people 
                    who had recently moved from village to big city, with the 
                    accompanying psycho-social dislocation. This goes on both 
                    within India, and via immigration from Nepal into India.</p>
                  <p>I lectured about assumptions that sexual health care professionals 
                    make, assumptions that client populations make, and how one 
                    reinforces the other--making social change more difficult. 
                    I talked about the need to reinvent the wedding night ,which 
                    is a source of horrible tension for both men and women in 
                    arranged marriages. And I talked about the psychodynamics 
                    of ignorance--the emotional states that must be addressed 
                    in order to overcome people's natural resistance to education 
                    and therefore to change. I also discussed the necessity to 
                    change India's cultural narratives around sexual feelings 
                    and behavior, to provide a framework that people could relate 
                    to if they were interested in change.</p>
                  <p>The professionals with whom I spoke seemed genuinely grateful. 
                    They appreciated that I had studied Indian culture enough 
                    to generate ideas relevant to their work, and that I could 
                    frame my sociological perspective in ways that they could 
                    apply it to their unique situation.</p>
                  <p>My pleasure, folks.</p>
                  <p>And yet...I couldn't escape the melancholy feeling that I 
                    was often failing in the U.S. where they were often succeeding 
                    in India (they would object to both if I said this to them!).</p>
                  <p>It was hard to stay cheerful when I observed first-hand how 
                    the U.S. government makes its family planing foreign aid conditional 
                    on following its archaic ideology that denies the way normal 
                    human beings actually feel and behave (an abhorrent policy 
                    about which I have written several times in <a href="http://www.sexualintelligence.org/newsletters/issue87.html" target="_blank">Sexual 
                    Intelligence</a>.</p>
                  <p>And I was frankly embarrassed that Indian sex education and 
                    HIV prevention programs could successfully challenge religious 
                    and political hierarchies in ways our American programs can't. 
                    Of course that has a lot to do with the difference between 
                    Hinduism and Christianity--Hinduism is a religion of diversity 
                    whereas Christianity is one of dogma--but still, whereas American 
                    progressives are dealing with decades of conservative anti-sex 
                    or anti-woman prejudice, Indian programs are dealing with 
                    centuries or even millennia of it--and they're making strides 
                    no smaller (and sometimes bigger) than ours.</p>
                  <p>My Indian colleagues were very curious about my work, which 
                    they asked about in great detail. Many had read my website, 
                    newsletter, articles, or blog. My latest book was news, though. 
                    When I told them the title, <a href="http://www.waronsex.com/" target="_blank">America's 
                    War On Sex</a>, they typically smiled and nodded. "Oh yes," 
                    said one. "We have battles here, but you have a war over there. 
                    I hope your book is good ammunition."</p>

                  <h4>Lick A Dog&#146;s Butt, Go To Jail</h4>
                  <p>If you don't already watch the Sarah Silverman Show, stop 
                    reading this and go to www.ComedyCentral.com to see when it's 
                    on next, and watch whatever episode is playing.</p>
                  <p>The half-hour show is very funny, very smart, and totally 
                    fearless. In its pursuit of tackling hypocrisy, idiocy, and 
                    plain human foibles, it holds back nothing.</p>
                  <p>A recent episode, for example, had Sarah's character (named 
                    Sarah) betting a black man that anti-Semitism was worse than 
                    racism. Another had Sarah joining this nice group of suburban 
                    women who wanted to stop murder--until she found out they 
                    were an anti-choice group who demanded she promise she'd never 
                    have another abortion. This is not your grandma's sitcom.</p>
                  <p>This week's episode started as usual, with Sarah talking 
                    to her little Chihuahua (an unusually non-neurotic and friendly 
                    dog named Doug). He keeps turning around to lick his balls 
                    while she talks, however, and eventually Sarah gets fed up 
                    with his inattention (a recurring theme--how dare anyone be 
                    interested in anything besides Sarah!).</p>
                  <p>Saying "what the hell's so terrific about it," she lifts 
                    up the pooch and licks his butt. She's not at all pleased 
                    with the taste, and that would be that--but a neighbor sees 
                    her, and the horrified lady reports Sarah to the authorities. 
                    A few minutes later, several commandos break down her door, 
                    roughly search the place, and take Doug into protective custody. 
                    Sarah has become a pet abuser, and Doug a poor victim.</p>
                  <p>The caricature of America's child abuse panic and compromised 
                    justice system is screamingly funny. It's heartbreaking too, 
                    but it's so over-the-top that we're able to keep watching, 
                    eager to see what we're going to laugh at next.</p>
                  <p>Sarah is now required to register as a pet abuser, and must 
                    go door-to-door telling her neighbors that their pets are 
                    at risk from her and should be carefully monitored whenever 
                    she walks the street. People in the local diner scorn her, 
                    and feel entitled to say nasty, humiliating things to her.</p>
                  <p>Sarah goes to a group rehab session, where she doesn't exactly 
                    fit in, either("I'm Joe, and I kill people"). But comparing 
                    herself to these thugs and psychopaths energizes her to call 
                    a lawyer, visit Doug in dog detention (which is filled with 
                    "bitches" getting humped) and insist on a trial. The inept 
                    lawyer puts Doug on the stand, and&#133;well, I don't want 
                    to spoil the ending for you.</p>
                  <p>The brilliance of the show lies in its willingness to address 
                    truths rarely mentioned, and to play them out in a real-yet-absurd 
                    way. Viewers can read as much or as little into the black 
                    comedy as they wish it works no matter how it's approached. 
                    Sarah's gay neighbors, for example, talk about a recognizably 
                    real thing--one wants to marry the other, but the guy is commitment-phobic, 
                    so he says they can't marry because of the law, and they should 
                    always obey the law. This, while they smoke dope from an enormous 
                    bong.</p>
                  <p>Sarah's closing rap about the world's need for eccentric, 
                    curious people who don't always observe society's niceties 
                    is brilliant writing--especially in the context of her having 
                    been busted for raising sexual paranoia in the people around 
                    her.</p>
                  <p>We live in a country in which people are jailed--and their 
                    kids taken from them--for things like taking bearskin rug 
                    photos, letting them run around the backyard naked, and being 
                    told the proper names for their body parts. This is no joke. 
                    Watch as Sarah Silverman lampoons this extraordinary injustice 
                    while making you laugh.</p>
                  <p>Now that's entertainment.</p>

                  <h4>Uncle Sam Wants You--to Marry</h4>
                  <p>The United States government wants YOU to get married. As 
                    soon as possible, and certainly before you have sex. It doesn't 
                    much care who you marry, as long as it's someone of the other 
                    gender.</p>
                  <p>And it's spending billions of your tax dollars to <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/opa/fact_sheets/healthy_marriage_factsheet.html" target="_blank">convince 
                    you</a> to do so.</p>
                  <p>According to a new SIECUS <a href="http://www.siecus.org/policy/SpecialReports/ExecutiveSummary-Legalized-Discrimination.pdf" target="_blank">Special 
                    Report</a>, the Bush Administration has created a "federally 
                    subsidized industry" through which Washington and the states 
                    give money to <a href="http://www.afa.net/" target="_blank">conservative</a> 
                    and <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/10/03/MOON.TMP" target="_blank">religious 
                    groups</a> to persuade people to marry.</p>
                  <p>Progressive voices decry this institutionalized discrimination 
                    against people who can't get married--i.e., gays and lesbians. 
                    But the problem with this marriage gravy train goes way beyond 
                    that.</p>
                  <p>Portraying itself as a program to reduce teen pregnancy, 
                    poverty, and single-parent families, marriage promotion leaves 
                    young people unable to make good decisions about when and 
                    whom to marry, and when or whether to have children. This, 
                    of course, is the same fundamental problem with abstinence-only-until-marriage 
                    programs: they provide a one-solution-fits-all approach without 
                    teaching any decision-making skills.</p>
                  <p>Not only do these marriage-promotion programs assert that 
                    gay relationships are unhealthy and morally inferior, they 
                    assert that ALL relationships other than marriage are. And 
                    those are MOST of the sexual and intimate relationships that 
                    Americans will ever have.</p>
                  <p>If the government's true motivation were to increase the 
                    number of children raised by two parents, they would have 
                    included support for gay families and encouraged long-term 
                    gay relationships. Social science research clearly <a href="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/pediatrics;109/2/341?fulltext=&searchid=QID_NOT_SET" target="_blank">shows</a> 
                    that the kids of gay parents grow up with the same strengths 
                    and deficits as the kids of similar heterosexual parents.</p>
                  <p>The government doesn't even care if all these marriages it's 
                    encouraging are happy ones. They just want all those sex-crazed 
                    singles domesticated into sexually-controlled spouses. The 
                    government apparently believes its own propaganda about marriage 
                    turning immoral people into moral ones. Moral ones like David 
                    Vitter, Rudy Giuliani, and Larry Craig.</p>
                  <p>Our country is justifiably proud of its diversity. It is 
                    disgusting that our government should promote one kind of 
                    relationship and one kind of family as the ideal, and give 
                    billions to right-wing groups to accomplish this ideological 
                    agenda.</p>
                  <p>Along with abstinence-only, internet censorship, hatred of 
                    contraception, and a war on adult entertainment, marriage 
                    promotion is another program that must be dismantled when 
                    the Democrats assume the Presidency in 15 months. Our government 
                    has systematically undermined our sexual and intimate expression 
                    long enough. A systematic ending of the means for doing so 
                    is essential--and it won't happen by itself.</p>
                  <p>Let's remember to demand that victorious politicians start 
                    2009 by cleaning up this immoral intrusion into our lives.</p>

                  <a name="four"></a> 
                  <h4>Rocky Raccoon and Gideon&#146;s Bible</h4>
                  <p>It's an official trend: upscale hotels are removing their 
                    in-room Bibles, often replacing them with "intimacy kits" 
                    containing condoms.</p>
                  <p>The American Family Association, noting that the number of 
                    luxury hotels with in-room Bibles has dropped 18% since 2001, 
                    is predictably outraged: "Without action now, it is simply 
                    a matter of time before other chains remove the Bibles."</p>
                  <p>And the problem with that is&#133;what?</p>
                  <p>The AFA <a href="http://www.afa.net/emails/transform.asp?x=hotels_111407&s=browser&y=2007&m=11" target="_blank">press 
                    release</a> is just the latest reminder by the religious-industrial 
                    complex: organized religion deserves special privileges everywhere. 
                    Why a religious text in every hotel room? And why a Christian 
                    one? As the Sofitel chain explains, they're removing Bibles 
                    because guests are asking for other religious texts. This 
                    threatens to dwarf the whole smoking/non-smoking room thing; 
                    "will that be a Bible room, Koran room, Book of Mormon room?" 
                    Knowing the sex habits of many tired travelers, perhaps hotels 
                    should offer the Tibetan Book of the Dead.</p>
                  <p>Of course, it's exactly the AFA and their fellows (Concerned 
                    Women for America, Family Research Council, etc.) who <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/08/23/activists_target_hotel_porn/" target="_blank">demand</a> 
                    that hotels eliminate pay-per-view in-room porn. <a href="http://www.sexualintelligence.org/newsletters/issue79.html#three" target="_blank">They 
                    say</a> people just can't ignore the stuff, which apparently 
                    leads viewers to rape, murder, and pillage.</p>
                  <p>Of course, many people are offended by finding an unwanted 
                    Christian Bible in their hotel room. They are supposed to 
                    just ignore it and celebrate America's religious diversity, 
                    while anti-porn crusaders can't imagine anyone just ignoring 
                    the in-room porn that a person has to pay for. What hypocrites. 
                    What a disgusting, patronizing view of human beings these 
                    "decency" groups have.</p>
                  <p>I guess atheists' ability to resist the sex and violence 
                    in the Bible (for free) is better than the sex-o-phobes' ability 
                    to resist it on-screen (for ten bucks).</p>
                  <p>Suggestion: keep the Bible (and dozens of other religious 
                    texts) in hotel rooms, but charge for them, like hotels do 
                    for porn or diet coke. And as with porn and diet coke, people 
                    can bring their own; pay for them; or do without. This would 
                    put the Good Book on a level playing field with the Good Orgasm.</p>
                  <p>In case you're interested, this week marked the 99th anniversary 
                    of Gideons International placing their first Bible in a hotel 
                    room. For all their effort, I don't notice the world becoming 
                    a better place, although hotel rooms have gotten much better.</p>
                  <p>Anyway, why regret replacing Bibles with condoms? Despite 
                    their claims, Bibles are obviously not preventing unwanted 
                    pregnancies. Condoms do. And we all want that, right?</p>

                  <a name="five"></a> 
                  <h4>Ending the Scourge of Strip Clubs</h4>
                  <p>Sarasota County, Florida is the latest community to realize 
                    that destroying the U.S. Constitution is a small price to 
                    pay for protection from the scourge of strip clubs.</p>
                  <p>The County--inundated with exactly one club--has decided 
                    that adults watching other adults take off their clothes is 
                    bad for people. Not just bad for the strippers (who are otherwise 
                    considered Trash); not just bad for those watching them (otherwise 
                    known as Perverts); but for every one of the 379,000 residents 
                    (better known as Good People Who Deserve Protection).</p>
                  <p>The County is attempting to pass an ordinance that restricts 
                    what dancers can do, when they can do it, where they can do 
                    it, and how much they must wear while doing it--restrictions 
                    so radical that they will eliminate strip clubs.</p>
                  <p>A country bumpkin might ask the County, "um, what's the problem 
                    yer fixin'?" A city slicker might ask, "um, aren't Americans 
                    allowed to do what they want in private?" This shows just 
                    how much the exotic dance industry and their fancy lawyers 
                    have confused people.</p>
                  <p>The County doesn't need to <b>show</b> that there's a problem--the 
                    new ordinance says in black and white, "The Board of Commissioners 
                    <b>finds</b> that sexually oriented businesses are associated 
                    with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects," such as 
                    "lewdness, litter, and the potential spread of disease," along 
                    with various crimes. It's a good thing the Board can <b>declare</b> 
                    that there's a problem, because the police can't <b>document</b> 
                    a problem.</p>
                  <p>Since some local people don't want their neighbors looking 
                    at naked ladies they're not married to, the County has decided 
                    that those neighbors have no rights to their private shows, 
                    and that nobody has the right to make a living taking off 
                    their clothes for strangers.</p>
                  <p>And that's that.</p>
                  <p>Some people are smart enough to want constitutional rights 
                    that their neighbors approve of. Rights to stuff like going 
                    to college football games (where girls get assaulted) or bars 
                    (at which people get drunk and then drive home). The police 
                    do have data on how dangerous those activities are, you know.</p>
                  <p>Well, those people just better hope that the County doesn't 
                    decide that their entertainment is bad for other people. In 
                    which case the Constitution won't apply to them anymore, either.</p>
                  <p>That's what you call law and order.</p>

                  <a name="six"></a> 
                  <h4>Parents, Porn Isn't the Problem</h4>
                  <p>If porn were the problem, we'd all be in big trouble. Because 
                    there's more porn out there than ever.</p>
                  <p>And there's more porn hysteria than ever. It's a PornPanic, 
                    fed by a 24/7 machine of "morality" groups, crime shows, right 
                    wing talk shows, misguided neo-feminists, and everyday wives 
                    and husbands whose relationships are struggling while porn 
                    sites prosper.</p>
                  <p>For example, America just finished <a href="http://www.moralityinmedia.org/Newsletter/julaugsep07.pdf" target="_blank">WRAP</a>--White 
                    Ribbon Against Pornography Week. (It used to be Pornography 
                    Awareness Week, until porn retailers started using it as a 
                    marketing slogan to increase sales. Now that's guerrilla theatre 
                    worthy of Paul <a href="http://www.paulkrassner.com/" target="_blank">Krassner</a>.)</p>
                  <p>Like all anti-porn efforts, WRAP's goal is to scare people, 
                    especially parents, about the monster stalking the nation--porn--and 
                    the damage it supposedly does. Last week, co-sponsor Morality 
                    in Media (MIM) presented a typical creative mix of fact and 
                    fiction:</p>
                  <p>* MIM Facts:<br>
                    Porn is almost everywhere, lots of people consume it, and 
                    many couples with poor sexual relationships contain a man 
                    who looks at porn.<br>
                    Yes, those are true. So?</p>
                  <p>* MIM Fictions:<br>
                    Men who look at porn commit sexual violence against women 
                    and children; men in terrific relationships get seduced away 
                    by porn; most porn portrays violence; looking at porn makes 
                    men think bad things about women.<br>
                    No, those are lies. Not opinions--lies.</p>
                  <p>Anti-porn forces are particularly dangerous when they talk 
                    about kids' exposure to porn. There is NO evidence that seeing 
                    naked breasts or couples having sex is bad for kids; there's 
                    even less evidence that seeing pictures of such things is 
                    bad for kids. Four generations of European children have spent 
                    every summer at topless beaches and seen sex on TV, and they're 
                    not any worse off than our kids, who are obsessively shielded 
                    from even glancing at nipples.</p>
                  <p>So--parents, is porn a danger to your kids?</p>
                  <p>No.</p>
                  <p>Unless kids are told that they're bad or endangered if they 
                    stumble onto porn, seeing it won't hurt them. If they're really 
                    young they'll ignore it; middle-schoolers will quickly get 
                    bored with it; older teens will get titillated or turned off, 
                    and get on with the rest of their cultural lives--celphones, 
                    tattoos, fashion, and that noise they call music.</p>
                  <p>Here's what dangerous to your kids:<br>
                    * Kids being told their sexuality is bad<br>
                    * Kids being told they shouldn't talk about sex<br>
                    * Kids being told that God or Jesus or you know and judge 
                    their sexual fantasies<br>
                    * Kids being told that condoms don't work<br>
                    * Kids being told there are lots of bad people out there who 
                    want to kidnap them and touch their private zones</p>
                  <p>These dangers aren't theoretical--they're real. They lead 
                    to shame, guilt, anger, confusion, and dread. And those lead 
                    to unwanted pregnancy, fear of intimacy, inability to communicate, 
                    and a belief that sexuality is a problem that's going to undermine 
                    their lives.</p>
                  <p>And they lead to one more danger: parents who don't want 
                    to talk to their kids honestly about sex, because they feel 
                    panicked about the whole subject.</p>
                  <p>There are predators out there, people who want to hurt others. 
                    Fortunately, there aren't very many. Of course, when CNN, 
                    FoxNews, night-time TV dramas, and your local paper focus 
                    obsessively on sex crimes, it's hard to remember that there 
                    aren't that many.</p>
                  <p>And it's hard to remember that the rate of sex crimes in 
                    the U.S. has gone<i> <b>down</b> every year since 1993</i>.</p>
                  <p><i>It's scary to think that most adults who sexualize children 
                    are<b> known</b> </i>to the kids. They're not strangers standing 
                    on street corners with candy. And they're not in internet 
                    chatrooms posing at teens.</p>
                  <p>They're people trusted by both parents and kids.</p>
                  <p>It's so scary to think about this one fact, that most parents 
                    would rather focus on scary strangers--who pose very little 
                    real threat at all.</p>
                  <p>Actually, it's not kids who are the most vulnerable here. 
                    It's scared parents who are the most vulnerable to being hurt 
                    by strangers--like the anti-porn, anti-sex people behind WRAP, 
                    who make their living lying to and scaring parents.</p>
                  <p>Scaring parents out of nourishing their kids with information, 
                    reassurance, and protection from anti-sex propaganda--now 
                    <b><i>that's</i></b><i> really dangerous</i>.</p>
