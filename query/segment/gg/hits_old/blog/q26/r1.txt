Armed with a maturity well beyond her years and a subtle sexuality that creeps up on you (it emerged full force in  Closer ), Portman has become one of the most coveted and successful actresses in Hollywood. The Harvard grad can do big-budget blockbusters ( Star Wars ,  V For Vendetta ) and character-driven dramas ( The Other Boleyn Girl ,  Brothers ) with equal amounts of ease, and has managed to avoid scandal and tabloid overkill despite living in the public eye since she was just 12 years old. And just when Portman’s star couldn’t possibly get any brighter, she goes ahead and wins a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar for her harrowing portrayal of a ballerina in crisis in  Darren Aronofsky ’s psychosexual masterpiece,  Black Swan .     Related Video :  Life Would Be Boring Without Natalie Portman   Natalie Portman Quote " Young actors often don't think of the consequences of doing nudity or sex scenes. They want the role so badly that they agree to be exploited, and then end up embarrassing family, friends and even strangers. "   88  Sex Appeal OK, this may be a little TMI (that’s webspeak for "too much information"), but when we were teenagers, we taped a young Natalie Portman’s appearance on  David Letterman and watched it over and over again in our parents' basement. Sad, we know, but such is the power of one of the most beguiling women to ever grace the silver screen. Even from a young age, in films like  The Professional and  Beautiful Girls , Portman was an object of desire (in those cases for men many years her senior). Now, at (almost) 30 and pregnant, Portman is a picture of grace and intelligence (Harvard!), and can exude a hypersexuality that most women spend their entire lives trying to achieve. The actress is notoriously private and has kept alleged relationships with the likes of  Jude Law ,  Jake Gyllenhaal ,  Gael Garcia Bernal , and  Devendra Banhart tightly under wraps, and we like it that way. The fewer boyfriends we know about, the less hate mail we have to write.  When Portman recently revealed that she was engaged to and pregnant with the child of her  Black Swan costar -- world-renowned ballet dancer and choreographer Benjamin Millepied -- it was like someone gave us a back rub and a punch to the gut simultaneously. We were at once consumed with jealousy and genuinely happy that Portman, whom we named as one of our  99 Most Desirable Women of 2011 , had finally found happiness. Portman gave birth to a boy in June of 2011.    90 Success The levels of success that Natalie Portman has achieved as an actress are astonishing, really. Her roles as Darth Vader’s lady love in  George Lucas ’ three-part companion to the original  Star Wars trilogy is well documented; her Golden Globe-winning, Academy Award-nominated performance in  Closer is not soon to be forgotten; and her Oscar-winning role for leading lady in  Black Swan is one for the ages. She’s acted for the likes of  Woody Allen in  Everyone Says I Love You , Wong Kar Wai in  My Blueberry Nights , Anthony Minghella in  Cold Mountain , and  Tim Burton in  Mars Attacks! But more important than her triumphs on screen and on stage (she starred in Broadway productions of  The Seagull and  The Diary of Anne Frank ) is the life she’s cultivated off screen. Rather than succumb to the temptations that befall most child stars, Portman has developed into a passionate, caring and intelligent young woman. Her Harvard degree speaks for itself, and instead of resting on the laurels of celebrity, Portman has actively campaigned for a variety of environmental and political causes, including animal rights (she was voted PETA’s sexiest vegetarian in 2002), microfinancing in underdeveloped countries and democratic candidates  John Kerry and  Barack Obama . But despite all her past success, nothing can top Portman’s 2010, which saw her star in Darren Aronofsky’s sinister ballet thriller  Black Swan , with a performance that has earned her every major acting award out there, including a Golden Globe  and  Academy Award for Best Actress. With a healthy relationship and a new baby, the only way things could get better for Portman is if, well... They probably can’t get any better, come to think of it.   Natalie Portman Biography    Though Natalie Portman (born Natalie Hershlag) was born in Jerusalem, her family moved to the United States when she was just 3 in order for her father to continue his career in medicine. By 1988, her family had settled in Long Island, and Portman, who has always felt a close tie to her Jewish roots, attended Solomon Schechter Day School of Glen Cove, New York, and graduated from Syosset High School. When she was 11, Portman was discovered in a New York pizza joint by a modeling scout, but her true passion was acting, a love affair she developed while attending the exclusive Stagedoor Manor Performing Camp for three summers.  Natalie Portman’s Film Career Kicks Off With The Professional When Luc Besson cast a 12-year-old girl with no film acting experience named Natalie Hershlag in his film  The Professional  (aka Leon ), he couldn’t have foreseen that he was launching the career of one of the most celebrated young actresses of our generation. But that’s exactly what happened. As soon as the precocious girl walked into the frame of the slick urban thriller -- about an assassin who befriends a young girl -- a star was born. The film was a roaring success and has since become a cult classic, but some critics took issue with a such a young girl taking part in such an extremely violent film. Still, Portman had emerged a star and used her unusual maturity to land roles in Michael Mann’s  Heat , Ted Demme’s  Beautiful Girls , Woody Allen’s Everyone Says I Love You , and Tim Burton’s  Mars Attacks! Not too shabby for the start of a career.  Natalie Portman Is Indoctrinated Into The Star Wars Universe Before George Lucas cast Natalie Portman to play Padme Amidala in  Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace , the actress had not even seen one of the previous three films. Still, by signing on to the project (and its two sequels) -- by far one of the most highly anticipated movie events in history -- Portman cemented a place on the wall of your parents’ basements for all time. Though the films were box-office juggernauts, stiff dialogue and lazy storytelling couldn’t save them from critical and audience backlash. Though Portman had entered the world of blockbuster filmmaking with a bang, fans couldn’t help but wonder if her talents would be better served elsewhere.  Natalie Portman Charms Our Pants Off In Garden State Though she already earned a Golden Globe nomination for her turn in  Anywhere But Here and portrayed a teenage mother in  Where The Heart Is , audiences still longed to see Natalie Portman in a role that utilized her charming girl-next-door appeal. In walked  Zach Braff , who, with his ode to family, coming home and New Jersey, made Portman the apple of every headphone-wearing hipster’s eye. After watching  Garden State , in which Portman literally plays a girl next door, it was impossible not to crush on the enchanting actress.  Natalie Portman Stars In Closer Proof that Natalie Portman had finally reached the pinnacle of superstardom was in director  Mike Nichols ’ decision to cast her alongside  Julia Roberts ,  Clive Owen and Jude Law in the steamy drama  Closer . As one-quarter of the sexiest foursome to hit the screen since Screech did those three chicks and taped it, Portman stripped her way to a Golden Globe for best supporting actress and an Oscar nod to boot. Officially on Hollywood’s exclusive A-list, Portman had her choice of films, and she ran the gamut in both size and scope. From big-budget blowouts like  V For Vendetta  and  Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium , arty indies like  My Blueberry Nights and  The Darjeeling Limited and pensive period pieces like  Goya’s Ghosts and The Other Boleyn Girl , Portman was proving that no matter what the script called for, she was game. Except nudity, of course. To this day, Portman has yet to show us the goods on screen (save for a brief butt appearance in  Wes Anderson ’s short film  Hotel Chevalier ).  Natalie Portman Stars In Black Swan The moment the first images of Natalie Portman’s painted white face and red, searing eyes hit the web, Darren Aronofsky’s erotic ballet thriller  Black Swan became one of the most anticipated films of the year. After it premiered at Venice, Telluride and Toronto, buzz surrounding the film reached a fever pitch, with Portman’s devastating portrayal of a ballerina come undone attracting the majority of the attention. Well, this indie film shot on a shoestring budget earned nominations for every major award, including an Academy Award for Best Picture. But at the heart of the film is Portman’s bravura performance as Nina, a fragile ballerina who descends into madness with the help of a mysterious rival ( Mila Kunis ) and a sleazy choreographer ( Vincent Cassel ). Portman trained intensely for a year leading up to the shooting of the film, and it shows in her eerily intense performance. Already with 21 awards to her name, including a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama, Portman earned her first Oscar for Best Actress.  Natalie Portman dodges black swan controversy In early 2011, Natalie Portman was thrown into the center of numerous controversies. In January, she became the new face of Dior in the Miss Dior Cherie ad campaign. One month later, a video of Dior designer John Galliano's anti-Semitic rant surfaced online, and Portman released a statement condemning Galliano's actions, specifying that she was "shocked and disgusted," and that as a proud Jewish woman, she refused to associate herself with him from that point on. Since the Miss Dior Cherie ad campaign was set to officially launch two days after the video surfaced, Dior was forced to take legal action to work out a settlement in order to keep Portman as a spokesperson. Galliano was fired on March 1, 2011, and the ad campaign launched as originally planned.  In early April, Portman's  Black Swan  dancing double, Sarah Lane, came out to say that the public had been misled about how much dancing Portman did in the film and stated that she did the work that won Portman a best-actress Oscar for her starring role. While the back-and-forth surrounding the controversy continues, Darren Aronofsky said in a statement put out by Fox Searchlight, the studio behind  Black Swan , "I had my editor count shots. There are 139 dance shots in the film. One hundred and one are Natalie Portman untouched; 28 are her dance double Sarah Lane. If you do the math, that's 80% Natalie Portman."   Regardless of who danced what, Portman has positioned herself to be at the forefront of our collective radar for the distant future. And yes, that’s a very good thing. Up Next For Natalie Portman Natalie Portman is officially in her comfort zone. After basking in the effervescent glow of awards season domination, Portman seems to have everything going her way. This year, Portman also starred in David Gordon Green’s medieval stoner comedy (no, we’re not kidding)  Your Highness , the romantic comedy  No Strings Attached  and Kenneth Branagh’s  Thor . She's also going to be adding "producer" to her resume, with upcoming films  Best Buds  (2014) and  Booksmart  (2015).  natalie portman's baby name In June of 2011, Natalie Portman gave birth to a baby boy. Although Portman hasn't officially released a statement about the baby's name, rumor has it that she and the baby's father, Benjamin Millepied, named their son Alef, after the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet.
