Does not compute.    [Image via    Robot Living   ] Coulter writes  IF NOT ROMNEY, WHO? IF NOT NOW, WHEN?  which is not so much a positive case for Romney as much as a complaint that Newt Gingrich has not been sufficiently conservative over the years. Perhaps Ann can make the case, but before Mitt Romney set his sights on the White House in 2005, just how conservative was he? I think highly of Ann Coulter (and have plugged her fantastic book  Demonic numerous times on this site) but witness this particular piece of incoherence: The mainstream media keep  pushing alternatives to Mitt Romney ... because they are  terrified of running against him...  Just how "terrified" are the MSM that Romney will win the nomination? So much so, according to Ann, that they are holding back on news stories that can damage him until after he does: As we've known for years, his negatives are: Romneycare and Mormonism.  We look forward with cheery anticipation to an explosion of news stories on some of the stranger aspects of Mormonism.  The articles have already been written, but they're not scheduled for release until the day Romney wraps up the nomination.  Huh? Which is it? The MSM want Mitt Romney to be the nominee or they don't? Coulter argues both. Furthermore, I'd also like to know what makes Ann Coulter believe that the MSM has "pushed" any Republican candidate. That's seriously laughable. The MSM long knives of personal destruction have been directed towards every contender just as they began to ascend ... everyone, that is, except Romney. Does she not remember the liberal attacks: Bachmann (ditzy Palinesque light-weight), Perry (father's hunting land's prior name), Cain (sexual harassment allegations), Gingrich (prior divorces).  So why aren't the MSM taking the long knives to Mitt Romney? There are plenty of opportunities if they truly feared him: ObamneyCare, endless flip-flops, Bain Capital exposés, Mormonism. The reason is simple: The MSM believes Mitt Romney is the John McCain of 2012. Coulter's endorsement of Mitt Romney strikes me as a bizarre and unforced (and huge) error. Is it possible that the hackers who broke into Anthony Weiner's  Twitter account also hacked Ann Coulter's column?
