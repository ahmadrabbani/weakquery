Coulter has ourtraged and offended many Democrats and even some Republicans in the past, with comments linking Occupy Wall Street to Nazis, urging the assassination and Christian conversion of all Muslim leaders, and once telling a gathering of gay conservatives that "marriage is not a 'civil right'--you're not black."

On Joy Behar's HLN show last night, the host challenged Coulter's remarks. Quoting Coulter's comments, which included the statement "to become a black Republican you don't just roll into it... you have thought everything through," Behar took issue with the conservative author's characterization of black conservatives as "more impressive," and the implication that voting for the GOP made someone a better voice for the black community. "Are you saying," Behar asked Coulter, "that all the African-Americans that vote for Democrats are stupid?" Coulter, however, refused to back down from her comments, repeating many of them and embroidering her remarks with more observations on black conservatives and liberals. "Yes," Coulter emphasized when Behar mentioned the "our blacks are better comment." Answering Behar on blacks who vote for the Democratic Party meanwhile, Coulter replied that the issue was how conservative blacks are portrayed: "Google Maxine Waters, Cynthia McKinney, John Conyers," she said, "and then Google Allen West, Michael Steele or Herman Cain." Coulter went on, however, to repeat her comments on Joy Behar's HLN show. "Ours  are  more impressive. There's no question about it," an increasingly testy Coulter told the equally angry CNN host, before saying that liberals were "vicious" in their attacks and that Cain is a real threat to Obama. "A conservative black is a massive threat to the entire liberal establishment," Coulter said, "and this is a smart, powerful black."
