After lying through her perfect, shiny-white teeth about triple-amputee War Hero Max Cleland, she's moved onto spewing her vile, poisonous hate-speech in an insane obloquy against anyone who saw right through that Nazi propaganda film,  The Passion of the Christ .  Sure, I know there are a few uneducated cons reading this blog who are so horny for this barbie-doll that she can do no wrong. You're so blinded by hatred that you ignore simple logic and reason, but I will nonetheless expose her for the lying demagogue that she is. Let's take apart her recent column, piece by piece, shooting down her lies with cold, hard facts, shall we? LIE: "WILLIAM SAFIRE, The New York Times' in-house "conservative" -- who endorsed Bill Clinton in 1992, like so many conservatives -- was sure Mel Gibson's movie "The Passion of the Christ" would incite anti-Semitic violence. Thus far, the pogroms have failed to materialize."  FACT: William Safire a liberal? Obviously, Ann's either suffering a severe case of Blonde-itis, or she's back on the bottle and is simply too sloshed to think straight. Just because Safire's the only conservative who has enough taste to NOT drool all over her bony, q-tip body, it doesn't mean he's a liberal. The size of Ann's ego is matched only by her huge, cottage-cheese thighs.  LIE: "With all the subtlety of a Mack truck, Safire called Gibson's movie a version of 'the medieval  passion play , preserved in pre-Hitler Germany at Oberammergau, a source of the hatred of all Jews as Christ killers.' (Certainly every Aryan Nation skinhead murderer I've ever met was also a devoted theater buff and 'passion play' aficionado.)" FACT: Despite Coulter's glaring admission that she associates with "aryan skinhead murderers", she also has a big nose and a long, giraffe neck. With her ratty blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, she looks like a poster girl for the Master Race. In fact, reading her columns reminds me eerily of  Mein Kampf . I bet she writes her racist rants in a cellar lined with Nazi flags and iron swastikas. LIE: "Referring to the passion play as 'pre-Hitler' is a slightly fancier version of every adolescent's favorite argument:  You're like Hitler! " FACT: Ann's a lying whore skank. Everything she says is a lie, because she's a lying liar who only knows hate and anger. Did I mention she has ratty hair and cottage cheese thighs?  LIE: "Despite repeated suggestions from liberals -- including the in-house 'conservative' and Clinton-supporter at the Times -- Hitler is not what happens when you gin up Christians. Like Timothy McVeigh, the Columbine killers and the editorial board of The New York Times, Hitler detested Christians." FACT: Ann Coulter wouldn't know the truth if it crawl up and bit her on her huge, mugwump feeding tube. She can prance around her upscale Connecticut neighborhood in her nice Gucci shoes and expensive cashmere sweaters all she wants, but that won't change the fact that her father smells of elderberries and her mother associates with known circus clowns. LIE: "Indeed, Hitler denounced Christianity as an 'invention of the Jew' and vowed that the 'organized lie (of Christianity) must be smashed' so that the state would 'remain the absolute master.' Interestingly, this was the approach of all the great mass murderers of the last century -- all of whom were atheists: Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot." FACT: Obviously, Ann hasn't been laid since the Eisenhower adminstration. If she keeps plastering on her makeup with a mason's trowel, she'll never get a man. And what's up with that ratty hair, and those cottage cheese thighs?  LIE: "In the United States, more than 30 million babies have been killed by abortion since Roe v. Wade, vs. seven abortion providers killed. Yeah -- keep your eye on those Christians!" FACT: I bet Ann doesn't douche. That's her problem, right there. Maybe if she'd clean herself up and stop paying street bums for sex, she'd wouldn't be such a mean, vile, hate-spewing bitch. The only reason the Republicans allow her ugly, pimply face into their fascist party is because she puts out. I bet she's been boinked by every Republican in Congress, including Zell Miller. LIE: "But again I ask: Does anyone at the Times have the vaguest notion what Christianity is? (Besides people who go around putting up nativity scenes that have to be taken down by court order?) The religion that toppled the Roman Empire -- anyone?" FACT: It wasn't Christianity that toppled the Roman Empire, Ann. It was your bad breath. Ann's breath smells like Strom Thurman crawled inside her mouth and died. But of course, it's easier to launch hateful, ad hominem attacks against the New York Times than to buy a bottle of Listerine, isn't it? LIE: "Gibson didn't insert Jews into the story for some Machiavellian, racist reason. Christ was a Jew crucified by Romans at the request of other Jews in Jerusalem. I suppose if Gibson had moved the story to suburban Cleveland and portrayed Republican logging executives crucifying Christ, the left would calm down. But it simply didn't happen that way." FACT: Oooh, I HATE HER GUTS! She thinks she's soooooo HOT, flitting around all the morning talk shows like a ratty-haired gadfly, with her snotty little remarks and her cottage-cheese thighs! If I hadn't chewed my fingernails to the bone reading her column, I would just scratch her big, baby-blue eyes out, yes I would!  LIE: "Of course, the original text is no excuse in Hollywood. The villains of Tom Clancy's book 'The Sum of All Fears' were recently transformed from Muslim terrorists to neo-Nazis for the movie version. You wouldn't want to upset the little darlings. They might do something rash like slaughter 3,000 innocent American civilians in a single day. The only religion that can be constantly defamed and insulted is the one liberals pretend to be terrified of." FACT: RIGHT-WING WHORRRRRRRE!!!!!! I HAAAAAAAAATE HER STINKING GUTS!!!! WHORE SKANK SLUT BIMBO HATEMONGERING WHORE!!!!!!!

Ann could never refute your logical arguments, never. All she could ever do would be to launch some more of her Zionist Nazi X'ian  ad hominem attacks. (And yes, I once got a Liberal so worked up during an argument by throwing facts at her that she really did call me a 'Zionist Nazi X'ian' in a frothing rage, despite the impossible triple-twisted logic of the thing.)    Posted by:  CavalierX |  March 12, 2004 at 02:05 AM     You should write a book: Lying Nazi Cottage Cheese Thighs and the Ann Coulters That Have Them.   Posted by:  SpaceMonkey |  March 12, 2004 at 08:37 AM     Um, whether she's got cottage cheese thighs or not, I'd do her.   Posted by: El-ahrairah |  March 12, 2004 at 10:28 AM     Ol' Max would be three limbs to the good if he hadn't picked up that dropped grenade. Only the fact that he survived prevented a Darwin Award. He wasn't a "war hero," he was an idiot.   Posted by:  BarCodeKing |  March 14, 2004 at 01:31 PM     Amazing, isn't it, how she can have "a bony, q-tip body" AND "huge cottage-cheese thighs." This unnatural combination clearly proves she is a Satan-spawned demon with infernal powers of deception. Also, this slut who has boinked every Republican and pays street bums for sex hasn't gotten laid since the Evil Eisenhower administration... only a diabolic, logic-twisting witch could manage that. This shows just how screwed up she is and how we shouldn't listen to anything she says, ever. By the way, have you heard Al Franken wrote a great new book about President Bush? Ha, Ha, Your Dog Died. He's so witty.   Posted by: Amber |  March 15, 2004 at 02:07 PM     I like the FACT that the list of FACTS about Ann Coulter contained no FACTS at all. It proves the FACT that she's beating your stupid asses down so bad, you have to resort to crap like that to try and feel a wittle betta. WAAAWAAA ANNS A MEAN BITCH AND SHE SUCKS....your going to have to do better than that. YEEeeAARRGGGGGGG   Posted by:  Mongrul |  March 19, 2004 at 04:37 PM     Oh, Ok, I get it....good one....you got me.   Posted by:  Mongrul |  March 19, 2004 at 05:41 PM     Bravo! I couldn't have snarked it better myself.   Posted by:  Drumwaster |  April 09, 2004 at 12:04 PM     You stupid Repubelikkkans can;t even figure out that she, Dickie, Chimp and Knumbskull et al all are numbing you dumbshits out of the little feelings you ever did have, and into the Fascist Fucking morons that the original poster was trying to convey about Ann Skankulter. She will get hung along with the rest of you fucking morons after we bury your ass in the landslide that is coming. You better go sharpen your little pen knives to take with you down into yoru fucking bunkers buckeroos, because after JFK gets the node, you ficks are DEAD!!!!  I can't wait you pussies. You wouldn'y ahve a clue to save your sorry asses.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1   Posted by: EatshitanddieReupugfucks |  September 30, 2004 at 12:04 PM     Yea, you buncha Nazi fascists! I can't wait until we have an honest, good, moral, leader like John Kerry-Heinz so we can make lampshades and soap out of you all and throw what is left in the ovens!!!   Posted by:  Dougster |  October 10, 2004 at 05:39 AM     Ann Coulter is a lier...has always been a lier and forever will be a lier...She lied about her age...is she 41 or 43, who the hell really care's, except for Bill O' Reilly! Shes a slut and tries to make herself up to look like a teenager when in fact shes a old whore. I bet old ass "zell miller" pokes that slut up her ass...By the way I'd like to kick zell millers ass..I'm a libertarian on top of it all, and I still can't stand those republican whores    Posted by: Mick |  October 29, 2004 at 08:16 PM     Bush told me she can sure suck dick.lol   Posted by: johnathan |  November 04, 2004 at 11:25 PM     Hitler was right about Christianity: it's a Jewish religion. And regardless of whether or not that is important, it's also insane.   Posted by:  S.R. Prozak |  November 28, 2004 at 08:20 AM     If Ann Coulter ever says something nice and thoughtful, I'll know it's the end of the world!LOL   Posted by: Mike |  November 28, 2004 at 05:31 PM     Left nuts are conflicted because they are atracted to Ann Coulter. They are angry at themselves but they take it out on the object of their desire. They don't hate Ann Coulter, they hate the hard on they have for a non-democrat. Ann Coulter is beautifull and brilliant , the best combination.   Posted by: Friend of USA |  December 05, 2004 at 08:32 AM     she is a lying whore with cottage cheese thighs who is going to retroactively blow the election for bush.   Posted by: Stalin Lives In Boston |  December 14, 2004 at 09:58 PM     Well, as a female, I consider Ann a great role model. Not to mention, that I'd love to have a set of, "cottage cheese thighs," just like hers!   Posted by: JannyMae |  December 15, 2004 at 11:21 AM     Dude, ann is one boney lil facist bitch. Of course some folks would like to flesh her pelt, because hate sex is soo much better than makin love. But boning a skeleton would be more satisfying than ann's anorexic nazi ass. Sheesh, if she's the Republican image of sexiness then no wonder we're in a world of shit. Dude, ann is not attractive, and I consider my self fairly conservative. Gimmer some of dat sweet cinnamon or mochachino with big ol creamcheese thighs, now that's i'm talkin about. White republican shicks are good for an assfuck, but make sure you bring lot's o lube.. dey gots pussies like 35 girt sandpaper, and an attitude to match...   Posted by: Camper Van |  December 25, 2004 at 05:16 PM     Here's a fun 60 second rant about the amorous shenanigans of Bill O'Reilly and his right wing pals. http://www.averyant.com/video_rightwingsex.html And here's 60 seconds of Fox Bashing http://www.averyant.com/video_fox.html www.averyant.com   Posted by:  mike |  December 28, 2004 at 10:05 PM     The truth of the matter is that people hate her because she is right. Calling her names only shows your ignorance on the issues Americans face today. If you want to be anti-American - fine. Then get the Hell out of the country. America would be a better place without people who can't get their head out of their ass to see the other side off issues. I've read all of Ann's books but I've read a Al Franken's book too. I don't agree with Al - but I don't blast him. He has a right to his own opinion. Remember "Those who do not know their opponent's arguements do not fully understand their own". Read her book and digest it. Form you own opinions - don't hate her because others hate her and because she's conservative. *steps off soap box*   Posted by: Chelle |  January 05, 2005 at 07:15 PM     I browse sites like these in search of something. . . and articles and posts like this one here are proof enough that I'll never find what I'm looking for - and Ann is right - there is no such thing as a liberal with a "valid point". I just fail to understand someone can spew such ignorant childish attacks on someone and in the same breadth be so incredibly, incredibly stupid as to call HER the hate monger. People like this not only have no respect for anything (including themselves), they lack the intelligence it takes to actually recognize a valid point when it tops the best seller list, tops the cable news ratings, and wins an election.   Posted by: snoogins |  January 07, 2005 at 03:35 PM     It saddens me to see so many people I agree with too ignorant to recognize a spot of brilliant sarcasm when they see it.   Posted by: Travis |  January 09, 2005 at 12:36 AM     I'm not sure what's better the satire or the knee-jerk criticism of the people that don't get it.   Posted by: RMH |  January 10, 2005 at 11:33 AM     One day I hope to see the headline: "Anne Coulter Murdered by Liberal Arab Lesbian"   Posted by: gay boy |  January 10, 2005 at 09:22 PM     ...during torid lesbian jello sex. Just because.   Posted by: Indy |  January 12, 2005 at 11:30 AM       Next  »      Verify your Comment Previewing your Comment  Posted by:    |       This is only a preview.
