                    September 3, 2002 <br>
                    By&nbsp;Pamela Troy</font></p>
                  <p>And so the steady devolution of American political discourse 
                    continues. The two latest contributions are the recent attempts 
                    by George Gurley in the New York Observer and Melik Kaylan 
                    in the Wall Street Journal to examine the appeal of slime-babe 
                    Ann Coulter. Apparently Coulter's output of offensive, borderline-violent 
                    pronouncements on liberals has become so prolific that her 
                    fans now feel they need to explain themselves. The result 
                    was first the gushing Gurley piece, which reads like a TIGER 
                    BEAT interview with Julius Streicher. This was followed a 
                    few days later by a marginally more dignified effort by Kaylan, 
                    in which she asks what's the big deal about Coulter making 
                    statements that advocate violence against liberals. Both pieces 
                    are interesting in what they reveal about Coulter and her 
                    appeal. 
                  <p>I had to read the Gurley piece several times to convince 
                    myself it wasn't a parody, and I'm still somewhat at a loss 
                    every time I see it. Is Gurley serious? Is he sober? Is he 
                    out of high-school yet? Did his editor read this before it 
                    ran, and if so, does his editor have something against Gurley? 
                  <p>Or are we all missing something? Is the Gurley interview 
                    in fact a disguised attack on Coulter? The most quoted section 
                    is Ann Coulter's comment, near the end of the interview, "My 
                    only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New 
                    York Times Building," but for my money, a more interesting 
                    passage comes early in the piece. Gurley is waiting to meet 
                    Coulter at Michaels, "the sunlit media-centric restaurant 
                    on West 55th Street." He describes his reaction to Coulter's 
                    description of New York Times letter writers as "pathetic 
                    little parakeet males and grim, quivering, angry women on 
                    the Upper West Side of Manhattan hoping to be chosen as that 
                    day s purveyor of hate." "At that point," Gurley swoons, "I 
                    thought I was already falling in love." 
                  <p>But then he says, in the second chapter, "I experienced an 
                    emotion I was less sure about." 
                  <p>'Every pernicious idea to come down the pike is instantly 
                    embraced by liberals to prove how powerful they are,' Ms. 
                    Coulter writes. 'Liberals hate society and want to bring it 
                    down to reinforce their sense of invincibility.' 
                  <p>"Now Ms. Coulter had triggered something else in me: I was 
                    getting really pissed off. I felt infuriated stirred up. 
                  <p>I looked around Michael's restaurant. They were everywhere." 
                  <p>This emotion Gurley "was less sure about" is hatred. The 
                    "they" Gurley refers to are liberals. While this doesn't actually 
                    put Gurley in a brown shirt, the image of a young man reading 
                    a right-wing polemic that accuses a given group of wanting 
                    to destroy society, and then gazing angrily about a café and 
                    reflecting "they are everywhere," does conjure up a moment 
                    in another country in another time. Other writers have remarked 
                    on the similarity of Coulter's hyperbolic vitriol against 
                    liberals to Nazi propaganda in 1930s Germany about Jews, but 
                    rarely has the parallel been more clearly illustrated. "To 
                    strip the world of its soul, that and nothing else, is what 
                    Judaism wants," wrote Hitler associate Alfred Rosenberg in 
                    1928. "Even now, while the Jews still live among us, all their 
                    undertakings reveal this aim " 
                  <p>The rest of the interview does little to dispel this sense 
                    of deja vu, as Gurley and Coulter proceed to "whoop it up" 
                    at their table by badmouthing "Manhattan liberals", the media, 
                    and New York. In fact, invective against the Big Apple and 
                    its residents crops up so much in the interview that the words 
                    "New York" start to leap out at the reader. "They're such 
                    parochial idiots here in New York," Coulter says. "Oh God, 
                    they're so stupid in New York! But it's fun living in the 
                    belly of the beast, don't you think?" "The rest of America 
                    hates New York." After a while one starts to suspect that, 
                    for Coulter, the term "New Yorker" is code for something else. 
                  <p>One often-asked question about Coulter is the extent to which 
                    she actually believes what she writes. A passage in the New 
                    York Observer piece does try to address this. "I mean, usually 
                    when I write up a column, I know what's going to drive them 
                    crazy," Coulter says. "That is my signature style, to start 
                    with the wild, bald, McCarthyite overstatements seemingly 
                    and then back it up with methodical and laborious research. 
                    Taunting liberals is like having a pet that does tricks. Sit! 
                    Beg! Shake! Then they do it." 
                  <p>So here we have the essence of what passes for Coulter's 
                    wit. You see, if you grossly insult people, impugn their loyalty 
                    and threaten them with violence, they get all offended and 
                    upset! Isn't that just priceless? 
                  <p>Melik Kaylan's Wall Street Journal piece is a sedate attempt 
                    to sell this kind of irresponsible approach to political discussion, 
                    and the euphemisms for Coulter's hate-filled invective are 
                    piled thickly. "Effortlessly guilt-free flights of extroversion," 
                    "fierce ­ but never humorless ­ conservatism," "Impassioned 
                    outrage and outrageousness." The problem, as Melik Kaylan 
                    sees it, is that "such effrontery" (like calling for the "physical 
                    intimidation of liberals") "sounds more palatable in the mouths 
                    of Black Panthers." And even Coulter's invective is different 
                    from theirs, you see, because "They meant it literally, bombs 
                    and all. Miss Coulter, on the other hand, acts out her thoughts 
                    in a kind of 'what if' political theater, a tongue-in-cheek 
                    agitprop, and believes that most Americans understand the 
                    difference Why would anybody even pretend to believe that 
                    Ms. Coulter wishes any real harm to the New York Times or 
                    wishes to convert all Muslims forcibly to Christianity?" 
                  <p>The question is, why should we not believe that Ms. Coulter 
                    wishes any real harm to the New York Times or wishes to convert 
                    all Muslims forcibly to Christianity? Because she's tall blonde 
                    and pretty and shaves her legs? Because she wears skirts and 
                    nylons and appears on CNN? Kaylan reminds me here of the college 
                    boys I knew back in North Carolina in the '80s who behaved 
                    as though they thought racists were fabulous monsters akin 
                    to little green men from Mars, and that there was nothing 
                    funnier than scaring the yokels by pretending to be one. 
                  <p>Since Kaylan has to reach back a couple of decades to the 
                    Black Panthers to find a parallel to Coulter's bloodthirsty 
                    rhetoric on the left, it might pay her to consider at length 
                    the history of political violence in this country. There was 
                    a lot of rhetoric like Coulter's in the south in the 60s and 
                    early 70s, and not from the liberals and leftists who put 
                    their lives on the line marching for Black Civil Rights. Liberals 
                    were accused of being Communists, of hating America, of wanting 
                    to destroy it. Some liberals were beaten, their homes firebombed. 
                    Some of them were murdered. There was rhetoric like Coulter's 
                    about anti-war demonstrators. Some anti-war demonstrators 
                    were beaten and harassed. Some of them were killed. In fact, 
                    for the past hundred years, from the rash of Klan lynchings 
                    in the early 1900s, to the institutionalized brutality of 
                    the McCarthy period, to the truck bomb in Oklahoma City, to 
                    the fire-bombings of abortion clinics in the present, political 
                    violence in this country has tended to come from the right 
                    ­ not the left. Liberals would be idiots not to take Coulter's 
                    rhetoric seriously, even if Coulter does not. The chances 
                    are, there are people in this country who read Coulter and 
                    take what she says very seriously indeed -- and not because 
                    they disagree with it. 
                  <p>Perhaps the best example of what is wrong with Coulter's 
                    rhetoric comes at the end of the Gurley piece. After describing 
                    the horrific psychic trauma of hearing Angela Davis speak 
                    in college and having a "hippie girl" yell at him for liking 
                    Margaret Thatcher in the early 90s, Gurley asks Coulter plaintively, 
                    "There was nothing wrong with me?" She tells him there was 
                    not, assures him that liberals are just plain stupid and hateful, 
                    and the piece closes with him gazing gratefully upwards at 
                    her. "I looked up at her from in the taxi. She seemed very 
                    tall against the sky." 
                  <p>Yes, there is something wrong if you have reached your thirties 
                    and the only political argument you can muster is insults, 
                    threats, and misrepresentation. Yes, there is something wrong 
                    when this approach to political "argument" is countenanced 
                    by the mainstream press and offered a national venue. Yes, 
                    there is something wrong with mainstream political rhetoric 
                    that can only be defended with assurances that the speaker 
                    "doesn't really mean it."

                    beliefs. No Ms. Kaylan. It's not OK to pretend to hate people 
                    for their political beliefs.</p>
