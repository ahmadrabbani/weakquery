<h3><font color="#cc9900">Whole Foods Boycott?</font></h3>
<p><font color="#999999">After WF CEO John Mackey wrote an </font><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052970204251404574342170072865070.html" target=_blank><font color="#999999">op-ed </font><font color="#9999ff">piece for the Wall Street Journal</font></a><font color="#999999"> decrying the administration's proposed healthcare
reform, progressives called for a boycott, and Boycott Whole Foods </font><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=119099537379" target=_blank><font color="#999999">Facebook group</font></a><font color="#999999"> got nearly 13,000 members in just a few days.</font></p>
<p><font color="#999999"><b>But I'm not so keen on a boycott.</b>
For starters, where would boycotters shop instead? I doubt there is
some other grocery near most people which is the very embodiment of
progressive utopia in a way that Whole Foods isn't. And even with all
of WF's questionable practices, and their CEO's extreme Libertarian
views, WF is still likely the most progressive grocery chain around.</font></p>
<p><font color="#999999"><b>Another reason to question a boycott
was provided by </b></font><a href="http://weeklysift.blogspot.com/2009/08/exact-measures.html#wholefoods08172009" target=_blank><font color="#9999ff"><b>The Daily Sift</b></font></a><font color="#999999"><b>:</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#cccc99">"In the ideal boycott, you temporarily
stop doing business with an organization until they change some
particular practice. The classic example is the Montgomery Bus Boycott
that ended the segregation of city buses. But a boycott is on shakier
ground when you're trying to punish somebody for their personal
political beliefs rather than what their organization does. The worst
example in recent years was the campaign to get radio stations not to
play songs by the Dixie Chicks after one of them told an English
audience that she was ashamed of President Bush."</font></p>
<p><font color="#999999"><b>On a related note, many of the
boycotters have pledged that they will "never shop at Whole Foods
again".</b> But that's not a boycott. A boycott is a <i>temporary</i>
cessation of business in order to get a company to change something. If
someone pledges <i>never</i> to shop at WF again, what exactly is
their goal? What do they hope to change, and how do they think their
actions will support that change?</font></p>
<p><font color="#999999"><b>And while we likely won't change the
CEO's political views no matter how many of us boycott, </b>there's a
lot we can do to keep Whole Foods honest, whether we shop there or not.
Indeed, Mackey has a long history of taking Whole Foods in a better
direction after (polite but firm) lobbying for such. Let's focus on
that.</font></p>

</div><b>Whole
Foods Market does some good things.</b>&nbsp; For starters, they
practically
created the modern market for organic foods single-handedly.&nbsp;
Organics
would likely still be hard to find and a lot more expensive (rather
than a little more expensive) were it not for their efforts.&nbsp;
Whole
Foods also requires its suppliers to meet standards for humane
treatment of farm animals, which has greatly improved their
existence.&nbsp; And WF supports the Fair Trade movement and has a
more democratic workplace than just about any
other organization of its size.&nbsp; So to give credit where it's due,
Whole
Foods has done a lot of good.</p>
<p><b>But just because a company sells natural foods doesn't mean
it can do no wrong.</b>&nbsp; Many of Whole Foods' actions have been
controversial and sometimes even illegal, especially where its labor
practices are concerned.&nbsp; As
the Texas Observer put it, <font color="#660000">"People shop at Whole
Foods not just because it offers organic produce and natural foods, but
because it claims to run its business in a way that demonstrates a
genuine concern for the community, the environment, and the 'whole
planet,' in the words of its motto.&nbsp; In reality, Whole Foods has
gone on
a corporate feeding frenzy in recent years, swallowing rival retailers
across the country.... The expansion is driven by a simple and
lucrative business strategy: high prices and low wages." </font><font size=-2>(1)</font></p>
<p><b>I'm not suggesting that anyone stop shopping at Whole Foods
or boycott it </b>(see sidebar at left) -- I just want consumers to
realize that even a company that puts on a socially-responsible face
doesn't always live up to its own hype.</p>
<p><b>Below are sixteen questionable aspects of Whole Foods
Market.</b>&nbsp;
(I'm not including that CEO John Mackey is a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/01/04/100104fa_fact_paumgarten?currentPage=all#ixzz0baVWuHq0" target=_blank>climate change denier</a> and that he opposes Obama's healthcare reform, because those are his personal
opinions and unrelated to Whole Foods itself.)&nbsp; And when you get
done with these, be sure to check out my <a href=wholefoods-articles.html>summaries of dozens of media articles</a>
critical of Whole Foods.<br>

<p class=category>Business practices</p>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(1)</b></font><b>
Aggressive monopolization.</b></span>&nbsp; Tons of independent co-ops
throughout the country don't exist any more because Whole Foods bought
them out. Whole Foods also absorbed all its significant competitors
(Wild Oats, Bread &amp; Circus, Fresh Fields, Bread of Life, Merchant
of Vino, Nature's Heartland, Food for Thought, Harry's Farmers Market,
Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods Markets, and U.K.-based Fresh &amp; Wild). <font size=-2>(2)</font> &nbsp;They've thus created a near-monopoly in the
natural foods grocery business. Consumers are better served by a
diversity of stores, but Whole Foods has been trying to wipe out the
competition -- and has been quite successful at doing so.</p>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(2)</b></font><b>
Fierceless devotion to profit.</b></span>&nbsp; It's not unusual for a
business to try to maximize profit. But when the business puts on a
socially-responsible face, consumers have the hope that the business
will put "Doing the Right Thing" above "Making More Money". That's not
always the case at Whole Foods. It's precisely why Whole Foods swallows
its competitors, sells certain questionable products, and keeps wages
as low as possible. Common Dreams says, "A closer look at the company's
business practices and Mackey's ideas about business and society
reveals a vision not that different from a McDonald's or a Wal-Mart. In
fact, the Whole Foods business model is more or less the standard stuff
of Fortune 500 ambition. This is a vision of mega-chain retailing that
involves strategic swallowing up (or driving out of business) of
smaller retail competitors. It is a business model that objectively
complements the long-term industrialization of organics (that is,
large-scale corporate farms) over small family farms. It is also a
vision in which concerns about social responsibility do not necessarily
apply where less publicly visible company suppliers are concerned.
Subsidiaries of cigarette manufacturers (for example, Altria, owner of
Kraft's organic products) or low-wage exploiters of minority workers
(such as California Bottling Co., Inc., makers of Whole Foods's
private-label water) are apparently welcome partners in this particular
eco-corporate version of 'the sustainable future.'"<font size=-2>
(2,5)</font></p>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(3)</b></font><b>
Forcing smaller competitors to hand over private financial data.</b></span>
Whole Foods has been trying to force many of its smaller competitors to
hand over private sales and financial data about those smaller stores.
Whole Foods already holds a massive advantage due to its size, but
that's apparently not enough for them. As one of the harassed smaller
groceries put it, "Allowing Whole Foods to look through all of our
private information about how we operate and what our plans are for the
future unfairly adds to their already large size and financial
advantage. We've been able to build a successful local business being
David against their Goliath, and we're happy to keep doing that, but we
do object to having one hand tied behind our back." <font size=-2>(19)</font></p>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(4)</b></font><b> Lying.</b></span>&nbsp;
According to one farmer, a WF-approved slaughterhouse failed WF's
inspection for cattle since its stun gun wasn't working properly, but
WF continued to use that slaughterhouse for sheep.&nbsp; (So much for
the supposed humane standards.)&nbsp; The farmer also said that WF
wanted them to ship their cattle to a slaughterhouse 1400 miles away,
and would still label the beef "Local" despite this. <font size=-2>(<a href="http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=119099537379&amp;topic=11627" target=_blank>26</a>)</font>&nbsp; <i>See "Misleading shoppers about its support of small farmers" at right for another case of lying.</i><font size=-2></font></p>
<p class=category>Questionable products<br>
</p>
<span class=reason></span>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(5)</b></font><b>
Refusal to carry only turtle-safe shrimp.</b></span> When Earth Island
Institute asked Whole Foods to carry only shrimp caught in nets
certified to protect endangered sea turtles, Whole Foods flatly
refused. <font size=-2>(1)</font></p>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(6)</b></font><b>
Refusal to come clean on the use of GMO's and toxic chemicals in its
products.</b></span> "Whole Foods is still not fully transparent about
the use of GMOs in store-brand products, and has ignored shareholder
requests for information on the use of toxic chemicals in products like
baby bottles that are sold in stores." <font size=-2>(12)</font>&nbsp; Activists protesting WFM's sale of GM foods outside a store were <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_23237.cfm" target=_blank>arrested</a>,
likely at WFM's behest. (Why else would the police be there?)&nbsp;
Whole Foods also asked shareholders to vote against an activist
resolution
asking WFM to report about endocrine disruptors and other toxic
chemicals in its products.<font size=-2> (13)</font></p>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(7)</b></font><b>
Selling "organic" food that possibly isn't.</b></span>&nbsp;
Much of WF's
private-label frozen fruits and vegetables come from China, where
organics are completely unregulated.&nbsp; This means no government
(theirs or ours) checks to make sure that the farms are actually using
organic
methods.&nbsp; It's a huge leap of faith to think that suppliers on the
other
side of the world are truly supplying organics when they know that know
one is checking up on them, especially when China has had such a long
list of manufacturing controversies about contaminated products.&nbsp;
To top it off, Whole Foods uses the "USDA Organic" seal even though the
USDA isn't
actually verifying that the food is really organic, and they use
product names like "California Blend", when the California Blend was
really made in China. <font size=-2> (21)</font>&nbsp; And even for domestic food, Whole Foods has been caught selling produce as organic that is anything but.<font size=-2> (25)</font><br>
</p>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(8)</b></font><b>
Selling dangerous food.</b></span> You might think that with a company
that champions healthy eating, anything in their store would be safe to
eat.&nbsp; You'd be wrong.&nbsp; Whole Foods sold fish so toxic in mercury that one
customer's blood levels had to be reported to the Center for Disease
Control. <font size=-2>(17)</font>&nbsp; Whole Foods didn't start
identifying potentially mercury-laden fish in its California stores
until the government forced them to do so.&nbsp; Even then, a quarter of
Whole Foods stores failed to display proper signage as required by law.
<font size=-2>(18)</font> <br>
<br>
In 2008, five people had to be hospitalized after eating
E.coli-contaminated beef from Whole Foods.&nbsp; The beef was sold even after
it was supposed to have been recalled. <small>(22)&nbsp; </small>Others
were
sickened by bad milk from Whole Foods, resulting in "hundreds of
thousands of dollars in medical expenses.... One victim, a twenty-eight
year old mother, will likely require a kidney transplant." <font size=-2>(23)</font><br>
<br>
And when Whole Foods opened its store in Napa, it got an "F" on the
county's health inspection. <font size=-2>(24)</font><br>

<span class=reason></span>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(9)</b></font><b>
Anti-Union.</b></span> Whole Foods is so fiercely anti-union it has
actually fired employees who were trying to organize one.&nbsp; As Common
Dreams says, "Whole Foods matches Wal-Mart in its reputation for
corporate anti-unionism.&nbsp; It's a hostility rooted in a management whose
'core values' are intrinsically patrician and antidemocratic.&nbsp; The
latter qualities were revealed in all their dismal hypocrisy most
forcefully in 2002 when employees of the chain's Madison, Wisconsin,
store voted to unionize and join the United Food and Commercial Workers
(UFCW).&nbsp; In a story that caught the attention of the New York Times and
other media, Mackey had what might be described as a New Age temper
tantrum, treating the specter of collective bargaining at one of his
stores as a disaster of almost unspeakable proportions....The yearlong
effort to defeat Madison's first organizing drive revealed Mackey as a
"socially enlightened" poseur, a New Age business type who talks about
love and ecological footprints and other enlightened things, but who
turns to the hard boot of corporate scare tactics and disinformation
when confronted with a group of employees who dare to assert their
democratic right to self-representation." <font size=-2>(1,10)<br>
<br>
</font>And "In 2006, after truck drivers working at its San
Francisco-based distribution center voted to unionize with the
Teamsters.&nbsp; The company fired two of the drivers, altered its sick-leave
policy, froze wage increases, refused to provide information to the
union that was necessary to negotiate a contract, and 'harassed and
disciplined employees,' found NLRB investigators, who concluded that
'Whole Foods engaged in a variety of [illegal] retaliatory measures to
discourage union activity.'&nbsp; An out-of-court settlement required Whole
Foods to reinstate the employees and reverse some of its policies." <font size=-2>(20)</font></p>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(10)</b></font><b>
Poor working conditions.</b></span> Workers organizing for a union in
Madison said, "The ridiculously high turnover rate, wages that are
lower than the industry standard, pervasive lack of respect, constant
understaffing, absence of a legally-binding grievance procedure, and
other poor and unfair labor practices--all of which have led to
widespread low morale--highlight the simple fact that workers ultimately
have no say in the terms and conditions of their employment at any
Whole Foods Market--not just Madison. Workers are not recognized or
appreciated for their contributions. Instead, Whole Foods relies on
worker apathy and lack of investment in their jobs to keep turnover
high, and for the most part, wages, benefits, and other working
conditions poor.&nbsp; This environment should be unacceptable for any
workplace." <font size=-2>(1)</font></p>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(11)</b></font><b>
Low Wages.</b></span><b>&nbsp; </b>Whole Foods has been widely criticized
for keeping wages low.&nbsp; "Companies such as Whole Foods or other
non-union chain competitors are paying many of their hourly employees
what in late 1960s dollars would be equivalent to the minimum wage or
below." <font size=-2>(1)</font><font color="#cc0000"><b>&nbsp;</b></font>
And they can certainly afford to pay more.&nbsp; Whole Foods stores bring in
$800 per square foot in a year, double the industry average. <font size=-2>(11)</font></p>
<p class=category>Controversy about suppliers<br>
</p>
<span class=reason></span>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(12)</b></font><b>
Failure to support farmworkers.</b></span> When United Farm Worker
activists passed out literature at an Austin Whole Foods Market, Whole
Foods called the cops and had them arrested. Embarrassed by the public
outcry, Whole Foods then promised to support the UFW's grape boycott,
but then broke that promise when it moved the store a couple of blocks
away, saying the agreement applied only to the old location. They also
produced deceptive literature for their customers blasting the
farmworkers group and describing farmworker conditions as being no
problem at all. About this, the UFW says, "Several major cases have
been tried in states such as North Carolina and Florida during recent
years where it was found that workers were being kept by their
employers in a state of virtual slavery. This is worlds away from the
ideal and naïve (and disingenuous) information put out by Whole Foods."

<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(13)</b></font><b>
Misleading shoppers about its support of small farmers.</b></span>
Signs at Whole Foods Market say, "Help the Small Farmer -- Buying
organic supports the small, family farmers that make up a large
percentage of organic food producers."&nbsp; What they're not telling you is
that while the <i>number</i> of family farmers is a large percentage
of the total, overwhelming majority of organic <i>output</i> comes
from corporate farms.&nbsp; As Slate put it: "There are a lot of small,
family-run organic farmers, but their share of the organic crop in this
country, and of the produce sold at Whole Foods, is minuscule."&nbsp; Slate
also pointed out that Whole Foods has pictures and profiles of small
organic farmers in their stores, but doesn't actually carry products
from those farmers.<font size=-2> (14)&nbsp; </font>One farmer complained that Whole Foods claimed to sell its products, when in fact it never has.&nbsp;<font size=-2> (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=119099537379&amp;topic=11627" target=_blank>26</a>)<br>
</font></p>
<p class=category>Corporate controversies<br>
</p>
<span class=reason></span>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(14)</b></font><b>
CEO posing as someone else on the Internet.</b></span> For seven years,
Whole Foods CEO John Mackey posted on the Yahoo Finance board about his
company and its competitors while pretending to be someone else.&nbsp; By
trashing rival Wild Oats, Wild Oats' stock price could drop and he could buy
them out for less money.&nbsp; Mackey also had the gall to anonymously praise
himself.&nbsp; ("I like Mackey's haircut. I think he looks cute!") <font size=-2>(6)</font> &nbsp;He didn't stop there: He also criticized
specific employees, under the cover of anonymity.&nbsp; Daily Kos said of
this, "The very idea of the founder and CEO of a major national
corporation hiding behind a pseudonym to lambaste one of his own hourly
wage earners on an online message board says something about the
personal moral integrity of union-busting executives." <font size=-2>(7)</font>
&nbsp;After being discovered, he was unrepentant, trying to justify his
behavior in a long blog post, and making a point to say specifically
that his actions weren't unethical.<font size=-2> (8, 9)</font></p>
<span class=reason></span>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(15)</b></font><b>
Gagging shareholders.</b></span><b> </b>Whole Foods refused to let
shareholders speak about shareholder resolutions at its annual meeting.&nbsp;
"'Given that the annual shareholder meeting is the one time each year
that top executives and directors have to show up and be accountable to
shareholders, it is unconscionable for companies not to allow
proponents to make a short statement in support of their proposals,'
said Beth Young, senior research associate for The Corporate Library
(TCL), which assesses corporate governance....'It also seems to flatly
contradict the company's pledge to 'recognize everyone's right to be
listened to and heard regardless of their point of view,'' Mr. Herbert
told SocialFunds.com.&nbsp; 'Whole Foods should recognize that any company
that presents itself as socially responsible, as it does, is an easy
target for a cynical press and public when it fails to uphold
reasonable standards of corporate practice.'"<font size=-2> (15)</font></p>
<p><span class=reason><font color="#990000"><b>(16)</b></font><b>
Obfuscating executive compensation.</b></span>&nbsp; Forbes magazine says,
"Media reports frequently tout Whole Foods' pay policy, which caps the
chief executive's salary and bonus at 14 times the average worker's
pay.&nbsp; The Wall Street Journal, Slate.com, Harvard Business Review and
BusinessWeek have all mentioned the pay cap, generally in favorable
terms.&nbsp; But they all omitted one thing: stock options."&nbsp; When you count
stock options, Mackey really made close to $3 million, or <i>eighty-two</i>
times the average workers' salary.&nbsp; Forbes continues, "Whole Foods
manages to obscure Mackey's total pay package by ballyhooing the salary
cap."&nbsp; A company is certainly entitled to pay its execs whatever it
wants, but the issue here is that WF is deceptive about how much its
execs actually receive, relative to the lower-paid workers. <font size=-2>(16)</font></p>

<center> Positive press for Whole Foods</center>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Here's some credit where it's due. </b>This July 2004
article from Fast Company is one of the best I've read about Whole
Foods Market.&nbsp; While it shies away from the more controversial aspects
of the company, it does give a really good insight into the unique
company culture, John Mackey's progressive management style, and the
fact that Whole Foods is responsible for the fact that organic foods
are now available from coast to coast in even mainstream grocery
stores.&nbsp; Of special interest is how animal rights activist Lauren
Ornelas, formerly of Austin herself, recently convinced Mackey of the
cruelty of factory farming, causing him to go mostly vegan and to
direct WFM's suppliers to start treating their livestock more humanely.
While I remain critical of some of WFM's more questionable practices,
this article amply demonstrates how a company can be a powerful force
for making things better. <b>(</b><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/84/wholefoods.html"><b>Read
