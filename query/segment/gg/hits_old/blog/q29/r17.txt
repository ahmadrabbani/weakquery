Control of the flow of goods, information, and  people shifts toward the global level." - Ervin Laszlo,  Quantum Shift in the Global Brain: How the New Scientific Reality Can Change Us and Our World  ( Get the book.  )     "Codex is already doing this in parts of Europe, and the  world trade organization is trying to make sure it happens soon in the USA. They also plan to have all fresh  food irradiated by December 31, 2009. Any food considered to have therapeutic  effects would be considered a  drug and be available by prescription only. For more information, go to www.healthfreedomusa.org. That site also has petitions you can sign to help fight Codex. Yet another pressure group is Operation Cure All, which has a plan to restrict  health information, supplements and  natural therapies." - Susan E. Schenck,  The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit & Planet  ( Get the book.  )     "Since the EU couldn't muster enough scientific proof for the ban, the  world trade organization was bound to find the EU in violation of  world trade organization (WTO) rules, he argues in his book, In Defense of Globalization. Dr. Bhagwati objects to the EU's moratorium on the sale of genetically modified seeds and  foods for the same reason. There simply isn't enough scientific evidence to warrant it, he claims. The antiglob-alization crew, however, thinks that scientific proof is not essential. They think the principle of precaution should be enough, whereas Dr." - William Bonner, Lila Rajiva,  Mobs, Messiahs, and Markets: Surviving the Public Spectacle in Finance and Politics (Agora Series)  ( Get the book.  )     "International Monetary Fund and the  world trade organization . As regional economic agreements become more attractive than multilateral trade arrangements and bilateral trade with the U.S., trade wars become frequent and destabilizing. � North-South trade agreements are cancelled and trade flows disrupted; the international economic/financial system is in shambles. � People pressed into poverty join rebellions against local landowners and government officials." - Ervin Laszlo,  Quantum Shift in the Global Brain: How the New Scientific Reality Can Change Us and Our World  ( Get the book.  )     "The Millennium Development Goals of the  world trade organization are intended to allow an easier flow of goods into developed nations. The WTO is finally catching on to the false sanitary exemptions, and has started enforcing a more scientific approach to nontariff barriers. Their overall objective is "to permit countries to take 'legitimate' measures to protect the  life and health of their consumers (in relation to food safety matters), while prohibiting them from using those measures in a way that unjustifiably restricts trade." - Adam Leith Gollne,  The Fruit Hunters: A Story of Nature, Adventure, Commerce and Obsession  ( Get the book.  )     "The United States signed up for CODEX in the 1990s, when we became members of the  world trade organization (WTO). According to the Congressional  Research Service: "As a member of the  world trade organization , the United States does commit to act in accordance with the rules of the multilateral body. The United States is legally obligated to ensure national laws do not conflict with  world trade organization rules" including laws such as these  new ones being adopted in the EU regulating our freedom to nutritional supplements. Therefore, as a member of the WTO, the U.S." - Leslie Taylor, ND,  The Healing Power of Rainforest Herbs: A Guide to Understanding and Using Herbal Medicinals  ( Get the book.  )     "European moratorium before the  world trade organization later this year. As importantly, the ruling represents the first large scale defeat of genetically modified foods on unarguable scientific grounds, apart from ethical and ideological concerns. Since the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of unlabeled rBGH milk in March 1994, the U.S. has exerted considerable pressure on Mexico and other trading partners to approve rBGH in efforts to  increase pressure on Europe through the  world trade organization ." - Samuel S. Epstein, M.D.,  What's In Your Milk?: An Expos� of Industry and Government Cover-Up on the Dangers of the Genetically Engineered (rBGH) Milk You're Drinking  ( Get the book.  )     "He exposes the fact that the  world trade organization is getting involved with regulating natural dietary supplements in America and around the world. When our government signed on to the  world trade organization it agreed to commit to act in accordance with the rules of this multilateral body. The United States is legally obliged to ensure national laws in America do not conflict with  world trade organization rules. The European Union set up a directive on dietary supplements." - Kevin Trudeau,  Natural Cures They Don't Want You to Know About  ( Get the book.  )     "Since the EU couldn't muster enough scientific proof for the ban, the  world trade organization was bound to find the EU in violation of  world trade organization (WTO) rules, he argues in his book, In Defense of Globalization.

JECFA produces reports on a wide range of issues relating to food safety, including pesticides, sex hormones injected in cattle in feedlots to promote growth, and rBGH, besides other animal drugs. JECFA reports play a major role in international governmental decision making and regulation. However, JECFA committees are unaccountably constituted, meet in secrecy without prior public notice, and rely on unpublished industry data and reports." - Samuel S. Epstein, M.D.,  What's In Your Milk?: An Expos� of Industry and Government Cover-Up on the Dangers of the Genetically Engineered (rBGH) Milk You're Drinking  ( Get the book.  )     "Global Trade Destroys Culture and Food Security Based on Self- sufficiency In 1994, the United States passed legislation to participate in the  world trade organization , and by 1995 markets in Mexico were opened to U.S. farming  products through NAFTA (North  American Free Trade Alliance - U.S., Canada, and Mexico). This legislation was promoted by Republicans and Bill Clinton. It allows Cargill to dump crops into a country and undermine their farming economy, all in the name of free trade. In effect, this creates a "peaceful" tool that threatens the self-sustaining population in any country." - Byron J. Richards,  Fight for Your Health: Exposing the FDA's Betrayal of America  ( Get the book.  )     "Some of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), which comes under the  world trade organization (WTO), may be restricting or even banning dietary supplements in the United States very soon as they already have in Australia and some European countries. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, a law that preserves our right to safe, natural nutritional supplements, passed Congress only because of 2.5 million letters congressmen received from people like you and me who know how important nutritional products are in our country today." - Gregory, A. Gore,  Defeat Cancer  ( Get the book.  )     "Your parents (or grandparents) may have made a righteous stand against Nixon's White House, but as a post-millennial protester, your targets may include not only your own government, but also other countries' governments, multinational corporations, and even abstract alliances and trade agreements like the Group of Eight (G8) and the  world trade organization (WTO). The situation grows more complex if you believe, like the hippest factions of the protest scene, that there is no difference between corporations and countries anymore." - Alex Steffen,  Worldchanging: A User's Guide for the 21st Century  ( Get the book.  )     "European moratorium before the  world trade organization later this year," according to Samuel S. Epstein, a professor of environmental and occupational  medicine at the University of Illinois School of Public health. The Codex Alimentarius�established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, a United Nations body�is an internationally accepted set of food safety standards for raw and processed commodities.

In this, they have been strongly supported by reports from the Food and Agriculture/World Health Organization's (FAO/WHO) Joint Expert Committees on Food Additives (JECFA), including its latest September 1998 report, which unequivocally absolved rBGH from any adverse veterinary and public health effects." - Samuel S. Epstein, M.D.,  What's In Your Milk?: An Expos� of Industry and Government Cover-Up on the Dangers of the Genetically Engineered (rBGH) Milk You're Drinking  ( Get the book.  )     "Many people who protest against global institutions (such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the  world trade organization ) are protesting not against free trade but against transnational corporations' use of such institutions to control once-sovereign governments�and further diminish the power of communities. A major way to create and maintain community is through how we spend our money." - Bruce E. Levine,  Surviving America's Depression Epidemic: How to Find Morale, Energy, and Community in a World Gone Crazy  ( Get the book.  )     "Robert Zoellick submitted a protest to the World Trade Organization's Technical Barriers to Trade Committee, asserting that REACH amounted to a "non-tariff" obstacle to foreign exporters.59 At the same time, the administration sent emissaries to the new EU members like Hungary, Poland, Estonia, and the Czech Republic, formerly communist countries where environmental consciousness was far less developed than it is in Western Europe, where it tried to peel off support by claiming that REACH would make it more difficult for European firms to compete against American firms in foreign markets." - Mark Schapiro,  Exposed: The Toxic Chemistry of Everyday Products and What's at Stake for American Power  ( Get the book.  )     "When our government signed on to the  world trade organization it agreed to commit to act in accordance with the rules of this multilateral body. The United States is legally obliged to ensure national laws in America do not conflict with  world trade organization rules. The European Union set up a directive on dietary supplements. It is part of a larger forum of worldwide legislation in which the government of the United States is bound called CODEX. This will severely restrict access to natural health products in Europe and all around the world." - Kevin Trudeau,  Natural Cures They Don't Want You to Know About  ( Get the book.  )     "In 2005, Swiss citizens, who are not members of the EU, but who do provide a home to the  world trade organization , voted to ban all GMOs from cultivation in Switzerland for ten years.) The EU's ongoing reluctance to accept the unchecked import of GMOs continues to tarnish U.S.-EU relations: in May 2007, Friends of the Earth-Europe unearthed documents from the U.S. trade representative asking the European Commission to loosen its scientific review process and limit the abilities of nations and regions to impose more strict standards of GMOs than Brussels." - Mark Schapiro,  Exposed: The Toxic Chemistry of Everyday Products and What's at Stake for American Power  ( Get the book.  )     "At the  world trade organization meeting and protest in Canciin two years later I met a man from Nicaragua selling roasted coffee from his small community of Porvenir. I asked him if they roasted the coffee themselves. "Oh no, senor," he replied. "It is roasted at the Cafe Ben Linder in Leon." We also learned a lot about providing economic opportunities for people with disabilities. In 2002 I traveled to Ethiopia with Michael and Esteban." - Dean Cycon,  Javatrekker: Dispatches From the World of Fair Trade Coffee  ( Get the book.  )     "The Rise of the  world trade organization (WTO) Along with creating the United Nations, the CFR needed an economic framework to forward world trade. In 1947, the Rockefellers turned Alger Hiss loose on the problem, and Hiss led the U.S. delegation at the founding conference of the International Trade Organization (ITO) in Havana, Cuba. United States congressional leaders immediately resisted the ITO, seeing it as a charter for trade control." - Byron J. Richards,  Fight for Your Health: Exposing the FDA's Betrayal of America  ( Get the book.  ) "The group that was formed became known as the  world trade organization (WTO). The WTO controls world trade and is made up of the representatives of 120 nations. The WTO wields tremendous power over any government and the laws of any nation, because it can enforce trade penalties on a country. Enforcement is based on the votes of the nations that comprise the organization. In essence, this allows a new international government of economic interests to trump the rights of citizens in any country, including the United States." - Byron J. Richards,  Fight for Your Health: Exposing the FDA's Betrayal of America  ( Get the book.  ) "Codex never had real power until the creation of the  world trade organization (WTO) in 1995. The WTO recognizes Codex as the international authority in these matters. It provides power to Codex through threats to impose trade restrictions if Codex directives are not followed. Participation in the WTO automatically binds members, like the United States, to Codex rules. Codex takes a strong position that  vitamin supplements cannot help prevent  disease and have no place in medicine. Codex ideas are quite hostile to the millions of Americans who use alternative means of health care." - Byron J. Richards,  Fight for Your Health: Exposing the FDA's Betrayal of America  ( Get the book.  )     "The EU is moving these policies forward within the constraints imposed by the  world trade organization , premier arbiter of the values that lie behind economic conflict. The United States, were it to choose to do so, would be compelled to do the same. The main aim of the WTO and its predecessor, the Global Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), has been to create a harmonized global system for the free flow of capital and goods, detouring what are considered to be the parochial and unpredictable interests of individual nations." - Mark Schapiro,  Exposed: The Toxic Chemistry of Everyday Products and What's at Stake for American Power  ( Get the book.  )     "The movement is being promoted by multinational corporations (Big Pharma) under the  world trade organization (WTO). Their primary objective is to take over, and completely control the supplement industry. Several doctors, including Dr. Jonathan Wright, M.D., and Julian Whitaker, M.D., both of whom I highly respect, have expressed this major concern regarding the serious threat to our access of nutrients. And as I previously mentioned, 87% of the doctors who determine what will be covered by your  medical insurance are tied to the pharmaceutical industry." - Dr. David W. Tanton; Ph.D.,  A Drug-Free Approach To Healthcare, Revised Edition  ( Get the book.  )     "As long as we are members of the  world trade organization , explained Kucinich in a debate, we cannot "protect the jobs . . . this is the reason why we have outsourcing going on right now. We can't tax it. We can't put tariffs on it."2 To be nonpartisan about it, all the candidates' positions on outsourcing were preposterous or scurrilous. There were those who want to stop it. And those who saw no problem with it. Every opinion was fraudulent, delusional, or dumb. It was widely believed that the Chinese were stealing American jobs. Their factories hummed and belched smoke while U.S." - William Bonner, Addison Wiggin,  Empire of Debt: The Rise of an Epic Financial Crisis  ( Get the book.  )     "Thery, a Frenchman with an energetic passion for the power plays that lurk just behind the arcane details of trade law, had worked with Pascal Lamy, who was the director general for trade before  taking his current position as director of the  world trade organization . "I was in DG Trade back when the GE merger with Honeywell was blocked," Thery told me. "That was in 2001. Even in Europe, that was perceived as some kind of fluke, like the guy in the soccer game who accidentally kicks the ball into his own net. But it was not. This was not a mistake." - Mark Schapiro,  Exposed: The Toxic Chemistry of Everyday Products and What's at Stake for American Power  ( Get the book.  )     "The greatest impact on concerns over indigenous and local-community rights can be traced to the mercurial rise of biotechnology on the international trade front and the 1995 version of the  world trade organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). These two factors have created a large potential market for indigenous and local knowledge and resources, while at the same  time raising concerns about the  risk that these resources will be misappropriated." - Rainer W. Bussmann and Douglas Sharon,  Plants of the four winds - The magic and medicinal flora of Peru  ( Get the book.  )     "The United States is legally obligated to ensure national laws do not conflict with  world trade organization rules" including laws such as these new ones being adopted in the EU regulating our freedom to nutritional supplements. Therefore, as a member of the WTO, the U.S. will be bound by any finalized standards put forth in the EU directive. If we choose to ignore the regulations that this affiliation binds us to, we could face severe trade sanctions with other WTO countries, and damage part of our economy in our ability to export our goods overseas.
