A day after Russia signed an agreement with Georgia, overcoming its last serious obstacle to membership, the WTO’s Working Party voiced its approval for Russia’s candidacy, paving the way for a formal vote on Russia in December.   As part of Russia’s agreements to join the trade bloc, it will open up its banking system to foreign ownership of 50 percent of the capital and also allow direct branches of foreign insurance companies to be set up nine years after its accession, the WTO said. The accession date is expected to be in the first half of 2012 once it is ratified by the Russian Parliament. Tariff reductions spanning one-third of product groups must be implemented on the date of WTO accession followed by another one-third of tariffs falling within three years. Russia is the only major economy outside of the WTO, and has been trying to join the organization since 1993. The agreement of all member states is necessary for accession to the WTO, but Georgia has refused to approve Russia’s entry since the two countries fought a brief war in August 2008. Russia and Georgia finally signed a Swiss-brokered agreement on November 9, finally clearing the way for Russia’s WTO admission. Details of the agreement include the deployment of international observers to monitor the movement of goods across sections of Russia’s borders with the former Georgian republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The WTO Working Party on Russia’s accession then approved the package spelling out Russia’s terms of entry to the global trade body and recommended that Russia be admitted during the December 15-17 Ministerial Conference, where ministers are expected to approve the documents and accept Russia as a WTO Member. Russia will have until June 15, 2012 to ratify its accession package. Russia will become a full-fledged member of the WTO thirty days after the accession documents are ratified by the Russian parliament.
