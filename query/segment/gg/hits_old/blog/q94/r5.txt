Obama Administration: Shield Law Should Only Protect Journalists If We Don't Care About The Story from the  um...-wait-a-second... dept We already found it quite troubling that the Senate committee, working on a federal "shield law" that would help protect journalists from having to reveal their sources, switched from language that was pretty inclusive, to a bill that would  greatly limit the definition of a journalist to only those who work for big time journalistic endeavors. Lots of smaller, independent or amateur journalists would get no protection at all. Sen. Chuck Schumer, a sponsor of the bill, was apparently responsible for kicking out all those independent journalists. In looking into why, Jason Linkins, was told that the Justice Department  was apparently worried that everyone would just start claiming shield protection , and it would greatly limit their ability to investigate certain issues. That's a stretch, however. The law clearly could have been written in a way that would enable investigations, without removing protections over legitimate journalistic activity.  Either way, it might not matter at all. Apparently, even after all this,  the Obama administration is asking for more concessions , such as not allowing any shield protection on any instance where the administration declares that the matter involves "significant" harm to national security. Now, you can understand  why the administration would want that, but there's absolutely no oversight. Basically, under the administration's proposal, if the administration simply said there was such harm, the judge would immediately wipe out the shield.  If you want to create a chilling effect against any sort of whistleblowing on gov't corruption, that's what this proposal does. It basically lets the gov't say that the shield law only applies to whistleblowing that doesn't make the administration look bad. But, in any case where the administration isn't happy, it gets to wipe out the shield. Apparently, freedom of the press only applies to situations in which the administration is not embarrassed. 46 Comments |  Leave a Comment..

Hope, change, transparency I can see was all just a cheap line sold to a country who had the wool pulled over its eyes. Now Im not saying what the previous admin did was completely right all the time and never did any shady work or had some messed up policies. Im just saying that people should be a little more outraged at the crap they are trying to get away with because he is who he is and thats a democrat. Not trying to start a war about dems and repubs just pointing out that this admin does pretty much whatever they want with little opposition. And the whole point of free speech and freedom of the press is to be able to print for the USA to see that the government is full of crooks and cheats. Not be able to pull the "national security" card every time they are gonna be found out to be just what they all are.....evil, crooked men/women who only care about lining their own pockets.

I would say more that the Obama administration is open to the APPEARANCE of a shield law. Honestly, I haven't seen alot of "change" from the Obama admin. Seems like they're grandstanding on the healthcare issue while continuing to obscure government transparency. But let's face it, his platform was CHANGE.... he never qualified it by saying POSITIVE CHANGE. [  reply to this  |  link to this  |  view in thread  ]       Why stop there?

People gave the power to this administration far before the election. People built BO up to be almost a God-like character.  Peronally, all this scares the hell out of me because people are giving this administration the kind of power that we've seen in previous administrations that have orchestrated some of the most terrible events in history. I'm not saying it will happen with this administration, the people of this country have given away the power through rose colored glasses to a man many see as the greatest hope for change in this country.  Then, the fact that there are some real radicals lounging around in Obama's cabinet. Some of these people have real aspirations of a true socialist state, and we've all seen how well those states work.  Laws that allow the administration to keep transperancy away from the public, allow it to do things that are not legal and to limit the freedom of it's people.

This attempt to intrude on journalists in the name of "nat'l security" will probably go a long way towards controlling the mouthpieces.

[  reply to this  |  link to this  |  view in thread  ]       PrometheeFeu ( profile ),  Oct 2nd, 2009 @ 8:09am   Actually, I don't see why shield laws would not apply to national security cases. (even if there was a fair review process that determined if the case in question concerned national security) I mean, journalists either gain the info the gov't wants because they are contacted by the source in which case, if sources know shield laws won't apply, the source just won't contact the journalist and then the journalist won't have the info. Or journalists gain the info through investigation, in which case, the same investigation could be done by gov't agencies. I mean, this is basically saying that if the government says so, journalists suddenly become an investigative arm of the state. That's infringing on liberties and useless.

If the reported had a source and the source would have gotten in trouble (reprimanded/danger/death)because of what was said wouldn't the reporter natural try and protect the source. Even now the reporter could just spill the beans, its only because "the source" values the reports confidentiality that the reporter has any value to "the source" and I don't see that changing for the reporters. The shield would protect the reporter would it not? I guess I missing what the protection is from. We'll go with a overly simple example and maybe someone can explain it to me...

Anonymous Coward ,  Oct 2nd, 2009 @ 11:55am   "I don't know" is an answer that does nothing but completely invalidate your information and is the worst of all possible outcomes here. A 'journalist' without valid sources for information is spreading rumors and nothing more. To protect the ability for a journalist to provide valid information they need to have the legal standing to say 'yes I have a source with first-hand knowledge of this issue, and I will not reveal that source without their consent'. Anything short of this is useless when reporting a whistleblowing issue or other corruption/scandal story.

We'll go with a overly simple example and maybe someone can explain it to me..." You are correct that it protects the reporter from revealing the source. But it also protects the source from possible retaliation. Say you see a senator shoot a hooker in an alley, and no-one sees you. You fear for your life, but want the story to get out, and know that going to the police will only get you killed or harmed, if they believe you at all. So, you go to someone at the Washington Post, or another publication where you know you can get the story out and remain protected. Without a shield law, the journalist can be incarcerated and interrogated until they give up the source. At that point it is about the journalist code of conduct. With the shield law, the journalist is not subject to legal repercussions and no-one can ask him for the source and expect him to give it up legally. I understand that there are always people that will find extralegal methods to take care of things, but the law protects them from the courts and the police. Look at the White Water scandal. There are those in the government that would have done anything to take out the person known as deepthroat at the time. They had mercenaries out looking for the person. Luckily, he had a great journalist to keep the secret for so long. Only when he was ready was his identity revealed. [  reply to this  |  link to this  |  view in thread  ]       Re: Re: The need? Whisk33 ,  Oct 2nd, 2009 @ 1:23pm   If a source can never be verified, due to the shielding, then what use is it to have a verified source? Effectively only the reporter "knows" it can be verified. There is no check on the word of the reporter. Either way for the public, it is a disappearing post-it note, our only validation that the information presented is less than fiction is our reliability of the authenticity of the reporter.

I think my point lies in what you said when you say "until [the reporter] give[s] up the source". The subject being the reporter and the fact that they must proactively give up the source. My inadequacies of the subject revolve around a lack of understand of the legal repercussions (obstruction of justice) that one my be available to by not "giving up" the source, which I assume does not lend itself to the "post-it note" defense that I suggested... but would the "post-it note" defense work?

This is from Wikipedia, so take it for what it's worth.  Federal Judge Robert Sweet ruled on February 24, 2005 that NY Times journalist Judith Miller was not required to reveal who in the government leaked word of an impending raid to her. Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald had argued that Miller's calls to groups suspected of funding terrorists had tipped them off to the raid and allowed them time to destroy evidence. Fitzgerald wanted Miller's phone records to confirm the time of the tip and determine who had leaked the information to Miller in the first place. However, Judge Sweet held that because Fitzgerald could not demonstrate in advance that the phone records would provide the information he sought the prosecutor's needs were outweighed by a 'reporter's privilege' to keep sources confidential. The Federal Appeals Court in New York on on August 1, 2006 in a 2-to-1 decision ruled that federal prosecutors may inspect the telephone records of Miller and Philip Shenon. Judge Ralph K. Winter Jr. wrote: “No grand jury can make an informed decision to pursue the investigation further, much less to indict or not indict, without the reporters’ evidence." Journalist shield laws have been enacted in most states, but not at the federal level. These state laws vary widely but generally do not provide absolute protection, and journalists may still be compelled to testify if they have been witness to a crime or if there is no other way for the court to obtain the evidence.

It's just like in any office, the higher ups don't like to put the fate of their careers in hands of their underlings! Editors hate anonymous sources. There are plenty of closed door meetings that take place before an anonymous sourced story goes to press. However, libel isn't the issue here - the government only goes after reporters and sources when the story is true. Hence, the need for shield laws. The very first thing you learn in Journalism class is this: in exchange for freedom of the press, journalists have an obligation to serve as 'watchdogs of government' to expose corruption. It's been a back and forth battle since the inception of our country. The internet and loss of the 'barrier to entry' has really throw a wrench into things.
