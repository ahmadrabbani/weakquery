I don't need chastisement about my common sense from someone who says "Jesus also said no alcohol," when Christ's very FIRST MIRACLE was turning water into wine! You REALLY should stop lying, because you're no good at it at all. Everything you've said thus far is consistent with what a Muslim would say- yes, even "Im not in favor of any religion," since the Islamic "tekeyya" permits you to lie for the sake of furthering Islam.

Anyways, Christains are saved by grace. It is the gift of God, not due to good works, lest any one boast. This free gift inspires Christains to live good lives, not to earn Heaven, but out of thankfulness to a loving God. Muslims are more Christain than Christains? Muhammad the pedophile pretty well destroys that notion.

Christians do everything in that list...they dont follows the teachings of Jesus. its like muslims are more christians than christians themselves..

And what's with all the sex in paradise? Jesus said that people will neither marry or be given in marriage in heaven, but will be as the angels. (Matthew 22:23-30). Heaven is a place where the presence of God is all that anybody will need as there will be no more death, crying, sorrow nor pain (Revelation 21:4). Evil will not exist in any form.

Muslim videos? its called poetry. doesnt mean i have to be muslim to like a certain type of poetry. A poetry in a language other than english is a muslim video to u? Like i said i believe in god but im not favoring either religion. Respect and be respected brother. shame on you for using such language. n if arabic is "stupid" to you then you shouldnt even be posting the verses to prove your state of mind. PEACE!

The only two videos listed as your favorites are BOTH Muslim videos. I didn't "get burnt" at your Bible quote. I simply called it a red herring fallacy. Go look it up. Christians have NOT "killed the most people," you liar. In fact, Muslims have murdered more than all the Jews, Christians, Hindus, and Buddhists combined. THAT is why I criticize Islam. And if Arabic is so hard to translate, Allah was stupid for using it at all.

But you need to look at your faith before pointing out flaws in other religions.Just one quote of bible and you got burnt? hope ur aware of the fact that christians have killed the most people. most of the interpretation of arabic in english is wrong since its an ancient & different language.so the only thing i wana say is that respect others and their religion. If you cant stand it simply dont watch their videos.

I'll roll out Qur'an 5:48 in a heartbeat. You didn't provide the source for your quote up there, but it matters little- inconsistency is one of the surest signs that a message is false. Sura 4:34 permits a husband to beat his wife into submission if he feels like she's troubling him. But back to kindness: Tabari IX:113 "Treat women well, for they are like domestic animals and they possess nothing themselves."

Muslim historical sources declaring Muhammad's pedophilia with the 9-year-old Aisha: 1. Bukhari vol. 7, #65 2. Tabari IX:128-131 3. Muslim 8:3309 Respect for Christians and Jews? You're forbidden to even befriend us in Qur'an 5:51, Qur'an 2:64 calls Jews apes, and Qur'an 3:61 commands you to pray Allah's curse upon anyone who disputes Christ's divinity with you. Islam is evil. Published:  11 November 2011, 20:32 , Edited:  11 November 2011, 20:32 Written by:   nlove40   @Valtor111 then u must;ve read these? “O’ ye men. Fear Allah and treat your women with kindness.” "The world lies at feet of mothers" Muhammad(saas) here is Bible- "A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I don't permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner" (I Timothy 2:11-14).

Published:  11 November 2011, 16:09 , Edited:  11 November 2011, 16:09 Written by:   NightSurgeon09   @Valtor111 Yes, only shallow folks do that, but that does not change the fact that it happens. And not knowing the facts? I think that's you: The prophet was not a pedophile, if you look into the circumstances of his marriage with Aisha you would know that. He died with his head in her lap, he loved her and she is one of the most respected women in islam. Yaweh? The Quran teaches us to be respectful of Christians AND Jews, so I'm not going to take offence to your hatred of islam Published:  11 November 2011, 12:23 , Edited:  11 November 2011, 12:23 Written by:   Valtor111   @nlove40 "I have read Qur'an Bibe and Torah" So have I. And I've also read the Islamic Hadith collections. Bukhari: V9B89N256 "Allah's Apostle said, 'You should listen to and obey your ruler even if he is a black African slave whose head looks like a raisin.'" I take it you have not. Now, concerning women in Islam: Tabari I:280 "Allah said, 'I must also make Eve stupid, although I created her intelligent.' Because Allah afflicted Eve, all of the women of this world menstruate and are stupid."

Published:  11 November 2011, 09:23 , Edited:  11 November 2011, 09:23 Written by:   55k3v1n   @nlove40 The fact that a Muslim woman has to suffer extreme humiliation by knowing her martyr husband is rolling around in paradise with 72 teenage virgin girls is enough reason for her to run as far away from that sexist religion as she can. Imagine telling your children that daddy's in paradise having 24 threesomes or all 72 at once! How disgusting! Published:  11 November 2011, 08:52 , Edited:  11 November 2011, 08:52 Written by:   nlove40   @Valtor111 wow there hold on. i'm not a muslim but your on a wrong track i have read Qur'an Bible and Torah. In Qur'an there is no difference between a black man and a white man. On what basis are you calling it a racist religion? and women? You must be talking about ignorant societies not the religion. Women have been given many rights if you properly study Qur'an. I dont think any religion should be commented on by someone who haven't even studied it properly. Please respect other religions!  Published:  11 November 2011, 04:59 , Edited:  11 November 2011, 04:59 Written by:   Valtor111   @NightSurgeon09 Hoo boy, here we go again. 1. I am not a woman. I'm simply against oppressing them. 2. Muhammad wasn't a prophet. Prophets represent Yahweh, and are neither adulterous nor pedophiles. 3. You're at least the third person here to bash this movie for depicting Muhammad, when in fact, he is not shown in it at all. Like most Muslims, you didn't do your research first. 4. Only shallow folks make judgments based on what people looked like, instead of how they act. Published:  11 November 2011, 04:13 , Edited:  11 November 2011, 04:13 Written by:   NightSurgeon09   People, the prophet muhammed spent his life fighting against idolatry. I understand what this film trying to accomplish in a positive light. But the prophet would never have wanted a physical depiction like this to be made of him. Look at the evil that the kkk have committed, simpl because they point to a picture of Jesus that portrays him as white and say "Hey, if jesus was white, than all white people are closer to god than anyone else". It was not a good idea for this cartoon to be made.
