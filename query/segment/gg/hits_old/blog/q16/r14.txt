According to chief of Public Relations Inspector-General Abubakar Nataprawira, the content of the blog is upsetting the Moslem community. �The cyber crime unit is looking into the case,� Abubakar said in Jakarta yesterday, noting that if his identity is revealed, the blog manager will be charged with the Criminal Code on defaming a religion. �To Moslems, the content of the blog is incorrect,� Abubakar said. Communication and Informatics minister Muhammad Nuh said the government will immediately trace the owner of the blog which is potentially conflicting. �We have the technology to trace him,� Nuh said yesterday at his office. Based on Tempo's investigation, there are at least two blogs in the wordpress.com that is regarded to be insulting Muhammad and his teachings. The blog also contains various cartoon figures depicting the life of Muhammad with his wife and friends. One of the comics even shows the prophet's life and his wife inappropriately. Minister Nuh said the blogger had violated the Information and Electronic Transaction Law and the Criminal Code. He has spread issues that can lead to conflict among tribal, ethnic and religious groups. �Whether individually or in groups, the person will be penalized,� Nuh warned. Nuh said, not one religion or ethnic group likes to be provoked. �If they continue to be cornered, they will lose their patience. Justice must be served,� he said. Commissioner Raja Erizman, Jakarta Metro Police's Special Crime Investigation chief, said his department had traced the server and the blogger, which is located overseas. Raja refused to expose the country and the blogger's nationality. �So far his motive is to upset the Moslem community,� Raja said at his office.
