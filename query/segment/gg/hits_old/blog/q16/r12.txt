Several young Muslims have since been convicted in Denmark of planning bomb attacks, partly in protest at the cartoons.     An editorial in left-leaning Politiken called the murder plot "shocking and troubling."           "Their plans to kill Kurt Westergaard... are not just an attack on Westergaard but an attack on our democratic culture," The editorial said.     "Regardless of whether Jyllands-Posten at the time used freedom of speech unwisely and with damaging consequences, the paper deserves unconditional solidarity when it is threatened with terror," It said.     "That is why Politiken today... prints the drawing, even though at no time have we sympathized with Jyllands-Posten's provocation."       Tweet        talkback          Print          Send to friend             Bookmark to del.icio.us              27 Talkbacks for this article       See all talkbacks                 Please wait for the talkbacks to load                            RSS  |   About  |   Contact Us  |    Privacy Policy  |   Terms of use  |   Advertise with us   Site developed by          Copyright © Yedioth Internet.
