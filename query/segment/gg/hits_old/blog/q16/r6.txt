Muslim bodies are demanding that the books be withdrawn and immediate action be taken against the same. According to Syed Maulana Hashmi Kichachauvi, the founder, Sunni Markaz, the portrayal of Prophet Mohammad is in book 'Moral Education Ethics' and the lesson "Being good and gentle". He also claimed that the eight lakh copies which have already been distributed in the market should be withdrawn immediately and called for an apology from the government in three days. "Otherwise we would be forced to take the help of the court and launch protest through democratic means," he said addressing the reporters. The maulana said, a case against the publisher and the board should be filed if the picture was published without the centre's knowledge. "Islam prohibits depiction through photo and presenting it in a cartoon form is also a show of disrespect," he added. “This is blasphemy. No Muslim will accept this," he said. Criticising Kapil Sibal, the maulana said that it was the mistake of the HRD Minster and asked for his resignation and take moral responsibility for committing a grave mistake.
