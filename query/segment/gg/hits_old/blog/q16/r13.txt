Or good at marketing their repressive urges. Their latest target is in South Africa, home of next month's World Cup, the planet's biggest sports event. Last Friday the Johannesburg Mail & Guardian published the quite funny cartoon reproduced above by the irascible Zapiro, whose name might rhyme with Rabelais or Voltaire in another language, and whose cartoons have the range of satirical insurgents on speed. No target is too sacred. A couple of weeks back he lampooned South African President Jacob Zuma's  sharing his HIV test results publicly. On April Fool's day he drew three children crucified by prelates as the pope "washes his hands off child abuse." No word from the Vatican on whether that dead-on hammering offended the church's sensibilities. And if it did: tough. Cartoonists don't draw to be submissive to the day's scandals and conventions. The moment they start doing so, they might as well go illustrate corporations' annual reports. Segments of South Africa's Muslim community doesn't get it. Reigning Islamic dogmas have it that the Prophet Muhammad, who was known to be neither unfunny nor modest, is not to be depicted in portraiture or any other sort of imagery. You won't find that prohibition in the Koran. But the descendants of prophets, since well before Christ's time, are notorious control freaks, which at least gives clerics and theologian plenty to do. The South African objection to Zapiro's cartoon is not only that it depicts the prophet, getting psychoanalyzed no less, but that it is "blasphemous, insulting, insensitive, and hurtful to the Muslim community and that the publication offends the religious convictions of the community." First, a word about Muhammad being psychoanalyzed. Any objection to the scene reeks of hypocrisy. Muhammad has been on the analyst's couch for 1,300 years. He's one of the most analyzed, psychoanalyzed and para-psychologically analyzed creatures that ever walked this earth. The  Sunnah and the Hadith as ascribed to the prophet are, like the Christian gospels, in good part psychological, retroactive fill-in-the-blank exercises by the prophet's disciples, most or all of whom had no direct knowledge of him, all of whom were codifying a portrait of Muhammad that attempted to flesh him out in their image as much as it mythologized him. When great and influential human beings die, they don't go away. They go to the couch. The objection regarding blasphemy and insensitivity is more common, if still no more valid. Muslims have every right to be offended over the depiction of the prophet. They have absolutely no right to impose that standard of offense on those who don't share their beliefs and sensibilities. Granted, there are matters of good taste. Some of the  original Muhammad cartoons , the ones that triggered the franchise now known as Muhammad cartoon controversies, included a couple that were outright disgusting, namely the one showing Muhammad with a Pink Panther  vintage bomb in his turban and another showing Muhammad  wielding a murderous dagger as he is flanked by two women in burqas. Vulgar, false, insulting. But no less up to the cartoonist to draw, and the newspaper that published them to have the freedom to run them. If you don't like them, turn the damn page. Don't buy the paper. Boycott it if you like. Organize a boycott. But attempt to block cartoons from running? Go to court to squash them, as South Africa's Muslims did? No defense for that. Not unless Islam wants to identify itself with Stalinist Russia and the Medieval repressions of the Catholic church (when Islam was far, far more enlightened than the church and its practitioners in many places anticipated the European Enlightenment by a few centuries.) Zapiro did nothing more than his job, which is to turn convention on its head, force people to question their basic assumptions, and do so with great humor. He got the idea from a new Facebook page called " Everybody Draw Muhammad Day! " The page was created just a few days ago, with this brief explanation: "May 20th 2010 is draw Mohammed day! Help spread knowledge about this important day - invite your friends! When on this page, drawing pictures or discussing: We strongly encourage you not to use this page as an excuse for hate speech." The page quickly drew more than 100,000 fans--and was just as quickly censored in Pakistan . The page also lost its original founders, who obviously did not anticipate the storm they'd be causing. That's beside the point. Pakistan's ban of Facebook, and YouTube and Wikipedia subsequently, over something as silly and ridiculously cartoonish as that Muhammad page is the equivalent of slamming a burqa on Pakistan's internet access. What's worse is Facebook's subsequent  censoring of itself in India , for fear of losing business. Pitiful. And all because of a few drawings. As for Muslims takiung up daggers and clubs and rioting their anger away, as they have in previous explosions of rage over the Muhammad cartoons, with blood and a few deaths to the rioters' credit--those excesses are permitted. Those murderous spree, more heinous than any Muhammad drawing could ever be, are justified and defended in the twisted logic of zealotry. So excuse me if I show little sympathy for South Africa's zealots. They're treading old, bloody ground, and the blood is on their conscience, not on that of any cartoonist. Don't let them fool you with their false pieties and frothy presumptions.

True to the core.  May 25, 2010 at 3:43 am (2) Safia   : This entire situation reeks of hypocrisy on the part of the promoters of ‘freedom of expression’  If you are so big on it, why not publish a few cartoons which mock events surrounding the holocaust and see where that gets you.  Every right is bound to particular responsibilities: to ensure that your rights do not infringe on those of others for starters! Such actions serve no purpose other than to incite and provoke, with dire consequences.  Let me put it simply: ANY depictions of the Prophet are prohibited in the teachings of Islam regardless of how humorous people who have no attachment to him might find them. This is a belief held by one in four people on planet earth. It’s time they were respected.  May 25, 2010 at 5:04 am (3) jane doe   : Safia- I’ve seen many cartoons ridiculing the Holocaust. Why not a few mocking slavery? Or lynching black people Of comparing Africans to apes? Or making fun of Bosnian(aka the Muslims) genocide? I see plenty of mocking killing Jews- but none of mocking killing Muslims, Arabs, or Africans. Let’s change that, shall we?  May 25, 2010 at 5:06 am (4) jane doe   : “This entire situation reeks of hypocrisy on the part of the promoters of �freedom of expression� If you are so big on it, why not publish a few cartoons which mock events surrounding the holocaust and see where that gets you. ” YOU reak of hypocrasy. Why do you always refer to a miniscule slight as being as bad as making fun of killing Jews? Why not compare it to making fun of killing Mandela? Or black people?   May 25, 2010 at 6:41 am (5) Charles   : Safia….. truth hurts…it does… did you know that your prophet Mohamed…slaughtered a whole Jewish tribe. Now days it would be called a atrocity against man kind…the Qurayza Jews. 900 of men separated from the woman and children whom were forced in conversion…the men…beheaded violently…and all dumped into a ravine….sick wouldn’t you say….  May 25, 2010 at 10:52 am (6) o'raly   : Cartoons are only the iceberg tip Muslims �do and do not actions Do: Outrage against cartoons Do not: Antiterorisms demonstration Do: Building Mosks worldwide Do not:Permit building of non Islam praying homes in many Muslim controlled areas Do: Demanding freedom for all aspects of Muslim culture worldwide Do not: Demand Muslim recognition of free&peaceful coexistence among all cultures Do: Demand free Islamic preaching Do not: Stop incitement& individual Jihad against the host country  May 25, 2010 at 2:41 pm (7) Mohamed   : To the person who wrote this article: I’m quoting this from your article: On April Fool’s day he drew three children crucified by prelates as the pope “washes his hands off child abuse.” No word from the Vatican on whether that dead-on hammering offended the church’s sensibilities.” I think you don’t even know the fundamentals of human rights before stating something of it. If your religious people don’t care about your own religion or your Jesus Christ, that’s your problem. If Vatican doesn’t care about what kind of fun others make of Christinanity or your Sexy God (wearing nothing but underwear while hanging on the holy cross), you should first talk Vatican since you have a serious issue. This doesn’t mean that we should be careless of our prophet or religion too. We don’t I repeate we don’t follow YOU Mr Genius, we follow our beloved Prophet. Our prophet belong to us since we are the only ones who follow him. He’s our property. Therefore it’s our right to defend him / his name / his character at all costs. These are the fundamentals of human rights. So Mr. Genius, why don’t you take a few classes before lecturing others? Apart from that, you mentioned that “Koran” never prohibits portraiture of Prophet Muhammad. First of all it’s not “Koran” Mr. Genius, it’s “Qur’an”. You don’t even know how to pronounce the name of the book you’re trying to get evidence from. Learn first Mr. Genius; then teach. Islam clearly prohibits drawing / painting / sculpting of the Prophet Muhammad and the prophets before him (including the “Real Jesus”; not your fake one). If you think you know too much about Islam or your own religion, why don’t we setup a public debate in any topic in either Islam or Christianity or both? Are you human enough?  May 25, 2010 at 3:47 pm (8) Ahmad   : Evil, they are and evil they will be. WTF is the freedom of expression. If you draw Jesus and kill his characted its your problem, Muslims won’t tolerate attack on their prophet, who is more dear to them than their lives and families.  May 29, 2010 at 12:49 am (9) fuad j   : another fool with his proudly content on the net. Muslim never provoke other religious people, why are we always be targeted???  June 1, 2010 at 9:32 pm (10) Paul   : Yet another demonstration why Islam is rooted in the past. We (Christians) may be ‘Infidels’ but you ‘Muslims’ are barbarians. You don’t see Catholics rioting over cartoons. Grow up, get modern and learn to roll with the punches. Otherwise, you will be forever rooted in the Middle Age. Where you seem to be stuck.

Why god has created to the human being? just for fun? Never! Introspect & find reality! May ALMIGHTY show you true path!  September 18, 2010 at 10:54 pm (13) Todd G Allen   : my favorite cartoon of the false prophet muhammad, is of him and his pet pig, someone should have told him you can love your pig not LOVE your pig.i guess he wont need 71 virgins, as he prefers pork. and if you dont like my free speech then go back to your stupid country, im also not politically correct. so screw you and the camel you rode in on you sand jockey, or come to Indiana and ill be glad to send you to hell with your false prophet. i served my country and take my oath to defend it very seriously. im on the east side of Indianapolis, write if you need directions im also listed in the phone book. allen_intl@yahoo.com   October 11, 2010 at 4:31 pm (14) Ghulam Mustafa   : This is simple to understand the people who dont have parents(( illegal birth )) Can not know about the respecting elders then how they will respect prophets? We all know 70% of You people are generation of an accident,a mishap,or bad experience of your mothers We r expecting same attitude on yourside.Not an amazement by Us,Even you proved our theory.
