Our cartoon is of  Muhammad Ali , the former world champion boxer. We use this Muhammad Ali cartoon to teach students the Spanish word for  almost , which is   casi  , because it sounds like CASSI-us Clay, which was Muhammad Ali's original name. The cartoon shows Muhammad Ali -  CASSI-us Clay when he was  almost  knocked out by Henry Cooper.  casi  means  almost in Spanish.  CASSI-us Clay was   almost  knocked out by British boxer Henry Cooper. ©Transcity Properties Ltd trading as Exceltra    Celebrities and famous people make it easier to remember... By using  celebrities and  famous people from history we are able to  more quickly learn and better remember new words, and phrases. We use loads of them in our cartoons... from  Abe Lincoln to  George Bush to  Eminem to  Michael Jordan ... singers, actresses, models, sports stars, politicians, criminals ... you name it. For nouns we also use these characters to remind us of the  gender (or sex) of the noun, for those languages that have genders. In these languages all nouns (things) are either masculine or feminine, and it can be quite a job to remember which is which. Languages using genders are   French ,  Spanish ,  German ,  Welsh , and   Italian  . But we make it easy with our cartoons like our  Muhammad Ali cartoon . For nouns, if the word is  masculine our cartoon's main character is male , and if a word is  feminine, our cartoon's main character is female . ... and furthermore, the voices that narrate the words are male for masculine and female for feminine, using  native speakers for the target foreign language voices. Each and every word in our courses has a unique  Memory Trigger © with a cartoon like our Mohammad Ali cartoon. So, as CASSI-us Clay is a male, is   casi  a masculine or feminine word? Of course, you did not fall for that one... It's neither, because it's not a  noun !
