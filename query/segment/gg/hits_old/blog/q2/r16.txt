"The challenge is going to be is to make that recovery be as strong and robust as we can," he said at the  First Draft of History conference in Washington D.C. Summers said the unemployment numbers weren't a surprise, as "the process of convalescence is never…completely smooth." Still, he said, "we're in a very different place than we were nine months ago."   He pointed to a decline in the rate of job loss and positive GDP growth, and noted that "discussions of Depression that were pervasive nine months ago aren't where the economy is" today. The Obama administration advisor acknowledged, however, that "it's going to be a while" before the economy is completely back on track, adding: "We've got an enormous amount to do." Summers, following the lead of Vice President Joe Biden, praised the effects of the economic stimulus package, saying it kept policemen and teachers from losing their jobs. He said there was still progress to be made in areas such as digitizing medical records, stating that the average hospital has worse information technology capabilities than the average supermarket.  Summers declined to directly address questions about a second stimulus package, saying he doesn't know exactly what the phrase means. He said "we certainly need to continue to support people who are in need," and stressed the importance of "continuing public investments." Asked about the budget deficit, he said it's an important issue but suggested that it isn't a reason to refrain from public investment.  "We're not going to have a healthy budget in a profoundly unhealthy economy," he said.  Asked if  companies should be allowed to be "too big to fail," Summers said regulatory reform was "absolutely essential." He pointed to the need for higher capital standards, a "harmonization of regulation" and resolution authority.  Summers said officials should never again be in the position of having to decide between a "problematic bailout" and "chaos and collapse."

Oh, and don't forget the former Enron Employees! Hey, the worst is over folks! www.hatecards.net Reply to this comment             by  sjc_1  October 3, 2009 1:33 PM EDT  Bush was AWOL in Crawford, Texas a lot of the time. If they were trying to have an Olympics in Dallas, you would have seen him and the first lady over there. Try to be a bit more honest in your attempts at slanting and biasing your arguments. Reply to this comment             by  valwayne  October 2, 2009 10:33 PM EDT  Unemployment keep shooting up and is getting to a level where it may kill any possible recovery. Yet we have VP Biden saying the corrupt stimulous bill worked beyond their wildest dreams? And Summer says the worst has passed. I guess if your Commander in Chief is AWOL in Copenhangen and you're stuck responding to the horrible news you try and put the best light on it? But this is a joke! 9.8% UNEMPLOYMENT, We are truly on the road to hell! Reply to this comment             by  stn_sage  October 2, 2009 7:49 PM EDT  So, 'the worst is passed', huh? LMAO. Sure, it is.  Just keep saying that, buddy! Maybe by saying it, you can 'give it life'! I got news for you---the worst hasn't gotten here---YET!

Reply to this comment            by  stn_sage  October 2, 2009 7:46 PM EDT  You're absolutely correct! I don't know if it will be a 'bloodbath' in 2010/2012, but at the rate the Dems are ruling against America and Americans and in favor of big business, it very well could be!  And, you're right, they would deserve it, too!                    by  sjc_1  October 2, 2009 4:16 PM EDT  First of all the ARRA is NOT a stimulus program, it is a recovery program. The stimulus plan was done by Bush in 2008 when he sent $140 billion in checks to tax payers that mostly went to buy big screen TVs made in Asia at Wal-Mart.  Second, Larry Summers is an adviser. He is not Treasury and he is not the Federal Reserve. Mr. Summers IS a very smart guy that was ONCE Treasury Secretary after Robert Rubens stepped down. He knows what he is talking about. At times he may be too out spoken and may not use all the right words to say it, but he IS very smart and capable.

That is what I meant.                    by  stuart-johns1  October 2, 2009 3:22 PM EDT  Well I agree that the stimulus IS working in spite of what republican extremist trolls like BubbaWrong say. We did avoid a national catastrophe in not allowing the largest recession in history from taking us into a terrible depression.  But still, be that as it may, I am not sure Mr. Sumner, that the worst is over. Reply to this comment            by  stuart-johns1  October 2, 2009 3:23 PM EDT  I meant Mr. Summers.                    by  BubbaRight  October 2, 2009 3:15 PM EDT  Your Stimulus Plan ain't workin' Larry. All those "shovel ready" jobs aren't happening. Looks like Keynesian economics is dead. Reply to this comment            by  Stop_the_crying  October 5, 2009 12:03 PM EDT  Oh So Sorry, Charlie. The bad generated by bush is being fixed by the Prez. I bet Bubbaright has a shot gun in his pickup window!!!!!! Really irritates Bubbaright.....RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!
