Monday, April 11, 2011   Larry Summers is a New Monetarist    In  this discussion, which  Mark Thoma links to, you can see Larry Summers talking with Martin Wolf about the current state of macroeconomics. Summers professes an interest in academic papers that use words like "leverage, liquidity, deflation, and depression." Excellent! We like those words too. Summers also expresses some admiration for intermediation theory and, in particular, the Diamond-Dybvig model (he doesn't name it, but it's clear that is what he is referring to). Very good, we use that thing too. He also likes Tobin's ideas, some of which I certainly find interesting. He also claims to shy away from papers that use words like "choice theoretic" and "optimizing model of..." Surely we would think of Tobin-Markowitz as choice-theoretic, and everyone is optimizing in a Diamond-Dybvig model. Seems that Larry is confused.

April 12, 2011 7:01 PM               Stephen Williamson said...  Well, we're stuck with it now. There are New Keynesians, so we thought we would be New Monetarists.

I will stipulate that Pythagoras didn't have an interest in economics -- that I know of -- but he did like math and his followers had some good insights into triangles.  And Pythagoras didn't have any economic beliefs that proved misplaced --- that I know of -- so the name comes with no baggage, unlike New Keynesians or New Monetarists.

Just call yourselves Manchester United. They get better looking chicks.    April 18, 2011 7:14 PM               Stephen Williamson said...  My wife is upset with you.
