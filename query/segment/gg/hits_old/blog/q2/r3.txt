Wed, Nov 16, 2011, 11:44 PM EST - U.S. Markets closed            Sponsored by             Larry Summers: Debt Got Us Into This Mess and Debt Will Get Us Out By   Aaron Task    Posts  Website  RSS       By   Aaron Task  |   Daily Ticker   –  Fri, Oct 28, 2011 10:32 AM EDT          Follow The Daily Ticker on Facebook here!    At The Economist's  Buttonwood Gathering in lower Manhattan this week, the prevailing mood was in opposition to the euphoria in the financial markets. The odds of a 'double-dip' recession have declined in recent weeks thanks to Europe's latest bailout and another round of better-than-expected economic data, but "the risk is still there and I don't think there's a foundation for growth that will significantly bring down unemployment," Larry Summers tells me in the accompanying clip. "Unless we're able to get more demand going, we're not going to generate the incomes necessary to have growth to allow us to move forward." In order to stimulate demand, the former Treasury Secretary and President Obama's chief economic advisor says the keys are infrastructure spending, tax cuts for middle-income families and relief for struggling homeowners via refinancing and/or mortgage modification. On these issues, Summers says the President is "very much on the right track" with his recent proposals. In addition, and somewhat controversially, Summers also believes in the beneficial power of ( wait for it ) debt. Debt Is Good?   "The central irony of financial crisis is that while it is caused by too much confidence, too much borrowing and lending and too much spending, it can only be resolved with more confidence, more borrowing and lending, and more spending," Summers writes in a  recent op-ed in The Financial Times . In the accompanying video, I asked Summers whether that's the equivalent of trying to drink yourself sober. His answer, essentially, is that after a period when credit flowed too freely and people were overly eager about taking risk, the pendulum has now swung too far in the other direction. "The reason firms aren't hiring is they don't have demand; the only way they'll get demand is to have more spending; the only way people will spend more is if they have access to credit," he says. "We have to work through the old debts to enable people to take on new debts." Check the accompanying video for more and to hear Summers' (brief) thoughts on the Occupy Wall Street movement.

I guess Larry is unfamiliar with the diminishing marginal productivity of debt. http://12160.info/forum/topics/the-most-important-chart-of?commentId=2649739%3AComment%3A300136           Nicholas    2 weeks ago   It has been suggested that Larry Summers was one of the people who got us into this mess (Glass-Steagall, etc). It would be nice if he'd get us out ... but don't hold your breath.           Bullocks    2 weeks ago   Larry Summers buried the financial system by advocating for the repeal of Glass-Stegall. Before 1999, investment banks went under all the time and they didn't cause the collapse of the economy. It wasn't until they got too big to fail that Wall Street was able to hold the world hostage with its stupid financial engineering. Why anyone, especially a president, would listen to him anymore his beyond me. He's one of those guys that are so book smart, they are a complete #$%$           norton    2 weeks ago   Translation; "We have to have debt slaves so they are reliant on the government. We cannot have people actually saving and spending within their means, that would mean they are free." Summers is a douchbag.           Mark    6 days ago   What a complete and total idiot - haven't we, as a nation, been piling debt on top of debt already. How's that working out for the national checkbook.           joe b    2 weeks ago   "We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them." - Albert Einstein           Daemonicus    2 weeks ago   A credit based economy is doomed to collapse under the weight of the debt. Ask Greece.           John    2 weeks ago   The insanity continues.... how about saving and spending your own money instead of borrowed money,which is what responsible people do,and borrowing within their repayment means only when needed!           CommonCents    2 weeks ago   Wow! No wonder the government is so $crewed up, with Larry's illogical thinking!!!!!           s k    2 weeks ago   Larry should just stay in the Ivy League Economic "Clean Rooms" where their moronic ideas only work. You know they probably Welcomed him back with Great Fanfare after being part of an Crack-Super-Economic-Misfit-Team, that destroyed our economy. F!Ing Morons they all are...           joseph    2 weeks ago   Larry you suck you lying #$%$           william formerly choo cho ...    2 weeks ago   A Harvard Proff??? This guy is an idiot!!!

Welcome to the third world America!!! Viva Colombia!           DH    2 weeks ago   He says the president is on the right track compared to the 80% of Americans who think we are on the wrong track. This is media propoganda at it's best, what is this crap?           giat    2 weeks ago   Larry Summers is a bad as George Soros. These people are  have tried to destroyed this country in order to make the Government control it's people (SOCIALISM). He like the President have no clue they just talk their talk, DON'T LISTEN OR BELIVE THEM.           Michael    2 weeks ago   Hey Larry say hello to Moe for me. People could spend more if their taxes were reduced and inflation were under control. Their are people who only spend what they make as incredible it may be for you to comprehend.           joe b    2 weeks ago   I did the same thing with my credit cards. I kept getting offers for balance transfers and keep rolling over the debt. Eventually I filed for bankruptcy...problem solved!!           moi    2 weeks ago   With people like this sort of thinking in power positions, I can only reach one conclusion, America is doomed.           StraightShooter    2 weeks ago   I think Larry is a (brain) dead ringer for the next "Dumb and Dumber" movie.           Hypocritesparadise.com    2 weeks ago   Spoken like a true Keynesian. Spend spend spend. Debt does not create wealth...saving does.           eric    2 weeks ago   What a joke, where do these sellouts come from? I mean I am no "economist" by any means, but even I can see this is absolute rubbish. It makes me even sadder that this Imbecile gets paid to spout this misleading garbage.          More     Post a comment      Editors' Picks  The Future of Apple Without Steve Jobs  The only thing we know is: things will be different.
