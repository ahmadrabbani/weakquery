You should know by now I’m no fan of the formulaic and unnecessarily grisly crime yarns and fell off the “ER” train some time ago. Aaron Sorkin’s “West Wing” was just so good, it almost spoiled everything else on broadcast TV by comparison. If people called during the broadcast back in the days before TiVo, that more primitive recording was employed: the phone answering machine. After TiVo, you’d rewind parts of it to savor the language or the jokes; toward the end, you’d rewind it just to get a clue of what they were talking about so speedily as they bolted down hallways (Uswhatistan?).  That dash down the hallway style, allowed by the development of the SteadiCam, made “West Wing” seem like the national civics variation of “ER,” which carried on its breathless  conversations on the run in the same manner. There were quirks in it that were annoying, but only because other episodes were so sterling. Succumbing to the temptation of a season finale assassination attempt seemed too obvious; having President Bartlet turn hawk as the years went on a disingenuous way to have the show reflect the increasingly conservative stance of the country (and maybe the corporation showing it?). Nobody will make anything like “The West Wing” anytime soon; “Commander in Chief” in its first episodes, came close; Rod Lurie’s script and vision had a certain style. But after he was relieved of his job, “Commander” became so conventional as to become missable (Now it’s been yanked for May sweeps and is unlikely to return next season). Some assailed the impossible optimism and ideals of the staff, but you have to believe that they must feel that way in order to work so hard at their jobs (none had a private life, not even the President who lived upstairs); it was stirring, too, that Sorkin showed that same optimism in Democratic ideals and doing the right thing, a notion his successor John Wells mostly stuck with (after an admittedly shaky transition). Though Wells fell a little too in love with the presidential election process – stretching out nearly as long as the interminable real thing, dangling the possibilities of the series continuing with a new, hot president and a new cabinet and staff. But John Spencer’s death and the dwindling ratings in its new early Sunday time slot meant that it would have the elegant closure Sunday with the changing of the guard.       1 Comments By  Dave on   May 15, 2006 2:14 PM     I felt, that during the Sorkin years the dialogue was the best in TV, elevating the show and the viewer. I too was attracted by the general optimism of being a public servant and in times when the real life pols are held in such low regard{many deservedly so} this was refreshing. I think the shift toward making Sheen more of a hawk, was un-avoidable. In post 9-11, there was no way the show survives if he was portrayed as a dove, although, the series of episodes that lead to Leo's heart attack, showed Bartlett refusing to give in to both sides of the mid-east problems and was certainly "dovish". I will greatly miss this show, especially Sheen who was a master.        ABOUT  Roger Catlin is TV critic for the Hartford Courant and writes a daily column about what's on television called TV Eye.
