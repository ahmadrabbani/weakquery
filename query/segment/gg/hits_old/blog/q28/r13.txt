This is a joint initiative between Melbourne Central and West Space, and we are excited about the different possibilities that might arise through presenting an artistic program in this unique location.   The satellite space, which has the current working title the ‘West Wing’, will be programmed for an initial 6-months and is being offered free of charge to artists. The space, which is currently vacant retail space, is around 50m2 and will relatively easily support cross-artform practices.  West Space will present an experimental and diverse artistic program at the Melbourne Central site – offering unique possibilities for artists and offering visitors to Melbourne Central an experience different to the retail experience they expect.    West Space is currently seeking proposals for the West Wing. Information about proposals:   - The space is free.   - It is available 24-hours, 7-days per week.   - The space is approximately 50 square metres. A basic floor plan will be available shortly and higher resolution images can be found on our website at  www.westspace.org.au    - This is an open call for proposals.  Proposals may be in any form – your proposal may, for instance:   - be an exhibition, performance, audiovisual project, artist talk, research project     - be an onsite ‘artist in residence’ program – you may use the space as a studio for a number of weeks   - be individual or group proposal. Group proposals are encouraged.     - Proposals may be submitted at any time – however because we are programming quickly there is a sense of ‘first come, first served’   - In keeping with West Space’s artistic vision, preference will be given to contemporary art projects that are experimental, exploratory, cross artform and critically engaged. We seek to represent diverse and experimental artforms, artists and approaches to art.   - The artists must cover all production needs. We do not have a production budget. West Space will support production as much as possible (lights, audiovisual equipment, invigilation, etc), however we must stress that West Space has limited production resources and these are mostly in use at our Anthony Street premises.   - West Space, in conjunction with Melbourne Central, will advertise and promote the projects.  Please note that:   - Preference will be given to projects that involve continued on-site activity. We can work with projects to assemble volunteer invigilators as much as possible, however projects that are relatively self-sufficient and that involve active participation of the space are preferred.   - Projects must work sympathetically with the context and the audience of Melbourne Central. Artists must be prepared to engage with the general public.   - Limited spaces are available. Projects will be selected at the discretion of West Space – this is an experimental pilot program that we hope may continue into the future. Unfortunately we won’t be able to house all projects – like all West Space programs, we will take care to balance the program in order to feature diverse artforms and artists.  Please go to  www.westspace.org for information about submissions, and to download the submission form.  For further information please email  westwing@westspace.org.au .
