The article analyzes one full season of the television show the West Wing to examine the three main presidential depictions in the show: the president as  chief executive , the president as candidate, and the president as  private citizen . Through this analysis, the authors aim to examine the role of framing in  political communication . We will see that while the paper is well written and  thoroughly researched , in the end the entire paper rests on a faulty premise and is thus not a valuable contribution to the field. The authors begin the article by noting that despite the pervasive news coverage of the American presidency, citizens do not generally gain access to the behind the scenes reality of the daily life of the president. The authors then make a very tenuous assertion, upon which their entire article is based: they assert that "the West Wing provides audience members with a view of the internal workings of the  White House . This fictional show offers something to the American public that it cannot get from any other source: an insider's view of what it is like to be president on a daily basis" (Holbert et al, 506). This problematic statement is offered up front, without any kind of explanation of the short                                                    Related Essays    Analysis: A Novel Approach to Politics     .... this manner, the real of the  presidency - flawed human .... the facts of politics to the  American public in ....

This sentence is problematic on many levels. First, it opens with a conditional statement justifying their study that is predicated on the belief that cartoon characters are more important for political communication than news anchors something that is well beyond the accepted norms. Second, it ascribes some deeper relevance to the West Wing than other television shows, saying that it clearly pushes the envelope between fact and fiction. In reality, the show is clearly fiction and is only loosely based on the actual  political process . In arguing for the importance of the West Wing, the authors note its popularity, the fact that it has won many awards, and its longevity. They assert that "the picture of the American presidency offered on the program is qualitatively distinct from the messages citizens engage when consuming news content" (509). But of course, this would have to be true as it is a fictional show and not a real depiction of the presidency a fact the authors fail to point out. They also note that the show's creator and main writer "has made it clear that he does not wish for the program to reflect the most pressing policy issues facing the nation" (510).
