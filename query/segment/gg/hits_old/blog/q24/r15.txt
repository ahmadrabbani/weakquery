The Texas governor, one of many Republicans who has accused the president of calling his fellow citizens "lazy" after the president told CEOs over the weekend that Americans have "been a little bit lazy" about selling the country as a place for foreign investment, elaborated on his view in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News.  "He grew up in a privileged way," Perry said. "He never had to really work for anything, he never had to go through what Americans are going through," Perry said, theorizing that Obama's upbringing is what distances him Americans.  "This president has never felt that angst that they felt in their heart."

The incident happened when several journalists who have been covering Cain regularly tried to film the candidate as he was returning to his campaign bus after an event here. As the journalists trailed Cain, a man in plain clothes blindsided National Journal/CBS News reporter Lindsey Boerma into the side of the campaign bus. Moments later, as journalists circled around the bus toward Cain, the same man stuck his arm out and clothes-lined Boerma. The man refused to identify himself. He implied he was a police officer when he suggested that one of his "buddies" in uniform could give the reporter a ride in the back of a police car. When other journalists began videotaping him, he pulled out his cell phone and started recording the press. "I'm an independent reporter," he said. Afterwards, Lt. Joe McHugh of the Coral Springs Police Department identified the man as one of his officers and defended his actions. "The reporter was running up along the side of the bus with no identification on identifying herself as a reporter," McHugh said. "So the officer stuck his arm out to prevent her from getting to Mr. Cain and at which time he was successful." Boerma was not wearing press tags but was carrying a video camera with a plainly visible CBS decal. She is a member of a team of reporters covering the presidential candidates for National Journal and CBS News.

The vote was 272 to 154.  The National Rifle Association-backed measure had the backing of the vast majority of Republicans along with a coalition of pro-gun rights Democrats.  A matching bill has not been brought forward in the Democrat-led Senate. But gun rights advocates have previously nearly-successfully attempted to attach a similar measure to unrelated legislation.  Every state except Illinois and the District of Columbia allow residents to carry concealed weapons, the Associated Press reports, but states have varying standards for issuing permits to do so.   Backers of the measure say concealed carry permits should be treated the same as drivers' licenses, and argue that Second Amendment rights should not be constrained by state boundaries.

(Credit: Pool,AP Photo/Rick Rycroft)  CANBERRA, Australia -- President Obama insisted on his visit to Australia that the U.S. does not fear China even as he announced for the first time  a sustained American military presence in Australia .    Mr. Obama said the U.S. was "here to stay."  The agreement is a major symbol of American intentions to use our half-century long alliance with Australia to counter-balance the rising economic and military power of China.

Rob Portman, R-Ohio, is pursued by reporters as he turns into a restricted corridor in the Capitol for closed-door talks with fellow Republican members of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2011.  (Credit: AP)  With just one week left to identify $1.2 billion in savings, Democrats and Republicans on the bipartisan Congressional "supercommittee" are deeply at odds -- not just over policy, but over whose move it is.  "I am still hopeful that the Republicans will see their way to bringing to us a real revenue package," Democratic Senator Patty Murray said Wednesday, as she headed out of yet another meeting with the five other Democrats on the committee.  But her co-chair on the supercommittee, Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling, insisted a few hours later that the ball was actually in the Democrats' court. "I'm waiting for the Democrats to put fundamental reform on the table. I'm not going to negotiate against myself," Hensarling said during a break from his meeting with fellow Republican supercommittee members.

(The U.S. Debt Clock  website  also shows the national debt above $15 trillion, though that site is only an estimate based on actual amounts from 2010 and projected totals from 2011. As CBS News' Mark Knoller points out, the debt doesn't actually continuously rise, as the Debt Clock site suggests; it is based on daily revenues and expenses by the government, and the official number sometimes declines.)    Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain said in response to the news that President Obama's "disastrous economic policies are not only an economic travesty, they are immoral."

Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., speaks during the Iowa Republican Party's Ronald Reagan Dinner, Friday, Nov. 4, 2011, in Des Moines, Iowa.  (Credit: Michele Bachmann, Iowa)  WEBSTER CITY, Iowa - Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann took aim at primary rival Newt Gingrich on Wednesday, criticizing the former House speaker of "shilling" for mortgage giant Freddie Mac after he left Congress.  Gingrich has been under attack for his consulting work for the mortgage finance giant, a controversy that boiled over Wednesday after Bloomberg News report Tuesday that he made over $1.6 million over eight years as a consultant for Freddie Mac after leaving Congress in early 1999. Gingrich would have been under contract when the housing market bubble burst in 2006, an event that some policymakers say was helped along by the twin mortgage entities Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. "Fannie and Freddie, as you know, have been the epicenter of the financial meltdown in this country," Bachmann said. "And whether former Speaker Gingrich made $300,000 or whether he made $2 million, the point is that he took money to influence senior Republicans to be favorable toward Fannie and Freddie. While he was taking that money I was fighting against Fannie and Freddie."

After video of the president making that comment is shown in the ad, Perry, standing outside in a casual shirt, addresses the camera. "Can you believe that?" he says. "That's what our President thinks wrong with America? [sic] That Americans are lazy? That's pathetic." (Perry appears to have omitted an "is" from his comments.)  Perry goes on to say "it's time to clean house in Washington," an argument that squares with his  recent call to overhaul all three branches of government , a proposal that includes making being a member of Congress a part-time job.

Moreover, the candidate says he isn't worried his association with the now government-controlled firm makes him look like a Washington "insider" -- if anything, he said Wednesday on CBS News radio, he embraces the label.  "There's no question when you serve 20 years in the House and as speaker of the House for four years, you know a fair amount about Washington," Gingrich told CBS News radio correspondent Dan Raviv. "We just tried an amateur for the last three years, and it didn't work very well... The country would be better off with someone determined to change Washington and who knows how to do it."
