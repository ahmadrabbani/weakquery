Approximately 60 percent of the larger publicly traded fast food chains are selling as valuations below the mean EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) multiple of recent private acquisitions in the fast food segment of the foodservice industry. Although the largest fast food chains continue command a higher multiple to EBITDA, the maturity phase of an industry can be indicated by the deterioration in multiples of the weaker players.

These matrix models differ from one another primarily with respect to the major interaction variables by which they are defined (Ailawadi, Farris, & Parry, 1994). Two of the most useful of the matrix models are applied in this study.

Animals and animal products represent, on the average, more costly raw materials than do vegetables and vegetable products. Prepared vegetarian foods have been developed in response to consumer demand. In some instances, this demand is based on philosophical objections to the consumption of animals, or the consumption of both animals and animal products.
