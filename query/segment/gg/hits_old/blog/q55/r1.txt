The Outside Blog Blog           Sunday, June 12, 2011   406 Lance Armstrong and Tyler Hamilton Walk Into a Bar By Outside Online  Tyler Hamilton, the Olympic gold medalist who recently confessed to doping and  accused Lance Armstrong of using performance-enhancing drugs, spent the weekend leading bike rides for  Outside in Aspen, an annual summit we host. Last night, Hamilton went to dinner with friends at Cache Cache [pronounced cash cash], an  Italian French restaurant that also happens to be one of Armstrong’s favorite Aspen hangouts. (Armstrong has a home here, but Hamilton thought the seven-time Tour de France winner was out of town.) During dinner, Hamilton left his table to go to the bathroom. As he walked out of the bathroom, an arm blocked his path. It was Armstrong. The two hadn’t spoken since Hamilton’s  60 Minutes appearance. “He wanted to get into it,” Hamilton told me this morning. “I was like, ‘Let’s step outside and talk away from the crowd, but he wouldn’t. He said, ‘No one cares.’" Then, according to Hamilton, Armstrong began to berate him. (Armstrong’s version of the encounter is a bit more tame: “I said, ‘Hey, what’s up?’” he says. “It was certainly awkward for both of us. It was truly uneventful.”) Hamilton went back to his table and the restaurant’s owner, Jodi Larner, a good friend of Armstrong’s, told Hamilton that he could finish his meal but wasn’t welcome back at the restaurant. I was eating dinner at a restaurant next door from Hamilton along with a couple of other  Outside editors and sales people and a group of Eddie Bauer athletes. As we walked out we passed Hamilton, who was shaken. And, despite the  twittosphere’s  hope for more details , that’s pretty much where the story ends: two guys who don’t feel very kindly toward one another ran into each other at a bar. “I was rattled,” Hamilton told me. “I still am.” Today I rode up Independence Pass with Hamilton and a group of eight riders. Hamilton was gracious and patient with the last rider in our peloton (me), and seemed to be having a good time. He threw snowballs at his friends, cracked jokes and, during one break, played baseball with a stick and a rock. Then he and two other riders posed for a photo. The photographer asked them to say something funny. The men said, "Lance."^ --Abe Streep  @abestreep  ^ This was changed from an earlier post. Originally we reported that Hamilton said "Lance" too. He disputes this.

If a teammate goes out of his way to do an interview with 60 minutes and either lies or tells the truth about events that were meant to be private should consider himself lucky to get away with an arm barring his exit. As for Tyler feeling cathartic after testifying before the grand jury? It still took a year for him to send his medal back. Every "Believe Tyler" dollar was swindled, so screw him if he gets beaten up in an upscale aspen bathroom. The whole process is a waste of time.

Everyone who does not jump on the Tyler/Floyd band wagon is not necessarily being paid by Lance. I wish it weren't true. I'd take his money.

Flag This  Anonymous   06/13/11 11:26:PM  Hamilton is the ultimate tragic figure in sports. No matter that he knowingly cheated and then held onto an Olympic medal for not just a day, or a month but seven years. If you hate Lance, go on and hate him. But hating him for being mean to Tyler, who cares? If a teammate goes out of his way to do an interview with 60 minutes and either lies or tells the truth about events that were meant to be private should consider himself lucky to get away with an arm barring his exit. As for Tyler feeling cathartic after testifying before the grand jury? It still took a year for him to send his medal back. Every "Believe Tyler" dollar was swindled, so screw him if he gets beaten up in an upscale aspen bathroom. The whole process is a waste of time.
