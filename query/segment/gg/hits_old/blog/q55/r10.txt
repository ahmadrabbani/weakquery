For instance,  Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston or Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson. Now you can add the name of  Sheryl Crow who ended her relationship with Lance Armstrong . In an interview with Vanity Fair, she says that, "I definitely still love him and  always will love him...I do think about Lance every day. And I think about his kids every day." Of course, it is all so romantic and beautiful but still begs the question about the  breakups . Couldn't they have  worked it out before calling it quits? I like  Paris Hilton who likes to play musical chairs with her exes rather than  dumping them altogether.     posted by eCreativa Media |  4:11 PM        << Home     Copyright: All rights reserved. eCreativa Media
