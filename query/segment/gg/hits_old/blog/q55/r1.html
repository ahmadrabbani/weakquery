				<h3>Lance Armstrong and Tyler Hamilton Walk Into a Bar</h3>
				<p><a href="/blog?author=Outside+Online" class="byline" rel="author">By Outside Online</a></p>
																
				
																<p>Tyler Hamilton, the Olympic gold medalist who recently confessed to doping and <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/01/sportsline/main20068091.shtml" target="_blank" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/01/sportsline/main20068091.shtml">accused Lance Armstrong</a> of using performance-enhancing drugs, spent the weekend  leading bike rides for <em>Outside</em> in Aspen, an annual summit we host. Last  night, Hamilton went to dinner with friends at Cache Cache [pronounced cash cash], an <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Italian</span> French  restaurant that also happens to be one of Armstrong’s favorite Aspen  hangouts. (Armstrong has a home here, but Hamilton thought the  seven-time Tour de France winner was out of town.) During dinner,  Hamilton left his table to go to the bathroom. As he walked  out of the bathroom, an arm blocked his path. It was Armstrong. The two  hadn’t spoken since Hamilton’s <em>60 Minutes</em> appearance.</p>
<p>“He wanted to get into it,” Hamilton told me this morning. “I was  like, ‘Let’s step outside and talk away from the crowd, but he wouldn’t.  He said, ‘No one cares.’&quot; Then, according to Hamilton, Armstrong began  to berate him.</p>

				

<p>(Armstrong’s version of the encounter is a bit more tame: “I said,  ‘Hey, what’s up?’” he says. “It was certainly awkward for both of us. It  was truly uneventful.”)</p>
<p>Hamilton went back to his table and the  restaurant’s owner, Jodi Larner, a good friend of Armstrong’s,  told Hamilton that he could finish his meal but wasn’t welcome back at  the restaurant. I was eating dinner at a restaurant next door from Hamilton  along with a couple of other <em>Outside</em> editors and sales people and a group  of Eddie Bauer athletes. As we walked out we passed Hamilton, who was  shaken. And, despite  the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/GraysonSchaffer/status/79784954468380672" target="_blank" title="http://twitter.com/#!/GraysonSchaffer/status/79784954468380672">twittosphere’s<strong> </strong>hope for more details</a>, that’s pretty much where the story ends: two  guys who don’t feel very kindly toward one another ran into each other  at a bar. “I was rattled,” Hamilton told me. “I still am.”</p>
<p>Today I rode up Independence Pass with Hamilton and a group of  eight riders. Hamilton was gracious and patient with the last rider in  our peloton (me), and seemed to be having a good time. He threw  snowballs at his friends, cracked jokes and, during one break, played  baseball with a stick and a rock. Then he and two other riders posed for a photo. The photographer asked them to say something funny. The men said, &quot;Lance.&quot;^</p>
<p>--Abe Streep <br /><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/abestreep" target="_blank" title="@abestreep on Twitter">@abestreep</a></p>
<p>^ This was changed from an earlier post. Originally we reported that Hamilton said &quot;Lance&quot; too. He disputes this.<br /><br /><br /></p>

				Boycott the restaurant!
Nothing that Armstrong says can be trusted to be true.  Will the owner of the restaurant, Jodi Larner, apologize to Tyler when Lance is indicted?  I will NEVER go to this restaurant and make sure the owner's behavior is not forgotten.

				Wow, always knew Jodi was a birch but thus is awesome. Cache Cache also used to be a place I loved - no more. Can find plenty of good food and great company anywhere in Aspen.

Tyler, keep your chin up.

				Any positive comment, ya gotta suspect its Lance Co's hired media image machine.. they do a thorough job, all forums.   Anyhoo, I'm sure Lance found out Tyler would be there and made the trip in order to do the confrontation.. that's just Lance's style.  Looking forward to the official indictment.

				Hey Bill, probably 90% of pro riders are dopers, get over it.  they should just legalize doping in pro cycling and let them race.  whoever wants to dope can and if other don't well, good for them.

				Bill (unless you're a Lance Co. media machine attacking the messenger in the same fashion it attacked 60 minutes)

You gotta applaud Outside for hiring Tyler, to break the Omerta, these riders need support after coming clean.  EVERY rider who has tried to come clean is faced with vicious attacks.. if there is zero incentive/support for riders to come clean.. they won't, its easier to stay silent.   You can't stand up to the bullies all by yourself.

				the only way to handle a bully is to smash them in the mouth, in this case with the law. Lance needs to learn his limits and when Novitsky has him taking it where the sun don't shine he'll wish he ordered take out from Cooch Cooch.

				Sorry I must have missed the part where Armstrong actually tested positive for doping or was actually convicted of something. As far as I know Lance has only been accused of doping by self-admitted liars. Oh wait, I forgot it's a conspiracy promulgated by Lance and the anti-doping agency. Right!

				www.factsforlance.info  is the most worthless account of "facts" that I have ever seen. Pretty much up there with the WMD "intel" that got the US into Iraq.

I don't like how people crucify someone who is trying to clear their concience. There were a lot of dirty things happening around that time. The only one's who can be considered clean in my book are those who rose to that level of the sport with all the promise in the world, had a brief mediocre season and disappeared into another career, or returned home to the domestic racing circuit. Danny Pate is a perfect example of getting hammered by the press for not living up to their expectations and why did he lack the motivation and committment to the pro European ranks. It is becoming more and more clear, that he did't want "vitamin supplements". 

Lance is a phenominal athlete and has done great acts of charity, but he is probably pretty far away from being saintly in his own actions.

				Who knows what really happened at the restaurant. What are the chances they'd both be there at the same minute? Not likely without someone setting the whole thing up. Even if Lance doped, he stil is a badass. He beat everyone else who was also doping. This means he's still the best.

				Why do these riders always have to use Lance to generate publicity? If he wanted to come clean, then so be it. Come clean for yourself and leave others out of it whether true or not.  If you drag someone's name in the mud with you, how shaken can you really be when you have to deal with the fallout?

				How can you call Lance the bully when he's the most tested athlete, has never tested positive and is constantly accused by the guilty dopers in an attempt to somehow make what they did seem "OK".  Of course TH was 'shaken' he had a face to face encounter with someone that he falsely accused.  And no, I'm not part of the so called LA media machine.  I'm simply an avid supporter of the Live Strong foundation as someone who lost his mother to cancer.

				For Tyler to be anywhere on this mountain is beyond me. From any location in the entire world to play in Tyler happens to be in the same 1200sf as Lance? Especially where he knows Armstrong likes to hang out is nothing less than antagonistic and yeah right, Tyler thought Lance was out of town.  Regardless of the final disposition of these issues I think it’s undeniable that Lance Armstrong has done more for the world than Tyler could do in 10 lifetimes. So who gets the support? Lance Armstrong. Get off the mountain Tyler or suck it up. There’s a great bike ride out in California I understand at a place called Furnace Creek.

				At a 4th grade party, a well-liked jock classmate cornered and tried to choke me in a hallway while the other kids were elsewhere. It was for being nice to some other kids that had been picked on. I told on him, but he played it down and denied it and the adults shrugged it off as uneventful. For me, however, it was life or death. That bully, suave as he was, came to be very well liked by our teachers, the brown-noser he was.

This Tyler/Lance event reminds me so vividly of this memory. I see it as no different.

Of course, I live in Cancun, and have no interest in going to Aspen at all.  But I still want to get in "boycott" mode just for the heck of it.

				Outside in Aspen is a great event, but it was a mistake to bring in Hamilton. What Hamilton wants to confess to is his business, but to work to implicate others is reprehensible.

				Poor poor Tyler. Boo-hoo! Hey Tyler, you threw it all away. You must be feeling down. Maybe more DHEA to level it out. Maybe find another way out. You know the way out Tyler. Take the short cut and it'll be all better again. You made a name and a career out of taking short cuts so don't stop now and get it over with.

				Shame on Outside for giving money-grubbing, attention-seeking, doping, lying Tyler Hamilton a forum.  My subscription is almost up for renewal and you've made my decision for me.  It's obvious where the editors fall on this issue despite the fact that Armstrong is the most tested athlete in history and has NEVER tested positive.  Apparently, it's impossible for a media outlet to not attempt to tear down the idols it built up.  Shame on you Outside.

				Outside magazine pimps sports gear and poseur fascism, and their event in Aspen is always laaaaaame.  Aspen loves free spirits--what we don't put up with are two-faced narcs.  Hey Tyler:  we don't EVER need sour grapes athletes or narcs in Aspen whether Lance is in town or not, so please go be a douchebag somewhere else.  P.S.  Cache Cache is the best restaurant in town and Jody RULES.

				Lots of Lance defenders here.  Where is the hero himself???  Hiding behind his lawyers as usual.  I want to see him swear on a stack of Bibles that he's never done any illegal drugs, and that when its proven that he has, he agrees to spend the rest of his life in a Chinese prison, making those stupid wristbands he's so famous for.

				Lots of Lance defenders here.  Where is the hero himself???  Hiding behind his lawyers as usual.  I want to see him swear on a stack of Bibles that he's never done any illegal drugs, and that when its proven that he has, he agrees to spend the rest of his life in a Chinese prison, making those stupid wristbands he's so famous for.

				Yeah, why does Outside mag hire a doper to lead rides?

Just like the 60 Minutes piece, both of these accounts can't be true.  I'm sure I'd trust Tyler's account more, yeah, for sure, riiiiiiight.....

				Tyler Hamilton should be bagging groceries at the Safeway.  Shouldn't have anything to do with cycling.

Oh, and do you think Outside hired him AFTER his big exposé?  Probably not.  So they hired a lying doper, not even a just-came-clean doper.

				You Lance-a-luvs are too funny!  He goes into a restaurant, berates a former teammate who's come clean about doping, arranges for him to be banned from the restaurant, and all you can say is 'Go-Lance-Go'?  My farts have more character than your hero.

				All I ask is that all of the people pointing fingers at Tyler and Floyd hold Lance to the same standards if he is found to be lying himself. Maybe Lance can also get on the DoNotEast list at Cache Cache. -btw-this message wasn't paid for by anybody.

				yo Sadsacks. Tyler kept his mouth shut until compelled to testify by the FB-effing-I, whereto you lie you die. This whole crapstory that TH is deliberately lyin (to the Feds?!) to sell a book is LA diverting attention from the smell leakin thru his spandys. Mr. Hincapie sure seems more honorable in not blabbing his own testimony on "60 minutes", but it's the same story (allegedly) and, uber-pal that he is, all the more damning for silence.

				Hamilton is the ultimate tragic figure in sports.  No matter that he knowingly cheated and then held onto an Olympic medal for not just a day, or a month but seven years.  

If you hate Lance, go on and hate him.  But hating him for being mean to Tyler, who cares?  If a teammate goes out of his way to do an interview with 60 minutes and either lies or tells the truth about events that were meant to be private should consider himself lucky to get away with an arm barring his exit.  

As for Tyler feeling cathartic after testifying before the grand jury? It still took a year for him to send his medal back.  Every "Believe Tyler" dollar was swindled, so screw him if he gets beaten up in an upscale aspen bathroom.

The whole process is a waste of time.  What, is Lance going to get convicted and the ASO going to give a jersey to Alex Zulle and six more to Jan Ullrich? 

Come on, get on with your lives.  Everyone who does not jump on the Tyler/Floyd band wagon is not necessarily being paid by Lance.  I wish it weren't true.  I'd take his money.

According to USADA he isn't even the most tested American cyclist.

				You're all missing the point.  There is not a single decent person in this story.  Not Lance, not Tyler, not 60 minutes, not Cache Cache, not Outside Mag.

Everybody has self-serving for their actions.

				Tyler Hamilton is a great guy and great American bike racer. During his era, doping was rampant.  Everyone should take off their veils and move on...

If you think Armstrong never took anything, I have a bridge for you.  His doping does not diminish his accomplishments in my book either.

				Interesting editorial in Sports Illustrated a few weeks ago discussing Lance the likely doper and Lance the passionate fund raiser and how no matter how much of a fraud he might end up being, how those who have benefited from his foundation will be forever indebted to that portion of the man.

Interesting how one person can seemingly live on both sides of the good/bad spectrum.

				Lance's friends (the owner of Cache Cache) in their own words, smoke a lot of pot apparently.  See the "speaker bio" of Cache Cache owner Christopher Lanter a little over halfway down.  <a href="http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=6836">http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=6836</a> 

His Bio ends "Lanter continues to puff on the hootie rat quite frequently."

How soon you all forget that he has been banned from the sport twice, while Lance has has helped countless people.  If you love Lance or not, he is an amazing athlete, so don't let jealousy get in the way of you seeing the truth.

				Tales of Celebrity Glad-handing!
Kevin Costner on Cache-Cache--
“The place we always go to have dinner with the kids is a restaurant called Cache Cache. Jodi [Larner, the owner] is kind of a grande dame, and she has just always taken care of me. The first day I walked in, Jodi had this great smile and said, ‘I was wondering when you were going to walk in here.’ And we’ve been friends ever since.”

				not sure i ever understood why tyler felt the need to "out" lance (for lack of a better phrase).  if he wants to come clean that is fine but what is the point of getting into a he said/she said with armstrong, after they both are out of the sport?

he seems like a pretty mild mannered guy and embarrassed over the whole thing.  doesn't seem like he is looking for headlines or publicity.  what gives?

				Why does Outside Magazine use an admitted liar like tyler Hamilton as a representative for any events? Do you know how much money he bilked his friends and suporters out of with his repeated LIES about never using PEDs?  Your support of this person is disgusting. Knowing you support people who persue agendas of lies, misrepresentation of facts and character assasination makes me glad I dropped my subscription to Outside magazine years ago.

				I'd like to commend Outside Magazine for this article, for working with a cyclist who came clean about doping, and for their fair coverage of the issue for the last 10 years.
Outside has played the Lance doping issue admirably - noting that Lance's feats are impressive, and that he is a great athlete, while simultaneously publishing articles like this one: <a href="http://outsideonline.com/outside/bodywork/200311/200311_drug_test_1.html">http://outsideonline.com/outside/bodywork/200311/200311_drug_test_1.html</a>  
If you've never read "Drug Test," you should.  If you have read it, its probably worth revisiting.  It presents the effects of using steroids from an insiders point of view, without any political motive, malice, or judgment.  
Job well done, Outside.

				I'd feel a lot better about this little story and poor old Tyler Hamilton if I had not been stupid enough to donate $500 to his legal fund years ago.  He had some story about how "he would never blood dope" as he had just watched his beloved dog die. WTF that means I have no idea.

then there was the "missing twin" to explain getting caught both at the olympics AND at the Vuelta. 
Hey Ty - how about replying to my message and I'll tell you where to send the $500 to.  You defrauded me.

				Sound like Lance was looking for a confrontation.  The owner is a potty mouth-attention seeker--who told Lance in advance that Tyler would be there.  Lance will eventually get his day...

				Wouldn't possibly be that Tyler went to Lance's hangout to have a little tete-a-tete and the press to go with it, now would it?  Sell sell sell that little book, Tyler!  A Always B Be C Closing.  Always Be Closing!  They're out there, waiting to give you their money.

				Can anyone believe that Shamilton arrived in Aspen believing that Lance would leave town so as to avoid him ?
Eki still has not received his Gold Medal that was taken by a PROVED/admitted Doper !

				I believe the memory people will have of Lance after his indicment will be of disgust.  He will be remembered as one of the biggest cheaters in sport not just cycling. 

that's my thought
