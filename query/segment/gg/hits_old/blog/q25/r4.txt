After years of 'on the road' development, gas-electric hybrid cars have become a practical choice for consumers. The Toyota Prius, the most successful mass-market hybrid and the best-selling hybrid car, is now in its tenth year on the US market.       A hybrid car features a small fuel-efficient gas engine combined with an electric motor that assists the engine when accelerating. The electric motor is powered by batteries that recharge automatically while you drive.  There are two types of gasoline-electric hybrid cars: the parallel hybrid and the series hybrid. In a parallel hybrid car, a gasoline engine and an electric motor work together to move the car forward, while in a series hybrid the gasoline engine either directly powers an electric motor that powers the vehicle or charges batteries that will power the motor.  Hybrid cars also gain efficiency from:       Smaller and more efficient engines.       Regenerative braking -    the electric motor that drives the hybrid can also slow the car. In this mode, the electric motor acts as a generator and charges the batteries while the car is slowing down.      Periodic engine shut off  -  when a hybrid car is stopped in traffic, the engine is temporarily shut off. It restarts automatically when put back into gear.      Advanced aerodynamics   -   to reduce drag     Low-rolling resistance (LLR) tires      -    narrow, stiffer tires have less drag     Lightweight materials    -  increases the efficiency of hybrid cars.     Hybrid cars cost more than their non-hybrid counterparts, but due to steady gains in technology, the hybrid price premium is coming down. New affordable hybrid sedans, and improved versions of existing hybrids, are expected to at least double hybrid market share in the next five years, from about 2.5 percent in 2010 to 5 percent or higher in the next five years.      These gas-electric hybrid cars are now available in North America. There are other hybrid models which are not on this list due to their less than impressive fuel economy ratings.                    Honda Civic Hybrid Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Toyota Prius Toyota Camry Hybrid Kia Optima Hybrid Honda Insight Hybrid        Ford Fusion Hybrid   Ford Escape Hybrid SUV Lexus 250h Hybrid Lexus 450h Hybrid SUV Toyota Highlander Hybrid SUV Mercury Mariner Hybrid SUV        Mazda Tribute compact SUV   *Saturn Vue Hybrid *Saturn Aura Hybrid     *Chevy Malibu Hybrid     *Nissan Altima Hybrid    *    no longer being built              HYBRID CARS IN THE NEWS    11 Nov 2011 -  Avoiding electrocution: Dedham firefighters learn learn hybrid ropes 8 Nov 2011 -  Hybrid and electric cars losing government support 7 Nov 2011 -  Hybrid cars take a bite out of dealers 4 Nov 2011 -  Hybrid cars drive innovation while meeting consumer demands 3 Nov 2011 -  Hybrid cars the answer for a greener China? 28 Oct 2011 -  New hybrid vehicle battery design announced by AllCell 23 Oct 2011 -  Toyota to sell Chinese-made hybrid cars from 2015 21 Oct 2011 -  Fixing hybrid cars' silent danger 21 Oct 2011 -  Kia's Optima hybrid is the newest in hybrid cars 18 Oct 2011 -  Highways helped by the hybrid car in the fast lane        2012 Honda Civic Hybrid      4 door/5 seat sedan Transmission: CVT automatic or manual Mileage (mpg): 44 city/ 44 hwy Range per fillup: 650 miles 2012 US Base Retail Price: $24,050           Features   Full climate control, Micron air filtration Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) Speed-Sensitive Volume Control (SVC) New USB Audio Interface    Available: Satellite linked navigation w/ voice recognition   Dual-Stage Front and Dual Side Airbags Anti-Theft Immobilizer Available: Bluetooth HandsFreeLink® Tire Pressure Monitoring System Indicator  Eco Assist fuel efficiency indicator     Specifications     110-hp,8-Valve, SOHC, i-VTEC® 4-cylinder engine with Integrated Motor Assist IMA® Drive-By-Wire™ Throttle System; Dual-point sequential ignition system  Electric Power Steering (EPS), variable-assist rack-and-pinion, Continuous Variable Transmission Fuel Capacity/Type Required: 12.3 gallons (46 liters) / Regular Unleaded Brakes: Power-assisted ventilated front disc/rear drum with Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)  Tires: P185/70R14 LLR (low rolling-resistance) on 14" aluminum alloy wheels; All-Season Radials       2012 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid     4 door/5 seat sedan    Transmission: 6-speed automatic Mileage (mpg): 36 city/ 40 hwy     Range per fillup: 680 miles 2012 US Base Retail Price:     $26,545      Features  Single-zone a  utomatic climate control AM/FM/XM/6-CD changer/MP3 audio system with six speakers BlueLink communication system for vehicle protection Eco Level scoring system displays efficiency status 4.2-inch LCD provides hybrid system information  Back-up camera (Premium model)  Touch screen navigation with 7" hi-res screen (option) Panoramic sunroof (Premium model) Bluetooth with Voice Recognition (option) Theft Deterrent System    Specifications        2.4-liter inline-four with 166 horsepower and 154 pound-feet of torque Electric traction motor rated at 40 horsepower,151 pound-feet torque.
