The maker of the Prius, the world’s best-selling hybrid vehicle, will introduce six models including the FCV-R concept car, a midsize sedan that runs on hydrogen. Toyota aims to market the vehicle in 2015. Toyota will also introduce the Aqua compact hybrid, a plug- in version of its Prius hybrid, and the FT-EV III, an all- electric car, at the show. The Toyota City, Japan-based company plans to begin selling the Aqua in late December and the plug-in Prius and the electric vehicle next year. Nissan Motor Co., the maker of the all-electric Leaf car, will display three electric vehicles: the Pivo3 compact, the ESFLOW sports car, and the Townpod compact. The Pivo3 comes with an automatic parking feature that enables it to find a parking space and drive itself to the spot after the driver has left the vehicle. Nissan’s Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn has said the carmaker plans to have four electric models by 2016 and to introduce a plug-in hybrid in 2015. With its French partner Renault SA, the company aims to sell 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles in the next five years. Honda Motor Co., the maker of the Insight hybrid car, will introduce three models, including its first plug-in hybrid, the AC-X sedan, and an electric sports car. The Tokyo Motor Show, which opens to the public on Dec. 2, will feature 15 Japanese auto brands and 25 foreign brands. --Editors: Terje Langeland, Chua Kong Ho To contact the reporters on this story: Anna Mukai in Tokyo at amukai1@bloomberg.net; Yuki Hagiwara in Tokyo at yhagiwara1@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chua Kong Ho at kchua6@bloomberg.net        Business Exchange  E-mail  Print     READER DISCUSSION   Sponsored Links Buy a link now!
