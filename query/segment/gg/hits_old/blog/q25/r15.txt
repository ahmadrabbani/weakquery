 Hybrid Cars and the Environment

                   Home  Topics  Latest Articles          Hybrid Cars and the Environment Hybrid cars are increasingly being touted as the cars of the future. They are supposedly extremely environment-friendly vehicles. The following article examines the relationship between hybrid cars and the environment.     A lot of people around the world are increasingly taking interest in the concept of hybrid cars.  Hybrid cars are being promoted as a feasible solution to the world's fuel problems. At the same time, they are said to be less-damaging to the environment, as compared to cars which run entirely on gasoline. But before I move on to the relationship between hybrid cars and the environment, let me first introduce you to the concept of a hybrid car. What is a Hybrid Car? For those of you who are new to the concept of hybrid cars, here is a short introduction. A hybrid car is quite similar to a gasoline-powered car except that, in this case, there are two or more sources of power (unlike regular  cars which have one common power source - gasoline or diesel). In a hybrid car, one source of power is generally gasoline, whereas the other power sources could be any of the following:  Solar energy  Pressurized or compressed air Electric batteries Fuel cells  Liquid petroleum gas (LPG) Liquified nitrogen Hydrogen Alternative fuels and  biofuels  Wind energy  Manpower  From the above list, it is quite clear that there can be quite a few options when it comes to multiple power sources for a hybrid vehicle. Over the past few years, automobile companies around the world have been testing and trying out various power source combinations in an effort to come up with the best possible power source from the overall perspective of cost, effectivity and efficiency. You can read more on the  Toyota Prius , which is an extremely popular hybrid car in the United States. Let us now have a look at the interrelation between hybrid vehicles and the environment. Hybrid Cars and the Environment Rather than bothering you with the technicalities regarding  how does a hybrid car work , I will instead, focus on how and why they are beneficial to the environment. Are they really a savior to the world's fuel problems? Or are they all hype and no substance? How will they impact the environment and the prevailing pollution levels? Let us try and answer all these questions.  Positive Impact of Hybrid Cars on the Environment How do hybrid cars help the environment? The answer to this question can be understood in its totality by comparing the effects of both, hybrid cars and gasoline-powered cars on the environment.  Cars that run on gasoline or diesel emit tremendous amounts of chemical fumes, pollutants and other harmful byproducts. In comparison, hybrid cars are much gentler on the environment. Fewer and cleaner emissions is a major reason why hybrid cars are popularly known as 'green' cars. Reduced emission ensures lower pollution levels, something which is highly necessary in today's times. Another way in which hybrid cars benefit the environment is that they help in lowering  noise pollution levels. Hybrid car engines go about churning the required amount of horsepower without any excessive roaring. When switched onto electric power mode, these cars are virtually silent when in operation. Imagine thousands of such silent cars on your city roads. That does go a long way in reducing the noise pollution, doesn't it? You can read more on  electric cars . Global warming is one of today's most critical environmental issues and one that desperately needs to be addressed and resolved. In the recent past, the world has slowly but surely started witnessing the adverse effects of global warming. Switching over to hybrid cars on a massive global scale will be a big step and one which will significantly benefit the environment. Reduction in smoke and chemical emissions on a large-scale basis will go a long way in tackling the issue of  global warming . Though not an environmental issue as such, nevertheless, improved fuel efficiency is one of the other significant advantages of owning a hybrid vehicle. When it comes to mileage, hybrid cars outperform regular gasoline-powered cars by approximately 20 to 30 percent. That is quite a significant number in today's  fuel scenario. Shutting off the engine when not required, re-using the energy spent in braking, advanced aerodynamics, better-designed tires, etc. are some of the other advantages that hybrid cars have to offer. Savings! Usage of hybrid cars translates into added savings. As they offer better  fuel economy , you end up spending lesser on gasoline, thereby ensuring a few hundred dollars' worth savings every year. Also, the recent tax benefits being offered by the US government to hybrid car owners does make the decision to switch over to a hybrid vehicle all the more sensible, doesn't it?  Adverse Effects of Hybrid Cars on the Environment Though not many, listed below are a few shortcomings or drawbacks of hybrid vehicles. A few of them are environment-related whereas a few are economy or society-related.  Price-wise, hybrid cars cost a bit more as compared to regular gasoline-powered cars. This tends to become a deterrent for many car buyers. Confusion or lack of awareness is another issue that has so far worked against hybrid cars and  concept cars . People are warming up to the idea of 'green' cars very slowly, and it is not something that has taken the world by storm as yet. Certain aspects of hybrid car batteries are also, in a way, harmful to the environment. Hybrid car batteries are typically nickel metal hydride batteries, which are not exactly environment-friendly. Also, they are bigger in size than regular lead-based batteries and the increased size makes them all the more cumbersome to handle. Finally, 'hybrid cars' is a relatively new technology and one that is still in a transition phase. It will take some time until the technology becomes thoroughly adaptable to the entire world.  This was a brief overview on the topic of hybrid cars and the environment. All said and done, it is quite safe to say that with a few tweaks here and there, this technology is the technology of the future, as far as cars and small-sized vehicles are concerned.
