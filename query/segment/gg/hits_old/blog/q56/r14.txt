However, I would hardly say her 'career has gone swimmingly'. She has only really had success in two tv shows and she has made it known that her first priority is her daughter. In terms of fame and money yes she is hugely successful but I wouldn't really say she has had an excellent career to say she is nearing her fifties. Having said that, I adored her as Lois Lane.  - Kate, Manchester, 26/9/2011 15:57 Click to rate        Rating     12   Report abuse   Thanks alot, now I have that stupid song in my head ......
