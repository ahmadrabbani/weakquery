She also enjoyed a comeback in 2004 as one of the stars of ABC's  Desperate Housewives .  Teri Hatcher Quote " Despite the fact that I have a good-size pair of breasts... in Lois & Clark, I have the opportunity to show the world they're not my only attribute. "   85  Sex Appeal Really, who needs all these other silly categories when you've got a good score in sexiness? And while Teri will not fare as well in Accomplishments & Fame or in the Personality & Talent sections, she certainly brings home the gold in the Sexiness competition.  If an amazing body and gorgeous face were all it took to succeed in this world, then all those accolades and awards wouldn't be wasted on the Sean Penns and  Jodie Foster s of the world, but would find their rightful homes in the arms of the  Carmen Electra s of Hollywood.    80 Success On a relative scale, Teri Hatcher is pretty famous. Very few Americans can say that they've had their own role as the title character on a network TV show, or gotten the chance to teach the rest of the nation about certain products on national commercials.  But on a more accurate scale where the accomplishments of Miss Hatcher are weighed against those of other celebrities, Teri surely doesn't add up. Perhaps the best test of fame is whether a celebrity successfully switches mediums. And Teri, as much as we love her, has only matched the fame of  Lois & Clark on the silver screen once, with her role as a Bond Girl in 1997's  Tomorrow Never Dies .  But she has remained busy, with roles in 1999's  Fever , 2001's blockbuster  Spy Kids , and of course, ABC's smash hit series,  Desperate Housewives . In 2005, she won a Golden Globe as Best Actress in a Television Series (Musical or Comedy).  And, of course, the readers' panel is as much an honest denominator of women as we are fair, and if the amount of downloads one's photos receive is a way to measure success, then call her  Julia Roberts .   Teri Hatcher Biography    Teri Lynn Hatcher was born December 8, 1964, in Sunnyvale, California, outside of San Francisco. She was the only child to father Owen, a nuclear physicist and mother Esther, a computer programmer. With her parents' occupations, one would think that Teri was bound for high school glory in the math club or chess team, but destiny would dictate otherwise.  While it is not mentioned in her official biography, we can only suppose that Teri started to develop her world-class body early in life, giving her the social confidence to become captain of Freemont High School's cheerleader squad, known as the Featherettes. Her moves while cheering on the sidelines must have made an impression, as the graduating 1982 class named Teri the most likely to become a Solid Gold Dancer.   teri hatcher joins the 49ers  After high school, Teri went on to study acting at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco while also pursuing a degree in mathematics and engineering at De Anza College in Cupertino, California. A year later, Teri became a member of the San Francisco 49ers cheerleading squad, known as "The Gold Rush." After the 1984 semester, Teri planned to transfer her credits to the California Polytechnic Institute, but fate stepped in to mix things up once again.  Teri went to Hollywood with a friend to lend support in her friend's bid for an acting job. Teri also went for the part and ended up winning her first paying gig on Aaron Spelling's  Love Boat , as part of the Pacific Princess' resident entertainers, The Mermaids.  From her first role, Teri went on to land some smaller TV roles and had her first big film part as an egomaniac actress in the 1989 satire,  The Big Picture . She went on to some comic supporting roles in films such as  Tango & Cash with  Sylvester Stallone ,  Soap Dish with Whoopi Goldberg, and  Straight Talk with  Dolly Parton . In 1988, Teri married personal trainer Markus Leithold, but the marriage only lasted 10 months.   teri hatcher is lois lane  In 1993, Teri starred in one of her biggest projects to date, as Lois in every true Superman fanatic's worst nightmare,  Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman . The show made her a household name and brought her into America's living rooms every week.  In 1994, Teri married actor Jon Tenney (who appeared in  You Can Count On Me ) and the couple had their first child, a daughter named Emerson Rose, on November 10, 1997.   teri in tomorrow never dies   After a four-year run with  Lois & Clark , Teri remained a force in Hollywood with high-profile roles in the 007 extravaganza  Tomorrow Never Dies and  2 Days In The Valley (in which she has a physical fight with  Charlize Theron ), but she is still well-known for her role as Jerry's girlfriend on  Seinfeld , who tells Jerry that her breasts are "real, and they're spectacular."   teri stars in desperate housewives   Taking some time off to take on a whole new role as mom, Teri was seen in the 2001 film,  Spy Kids . After enjoying some time as a proud spokesperson for Radio Shack and appearing in made-for-TV movies like 2001's  Jane Doe and  Say Uncle , and 2003's  Momentum , Teri was cast as single mom Susan Mayer in ABC's hit series,  Desperate Housewives . Not only did the show enjoy a strong debut in the ratings, but Teri was awarded the Best Actress in a Television Series (Musical or Comedy) Golden Globe in 2005.  On a personal note, Teri is a self-proclaimed animal lover who spends time with her family north of Los Angeles.
