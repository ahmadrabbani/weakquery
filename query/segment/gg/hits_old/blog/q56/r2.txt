Scroll down for the close-ups of her face as she raises and furrows her mobile brow for the camera. In an album titled, 'Oy with Botox' Hatcher wrote in part: Out of the bath getting ready for bed. Thought about all those damn critics of my face. Love it or hate it, my face that is, no surgery, no implants, no matter what "they" say. Decided I'd shoot myself in to reveal some truths about "beauty" and hope it makes you all easier on yourself. Did I every toy with fillers or Botox over the years? yes. Tell me does this look Botoxed to you? Yes I am alone in my bathroom naked in a towel on behalf of women everywhere trying to make a point. Women YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL I can be mad, or confused or sad and tired. Julia Roberts had that same vein in her forehead in Eat Pray Love. Proud of Julia for being a real woman on a real journey. 45 year old me. Just me wanting to teach that all those glam versus trash pictures of celebs are about LIGHTING. It's not makeup it's not suregery [sic] or botox its LIGHT.  Then she posted a photo of herself in lingerie from the set of the show.  Get HuffPost Entertainment On  Twitter and  Facebook !

From my observatio ­n and experience post menopausal women - especially those without makeup - are sexually repulsive to most men. This doesn't mean that such women are bad people, it simply means they are not attractive ­. Evolution hardwired the male brain for strong attraction for feminine youth and beauty as such characteri ­stics correlate highly with fertility, and this is why most men are naturally attracted to post-pubes ­cent young women ages 14 - 25. Makeup and modern cosmetics allow older women to simulate the traits of younger women and extend this age range to about 35 - but not much past that. Stories like these are simply feminist propaganda to "change beauty standards" to force men to like older, uglier and more masculiniz ­ed women, and shame us for liking young, pretty feminine women. Of course Teri and women like her expect to attract men of very high evolutiona ­ry value (alpha males) - but men are expected to lower our standards and pretend to like what is naturally repulsive to us. Women don't pretend to like anything but alpha males with status, height, toughness, coolness, success, money, etc - with their countless lists, rules, prime time TV shows, romance novels, chick flicks obsessing on such idealized men. It's a double standard and I have the right to voice this opinion, although the feminist/l ­iberal controlled would rather such un-PC truths be suppressed ­.  redviper787: I remember how gorgeous she was in the Superman TV http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/redviper787/teri-hatcher-naked-makeup_n_678912_57295062.html  History   |   Permalink   |  Share it            HUFFPOST SUPER USER ValdaDeDieu Author: NOCTURNE, BLOODPACT, DEATH MISSION TRILOGY  607 Fans           04:07 PM on 8/15/2010  You're still hot.
