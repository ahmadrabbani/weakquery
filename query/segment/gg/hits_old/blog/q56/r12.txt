Tweet              "Smallville" has made a habit out of paying tribute to the franchise that gave it life, particularly when it comes to the guest star department. It continues this season, the show's final season, with Teri Hatcher. Back in the second season, the Superman-in-training series needed an enigmatic billionaire character to be the rosetta stone in pushing Clark (Tom Welling) towards his Kryptonian heritage ... and they found him in the form of the late Christopher Reeve. The actor, who played Superman in the 1970s and 1980s big-screen outings, made several appearances in the show whenever Clark needed a nudge in the right direction, and also had some verbal dueling with the Luthors. From then on, the show has also featured appearances by Margot Kidder (who played Lois Lane alongside Reeve in the movies) as well as Dean Cain, the small screen face for the Man-of-Steel in "Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman." Well, now it is "Smallville's" very own Lois Lane (Erica Durance) who is in need of a little nudge toward her destiny and producers have sealed a deal to ensure that it is another icon of the franchise to deliver it. Hatcher, who played Lois in "Lois and Clark" will make an appearance in the 10th season of the series as Lois Lane's mother, Ella.  The episode, entitled "Abandoned," will feature Lois finding some old videotapes of her mother and will provide a chance for some more Lois-centric storytelling. This is the first time a member of the Lane family has been seen on the series since Durance made her debut on the show during the fourth season. Back then, Gen. Sam Lane and her sister Lucy were introduced along with the future super-sleuth reporter.  "Smallville" returns to The CW on Sept. 24 at 8 p.m. ET.
