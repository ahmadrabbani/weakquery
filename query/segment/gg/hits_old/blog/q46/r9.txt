I think they like me but we will see what happens." Unfortunately the Suns didn't allow media access so that was basically the lone report we have to work on. Wednesday is the highly anticipated match-up between Fredette and UConn's Kemba Walker as both audition for the Utah Jazz. As for today's "Follow Jimmer" webisodes see Jimmer sign autographs and put together the plans for his basketball camp with BYU teammate Jackson Emery. Emery also admitted to stealing a Jimmer practice jersey and his socks from BYU. Drama! Also see Jimmer practice (again) and what some others have to say about him.
