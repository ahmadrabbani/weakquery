As detailed in  this Bloomberg piece , headlined "Bonds’s Obstruction Conviction in Steroids Probe Upheld by Federal Judge," late yesterday "U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco [denied Barry Bonds'] request for an acquittal and refus[ed] to grant a new trial." Here is more: Illston rejected Bonds’s argument that there was no crime in his 146-word answer to a grand jury about whether his trainer Greg Anderson ever gave him anything that required an injection with a syringe. His attorney, Dennis Riordan, said at an Aug. 25 hearing before Illston that the former San Francisco Giants outfielder took about 75 seconds to respond to prosecutors’ direct question and eventually answered “no.” “Defendant repeatedly provided nonresponsive answers to questions about whether Anderson had ever provided him with injectables, resulting in the prosecuting attorneys asking clarifying question after clarifying question, and even once resulting in one prosecutor interrupting another who was about to move on to a new topic in order to clarify defendant’s mixed responses,” Illston wrote in her ruling. “An evasive answer about an issue material to the grand jury is not necessarily rendered immaterial by the later provision of a direct answer, even if that direct answer is true.” Bonds, 47, was convicted in April by a federal jury in San Francisco of obstructing a U.S. probe of steroid use by professional athletes. Jurors were unable to agree on whether Bonds lied when he told a grand jury in 2003 that he didn’t knowingly take steroids, didn’t take human growth hormone and didn’t receive injections by Anderson. A mistrial was declared on those counts.  The full 20-page ruling denying the motions for acquittal and a new trial in  US v. Bonds is available at  this link .  And, as the title of this post hints, I am not sure if this ruling means that sentencing is now to be the next stage of the long-running Bonds legal saga.

Posted by: rodsmith | Aug 28, 2011 12:12:19 AM  Rod, Bonds' conviction has nothing to do with testimony before Congress. There was a grand jury investigation long before the more famous congressional hearings. Bonds' conviction stems from those proceedings. I'm not even sure that Bonds appeared at the congressional hearings and he may have taken the 5th if he did. Roger Clemens troubles on the other hand do stem from the congressional hearings. Posted by: Soronel Haetir | Aug 28, 2011 10:29:43 AM  hmm "Bonds, 47, was convicted in April by a federal jury in San Francisco of obstructing a U.S. probe of steroid use by professional athletes." considering this so called probe was done when what they were doing was not regulated and in fact legal...it's STILL a JOKE conviction!
