By Marc Topkin, Times Staff Writer Published February 25, 2008 ADVERTISEMENT          ST. PETERSBURG - There has been no formal offer, actual wooing or even public displays of affection. But the Rays seem to have at least an eye on Barry Bonds, and team officials have recently talked internally about the all-time home run king who has been at the center of the steroids controversy.  The Rays have weighed the merits of other remaining free agents, such as Mike Piazza and Kenny Lofton, and may not have decided whether to proceed on any of them. In Bonds' case, there would be a lot to think about in balancing what good he could do at the plate and the gate vs. the disruption he could cause in the clubhouse. (Unlike some teams, they also haven't said publicly they wouldn't consider Bonds, either.)  "Our policy is to not comment on any players outside the organization except to say generally that we're committed to improving our roster for 2008 and beyond," executive vice president Andrew Friedman said.  Bonds, 43, is seeking a chance to play and, adding to the potential plot, his agent, Jeff Borris, is in Tampa this week. But he wouldn't say Sunday night if, or how much, the Rays were interested.  "I talk to Tampa Bay all the time for a variety of reasons," Borris said.  About Bonds?  "I won't comment on that one way or another. ... There's only so much I can say."  Will you meet with them while you're in the area? "I can't say."  More intrigue? Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg is due in town this week.  Bonds passed Hank Aaron last year to establish a homer record of 762 and is 65 hits shy of 3,000.  Borris said there are "no legal impediments" that would prevent Bonds from playing this season, though he was indicted and pleaded not guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice charges, which allege that he lied when he told a federal grand jury he never knowingly used performance-enhancing drugs. He is asking a judge to dismiss the case.

Anyway i just got back from the Rays vs Yankees, two words DAVID PRICE.     by Zjax  03/05/08 03:29 AM   SICK!!! I go to 10-15 games a year right now but if they bring in Barry Im getting some season tickets. Having Crawford, Pena, Longoria (I hope), Baldelli, Iwamura, Floyd, Bartlett, and a few other role players in the with BARRY, are you kidding me?!     by melissa  03/03/08 08:20 PM   I think the Devil Rays should sign Mike Piazza because if they donot thennobody else will sign him. All fans want him to come to Shea and play for the Mets and shut down Shea . I would love to see him retire as Met. Thanks for all the memories Mike     by Mike  02/29/08 12:04 PM   Having followed the Giants for years, I think Barry Bonds would prove only a plus for the Rays. There is a reason he was beloved in the other Bay area. With 200-300 likely MLB steroid users, why should Bonds be the only one banished from baseball?     by Matt  02/26/08 09:43 PM   Barry Bonds wouldbegreat for any American league team. 30 to 40 hrs, 100 rbis, 100 walks are a distinct possibility as DH. Not to mention what effect he has the line up. His presence allows others around him to see great pitches to hit. ie J. Kent     by Rodger  02/26/08 02:32 PM   Barry bonds is to old to sign to anykind of descent contract. He deserves league minimum with bonus's for numbers reached. give him 10 million the day he hits 50 HR in any season, if not at least he is playing the game he loves and not forced out.     by MR x  02/26/08 12:08 PM   In the hearts of white people most black people are guilty,before innocent as in the case of Barry Bonds.Name a player on Tampa Bay right now,than can fill more seats than Barry.Love or hate Barry he brings excitement to the game,so as a Tampa fan i     by ya motha  02/26/08 09:47 AM   bonds will hit 20 hrs and about 80 rbi it makes sense     by DEBBI  02/25/08 10:20 PM   I LIVE IN BOSTON AND WANT TO SEE BONDS 18 TIMES A YEAR IN FENWAY PARK , I WISH WE WOULD GET HIM IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE, MAN GO FOR IT,LOFTON IS ANOTHER ONE WHOS AVAILABLE, THOES TWO WILL MOVE YOUR TEAM UP FOUR PLACES OR MORE PLEASE IT WILL ONLY HELP.     by Roland  02/25/08 10:07 PM   So this is where we have come to. A team that has never made past .500 and wants the tax payers to build a stadium that will be miserable to get to and sit in, Now wants to talk to a has been who's success came from cheating. Just Go Away!!!     by LAT  02/25/08 08:40 PM   Greatest player ever! Sign him and your Rays instantly improve and may even begin to think about challenging the Yankees and the Red Sox. SIGN HIM!!     by George W  02/25/08 07:10 PM   Barry Bonds is a very nice man. More people should be like him. Many kid rightfully look up to him     by David  02/25/08 07:06 PM   If it improves the team and livens up that mausoleum (aka God's waiting room) the Rays play in has to help. Sign him. Let the holier than thous go root for the 50 win teams elsewehere     by Gary  02/25/08 06:21 PM   Please, please please dont inject this prima donna drug pumped jerk into the Rays young clubhouse..MASSIVE ERROR ...it would nauseat me!!!!!!!!!!     by Paul  02/25/08 06:02 PM   It's kind of ironic how yesterdays Rays article was all about getting rid of the clubhouse "cancer" and Maddon running a "one big happy family" type of ball club. If signing Bonds isn't a complete 180 on that theory then I don't know what is.     by Ben  02/25/08 04:06 PM   I will forever ditch the Rays if they sign Bonds. He is a cancer and we don't need to ruin the most promising team we ever had.     by Someone Who Speaks Sense  02/25/08 03:37 PM   Why would someone oppose this? Because he used steroids before? Drug addict? Way to desensitize everyone to real addicts... .480 OBP. The steroird era is over. These guys are clean. If he was a cheater, he wouldn't be eligible to be signed...     by Jim  02/25/08 03:22 PM   Bonds was a jerk, is a jerk, and always will be a jerk. Not worthy of the attention given him, and is damaging to the young people watching him.     by John  02/25/08 01:59 PM   Not necessary. Jonny Gomes will hit 40 HR this year.     by George  02/25/08 01:42 PM   Just make sure he stays away from the establishments on Dale Mabry Blvd in Tampa !     by kathy  02/25/08 01:41 PM   I say let Bonds play. His roid days are over and the rays need a player with his talent. People will come to watch him play, love him or hate him.     by Eric.  02/25/08 01:30 PM   Didn't the Rays just get rid of the Devil?     by Deez  02/25/08 01:14 PM   Bonds is a cheater but it can benefit us if not too expensive. its about money, this is a business, not a convent.     by John  02/25/08 01:13 PM   AWESOME!!!!! They need to do this. He will put this team on the map.     by Sean  02/25/08 12:50 PM   You people are ridiculous. How would they be going back to the old Rays? They would be spending alot of money to bring in one the great hitters in mlb history. And I don't concider roiders drug addicts, because you can't become addicted to roids.     by Chris  02/25/08 12:48 PM   Sign him, makes absolute sense. With all the cheating players the Red Sox and Yankees employee with 39x the payroll why shouldn't the Rays at least attempt to bring in someone that can show the team what it takes to win in the AL East?     by Chris  02/25/08 12:34 PM   If Bonds gets us over the top, then I don't care what he does. It's his body, not mine. Too many people are quick to pass judgement. So what if he cheated, he's not now. Let him smack a few out of the hospital, I mean Trop.     by Fan  02/25/08 12:18 PM   Those that say they would not remain a fan if they sign Barry, were not true fans to begin with. I think a team should sign whoever they think is the best fit for the money and the team. Players come and go so I support a team, not a player. Go Rays!     by T  02/25/08 12:09 PM   After 10 years the Rays have been nothing but a losing franchise. They are just now starting to show somewhat of a desire to win. Signing Bonds would be a bad idea because of the negative attention and cost that could better be spent on younger guys.     by roger clemens  02/25/08 11:48 AM   if they do sign barry i feel the drays gotta give me a shot and bring back my party buddy jose canseco maybe we can pick up raffy palmeiro and sammy sosa.. is mark mcgwire wanting to come out of retirement too? ill get working on my blackberrry now!     by David  02/25/08 11:37 AM   How can someone who hasnt been to a game in years even qualify not going as a "boycott" if you dont go anyway, why would the rays care?     by Fred  02/25/08 11:36 AM   If he's cheap enough and if Carl get's a bigger Barcalounger, then I say, "Sign'em!!!!!!!"     by Harold  02/25/08 11:18 AM   I would be quite a coup to get a player of Bonds of Piazza's level here. I say go for it!!!     by John  02/25/08 11:00 AM   I am 2nd to noone is thinking Barry Bonds is an over ego's cheat!That said the guy can still hit and the Rays need to FINALLY show to the area they committed to winning.     by Sim  02/25/08 10:44 AM   You folks are crazy. Inserting Bonds in the middle of this lineup makes us an instant contender. Bonds is no different then Clemens, Tejada, Sosa, McGwire, etc. Newsflash -- they all cheat!! Bring him in and you folks will cheer.        Subscribe to the Times     Click here for daily delivery of the St. Petersburg Times.   Email Newsletters Be the first to know.
