NBC Bay Area just posted a 150-plus-word story saying that there is a  verdict in the Barry Bonds trial  . What does the jury—a "group of four men and eight woman" [sic]—have to say? Nothing yet!    UPDATE: Now various  Twitter posts  say there is no verdict after all. OK,  that  is the very lowest point in the news cycle.     UPDATE TO UPDATE: Twitter is now  unable to decide  whether the jury has reached a partial verdict or whether it "may have reached" a partial verdict.     UPDATE TO UPDATE OF UPDATE: Guilty of one count of obstruction of justice. Hung on the remaining counts.
