 A Large Regular

I agree that if you asked pretty much anyone who ever got their hand caught in the cookie jar - they most likely would say it wasn't worth it. However, I can't help but remember that Barry Bonds made $135 million AFTER he started juicing. Was that $135 million worth it?  Consider that Barry Bonds was picked with the 6th pick of the  first round of the 1985 MLB Draft . The following players went before him BJ Surhoff ($20 million in earnings after 1998), Will Clark ($10.9 million but out of baseball after 2000), Canton Mass's Bobby Witt ($2.1 million and out of baseball after 2001), Barry Larkin ($38.5 million) and Kurt Brown a catcher drafted by the White Sox who never played a game in the big leagues. That means that if you accept that Barry Bonds started juicing after 1998 then he made almost double the money of all the guys drafted ahead of him combined from that point forward. Combined.  Was that worth it becomes a different question altogether. The question then becomes more akin to "Would you spend a year in jail for millions of dollars?" How would you answer that question?
