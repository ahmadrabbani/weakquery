In 2001, he hit more home-runs in a single season than any baseball player in history. Now he also claims the title for more home-runs in a career, by breaking Hank Aaron's record. There can be no doubt, this is a remarkable achievement. Other than Barry Bonds, only the legendary  Babe Ruth could claim both of these records. Previously, Roger Maris held only the single season mark and Hank Aaron was the career leader but never came close to 60 home-runs in a single year. Baseball fans should celebrate this remarkable achievement by Barry Bonds.  However, many sports fans view the new record as tainted. Fans in general believe that Barry Bonds has used steroids. These accusations at this time are unsubstantiated. He has not admitted steroid use and testing has failed to prove he has used steroids. Yet, there are several reasons fans doubt his innocence. He is a product of the times and heavy steroid use does exist in our world today. We can look to Jason Giambi, Rafael Palmeiro and Jose Canseco for evidence. The use of steroids is dangerous and competitively unfair to other players. As a nation, we can not condone performance enhancing drugs. It sends a despicable message to our young people. In general, Americans favor fairness in sports. We can not tolerate cheaters, as our sports heroes. We have to find positive examples for our youth. Our sports heroes must set examples for our youth to follow. Former players like Ty Cobb and Pete Rose who exhibited an unsportsmanlike attitude have a less than treasured spot in the heart of many baseball fans today. But, the question remains, is Barry Bonds guilty of steroid use?    1  2   Next Page    Published by  James Withers, Sr.  U.S. Navy 1965-1992 Married, two grown children    View profile    The Continuing Non-story of Barry Bonds Still Topping Albert Pujols in the Headlines   An analysis of the (possibly) historic 2006 season of Albert Pujols, the never ending saga of Barry Bonds and the media's coverage of both.

Are you the Gary Lester who went to Diamond Hill Jarvis and was a CPO at the Austin Naval Reserve Center? If so, good to hear from you again.    Gary Lester 4/5/2011  No.  It's just our government run amok.  I don't care what your using. Hitting home runs is hard work.    Adolfo Rodriguez Jr 11/25/2007  I believe that Barry Bonds indictment is NOT racially motivated. I have been reading and listening to various commentaries on this subject and all the African American consensus is that it was racially motivated. Let's look at the facts. Was Barry Bonds singled out...YES. Was Barry Bonds indicted so that he can be made an example of...YES. But, he was indicted because he broke the most important and hallowed record in american sport! It was not racially motivated, but it was motivated because of his arrogance and because he is now at the top of the heap! And the reason that McGuire and Palmeiro and Giambi were not indicted is because they are not at the top of the heap! As a matter of fact they were not even close to the record. If you want to cry racism, that should have been done when the legitimate Home Run King, Henry Aaron, broke the record. Mr. Arron endured true racism (and death threats) on his way to breaking a white man's record (Babe Ruth). If you ask me, the real tragedy is    Displaying Comments     To comment, please  sign in to your Yahoo! account, or  sign up for a new account.             Associated Content from Yahoo!
