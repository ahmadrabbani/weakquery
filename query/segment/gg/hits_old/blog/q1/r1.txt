Photograph by:  Mark Van Manen, PNG Files, Vancouver Sun    It is October. Somehow, they have to get to June. The trail between Game 1 and Game 100-and-some looks a million miles long from here, and it's guaranteed to pass - because every hockey season does - through a minefield of injuries, mental fatigue, slumps and crises. And only if enough elements break right, and right to the end, do the Vancouver Canucks get to do what the Pittsburgh Penguins did two seasons ago: rebound from a loss in the Stanley Cup Final to get there again - and win. Ask Ray Shero what the Penguins had to battle, mentally and physically, to return to the final and beat Detroit in 2009, and the Pittsburgh GM begins with this: "Disappointment," he said Thursday, as the Pens - sans Sidney Crosby - and Canucks prepared to open their seasons at Rogers Arena, where the 2010-11 campaign seems to have ended just five minutes ago. "Not knowing if we'd ever get back there again. I mean, all that work . the realization that we got to Game 6 of the finals and we lost, you could feel that coming back to training camp. And thank God we won the second time, because I can't imagine what it would have been like - what it must have been like for the Buffalo Bills, getting [to the Super Bowl] four times in a row and losing." Comparisons, in this case, are inexact. The 2009 Penguins had a nucleus of young, resilient stars - Crosby, Evgeny Malkin, Jordan Staal, MarcAndre Fleury - just hitting their stride. Their window for winning the Cup was considerably larger than that of the Canucks, who have just one reasonably young star, Ryan Kesler, and the rest of their nucleus well on in years. "In our situation, too, we lost some key role players from the year before - Ryan Malone on a big free-agent contract with Tampa, a couple of others, so we lost a little bit of our identity in terms of our grit," Shero said. "Also, we had two injuries to pretty good defencemen right off the bat - lost Sergei Gonchar in the first pre-season game, he was gone for 55 games, and then we lost Ryan Whitney for 35." The 2008-09 Pens were in 10th place, outside the playoffs, in February. "It was a combination of a little of the roster, a little of the injuries, and a little of the disappointment and trying to get the feeling back," Shero said. "We had to make a coaching change." Out went Michel Therrien, in came Dan Bylsma from the farm team in Wilkes-Barre. "We just needed to get things going in the right direction, a little more positive attitude," said Shero. "It was a breath of fresh air when Bylsma came in." What the Penguins faced - what the Canucks face, too - is nothing they haven't anticipated. "I think the two biggest things are, one, you definitely don't sneak up on anybody," said Pittsburgh defenceman Brooks Orpik. "I mean, they've been good for a long time, so maybe it's not that much different - but no matter what game you're playing out of 82, the other team probably has that marked off on their schedule. Everyone's gunning for you. "But also, you hear so much from media and fans about, 'Jeez, is there going to be a hangover, and fatigue?' Guys take care of themselves so well now, I really don't think that [physical] part of it's a big deal, but it's probably more of a mental drain. That's why you have to kind of keep your focus within the room . because if people tell you you're supposed to be tired, you're going to feel tired, and sometimes you can use that as a crutch if things don't go your way."  Shero and Orpik and Pens winger Pascal Dupuis all agreed on one other essential of a successful Stanley Cup run: luck. The Canucks, last spring, may have used up all theirs in the first round against Chicago. By the time they faced Boston in the final, they were trying to do it with smoke and mirrors. "When you take an actual hard, analytical look at what happened in five games last year - the last five games of the Stanley Cup Final - it's pretty clear," Canucks GM Mike Gillis said Thursday. "The strength of our team throughout the season was our ability to adapt to adversity because we had the personnel to do it. When we got to the final, we couldn't come at them with wave after wave like we had in the season, because Kesler was injured, Samuelsson was injured, Manny [Malhotra] was at basically 40 per cent, Raymond got hurt, Rome got suspended, Hamhuis got hurt, Higgins had a broken foot, Edler had broken fingers ... you go down the list, and we couldn't push back in the way we were accustomed to, by putting the puck in their net. "And that's the reality. People want to interpret that as an excuse, but it's fact. I was in the medical room. I know what was going on." Injuries are the wild card in any plan, and Gillis and the Canucks brain trust definitely had a plan for this pre-season, trying to engineer the proper state of readiness to begin the marathon again. That's why they held so many of the veterans out of all but a couple of exhibition games. "We thought long and hard about it. We talked to other people, we looked at other sports, Alain talked to coaches in other sports, to other NHL coaches," Gillis said. The suggestion, though, that the Canucks might be willing to sacrifice a little regular-season glitz to be in better shape come April and beyond is not it at all, said the GM. "I think losing the year before can have a really positive effect on your team. Most of our players had never been in that situation before," he said. "I think it allows them the comfort of knowing that things aren't determined by one game or one period or one shift, they're determined by consistency, and belief, and doing things the right way in every game you play. "You need to get lucky, too, though. You need to have everything go your way to get there, and hopefully if you get another opportunity, you've learned from your experience." Gillis is all for learning from history, but there's one part of the Penguins' blueprint he's not sure he needs to adopt. "You're not planning to fire Alain Vigneault in February?" a writer asked. "Not now, I'm not," Gillis said, smiling. But he half-jokingly left the thought unfinished. Even February is a long way away. ccole@vancouversun.com Twitter.com/rcamcole NEXT GAME Monday vs. Columbus Blue Jackets 4 p.m. at Nationwide Arena snet-p/team 1040 © Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun         E-mail this Article    Print this Article   Share this Article                         Location refreshed    Story Tools      E-mail this Article    Print this Article       Font:  *    *    *    *    *      Image:  *    *    *    *                              The Vancouver Canucks would much rather emulate the Pittsburgh Penguins of 2009 than the NFL Buffalo Bills of the early 1990s.
