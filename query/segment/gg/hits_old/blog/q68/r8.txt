Gehry will converse with Julie Iovine, executive editor of  The Architect’s Newspaper , and Yael Reisner, author of  Architecture and Beauty: Conversations with Architects about a Troubled Relationship , which is based on 16 interviews Reisner conducted with some of the world's most creative designers, including Gehry, on their beliefs, experiences, and position on aesthetics. The 16 designers discuss their formative experiences, creative processes and motivations, and whether they think that beauty is integral or nonessential to architecture. The event is free and open to the public. More info:  pratt.edu   Comments  Be the first to comment.
