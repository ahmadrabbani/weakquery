 Chicago Millennium Park

 Chicago Traveler      Connect              Chicago Millennium Park     Chicagotraveler Information  Map    Chicago Millennium Park Aerial View of Millennium Park  First planned in 1997 as a way to create new parkland in  Grant Park and transform unsightly railroad tracks and parking lots,  Millennium Park has evolved into the most significant millennium project in the world. And the reviews are already in. "Millennium Park," says one prominent civic leader, "will be a worthy creation for all time. It will define Chicago to the entire world as America's greatest city." Located in downtown Chicago on Michigan Avenue between Randolph and Monroe Streets, the 24.5-acre park is an unprecedented center for world-class art, music, architecture and landscape design, where you can experience everything from interactive public art and ice skating to al fresco dining and free classical music presentations by the Grant Park Orchestra and Chorus. Among the park's prominent features is the dazzling Jay Pritzker Pavilion, the most sophisticated outdoor concert venue of its kind in the United States, designed by Frank Gehry, one of the world's greatest living architects.

Jay Pritzker Pavilion has 4,000 fixed seats and capacity for an additional 7,000 people on the lawn    BP Bridge  The BP Bridge, a sinuous pedestrian bridge designed by Frank Gehry, links Millennium Park with the eastern portion of Grant Park and provides incomparable views of the city's skyline, Grant Park and Lake Michigan. The only Gehry-designed bridge in the world, the 925-foot long BP Bridge is clad in stainless steel panels and has a gentle slope and hardwood deck. It will also provide an acoustic barrier between the audience and the traffic noise on Columbus Drive. More info...    Chase Promenade  The Chase Promenade crosses the park and provides an area for year-round free cultural programming, including ethnic festivals, fairs, exhibitions, and family events. Centrally located in Millennium Park, this three-block long walkway creates a beautiful outdoor area between Randolph and Monroe Streets, welcoming visitors to experience a wide variety of activities in the park.  More info...    Crown Fountain  Designed by Spanish sculptor Jaume Plensa, the Crown Fountain features two 50-foot high glass block towers at each end of a shallow reflecting pool. The towers are activated with changing video images and lights, and water cascades from the top of each. Anchoring the southwest corner of Millennium Park at Michigan Avenue and Monroe Streets, the Crown Fountain is a major addition to the city's world-renowned public art collection. Inspired by the people of Chicago whose faces appear on the glass towers' changing video images, this site-specific work creates both a unique meeting point and a dynamic space for silent reflection. Utilizing water, light, and glass, Plensa has created a bold statement that is sure to stimulate passers-by and invite them to enter and experience Millennium Park.  More info...    Exelon Pavilions Harris Theater  Opening in the Fall, the Exelon Pavilions are located on Randolph Street to the east and west of the Joan W. and Irving B. Harris Theater for Music and Dance and on Monroe Street to the east and west of the Lurie Garden. The northeast Exelon Pavilion on Randolph Street provides access to parking below and the northwest Pavilion also serves as a welcome center providing orientation to Millennium Park and a venue for special exhibitions on energy, parks and other themes. Elevator access to parking below from the street and terrace levels is located in both pavilions.  More info...    Harris Theater  The state-of-the-art Joan W. and Irving B. Harris Theater for Music and Dance opened in November 2003 and has become the city's prime indoor performance space for mid-sized arts organizations, lauded for its excellent sightlines and acoustics. The theater seats 1,525 and offers programs ranging from classical ballet and contemporary dance to classical, chamber, opera and folk music.  More info...    Kapoor Sculpture on SBC Plaza (Cloud Gate) video of "The Bean"  A major feature of Millennium Park is the 110-ton elliptical sculpture designed by the celebrated British artist Anish Kapoor, one of the most prolific and respected sculptors in the world. "Cloud Gate," the monumental sculpture located on SBC Plaza was named by the artist on June 29 when the final panel of the elliptical sculpture was installed. The sculpture is forged of a seamless series of highly-polished stainless steel "plates" that create an elliptically-arched, highly reflective work with Chicago's skyline and Millennium Park itself as a dramatic backdrop. Visitors will be able to fully experience the majestic nature of the work by literally walking through and around, as it was designed for public interaction. Inspired by liquid mercury, the sculpture is among the largest in the world, measuring 66-feet long by 33-feet high.  More info...    Lurie Garden  Designed by the team of Kathryn Gustafson, Piet Oudolf and Robert Israel, Millennium Park's Lurie Garden is a unique combination of spatial structure, plantings and lighting design. The Garden encompasses distinctive spaces—both large and intimate—defined by sculpted hedgerows and pedestrian pathways. The 15-foot high "shoulder" hedge encloses the Garden on two sides and a hardwood walkway follows a water feature that cuts diagonally through the Garden, separating it into the "light plate" with 240 varieties of perennial plants and the "dark plate," which is shaded by flowering cherry trees. The Lurie Garden offers a rich and varied sensory experience throughout the seasons, day and night.
