Stewart           It is sad and unfortunate that any "Christian" or Christian organization would endorse such an evil invention as Harry Potter.  The Bible clearly condemns any type of involvement with the wicked works of witchcraft.  I was saddened to learn from one of my faithful web visitors that  Christianity Today magazine was endorsing Harry Potter.  I looked into the matter myself and it was confirmed.  Below is one such article on their website.  If you'll simply perform a site search on Christianity Today's website under "Harry Potter," you'll be sickened as any God-fearing Christian should be.  Harry Potter is evil and we should  not endorse such wickedness.    The partial article below was taken from Christianity Today's library at the following link:     http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2000/january10/29.37.html    Why We Like Harry Potter  The series is a 'Book of Virtues' with a preadolescent funny bone.  A Christianity Today editorial | It's Christmas present shopping time. Time for your 10-year-old to make his list—and for you to check it twice. But are the Harry Potter books at the top of his list—the first books topping his list for as long as you can remember—naughty or nice? These multimillion-selling stars of bestseller lists cause some anxiety for Christians since the main characters are wizards and witches.  In fact, you may have read newspaper accounts and heard radio reports of how Christians are fighting school boards over having the books in libraries. As a concerned parent, what should you do?  We think you should read the Harry Potter books to your kids.  First, we should all be suspicious of the media's hype of Christian parents objecting to the books. Reporters love the dialectic of first presenting the Christian stick-in-the-mud who objects to or is outraged by something, followed by the "reasonable" person who demonstrates how to be both moral and fun-loving. What remains unreported is that many Christians—such as Charles Colson and Wheaton College literature professor Alan Jacobs—enjoy and defend the Potter series.  Second, Christians should never apologize for rigorously scrutinizing what influences our children. A major scandal of our day is how seldom this happens. Modern witchcraft is indeed an ensnaring, seductive false religion that we must protect our children from (see "The Bewitching Charms of Neopaganism"). But the literary witchcraft of the Harry Potter series has almost no resemblance to the I-am-God mumbo jumbo of ...            First , I would like to say that I am proud to be a "stick-in-the-mud" for my Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.  Would to God that more believers were willing to be counted amongst the unpopular.  The Bible clearly admonishes all believers in 2 Timothy 3:12...    "Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."    It is not very popular nowadays to criticize the witchcraft of Harry Potter.  Regardless, Harry Potter is straight out of hell.  Count me in as a "stick-in-the-mud" for God.  If I'm a stick-in-the-mud for proclaiming that Harry Potter is wicked and of the devil, then so be it.  Let the truth be known, Harry Potter promotes the sin of witchcraft and encourages young people to dabble into such wickedness.      Second , I'd expect to be called a stick in the mud by the heathens, but not from a professed Christian organization.  I seriously question the validity of any organization's so-called "Christianity" who would refer to another separated Christian as a "stick-in-the-mud."  Did you read what  Christianity Today recommends in the above article?  I quote, "We think you should read the Harry Potter books to your kids."  That is VERY BAD advice.  The issue of Harry Potter is an issue of Biblical separation.  All Christians are to separate from the heathen...    "Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you," -2nd Corinthians 6:17    It is wrong for anyone to support Harry Potter's witchcraft.  Mrs. Rowling's books are introducing children to the occult:     The Pagan Federation, which represents druids and witches, says it has been "swamped" with calls following teenage programs featuring good witches.  Speaking to  BBC News Online, the Pagan Federation's Steve Paine (the high priest of a coven) said the hit US drama Buffy and the highly successful Harry Potter books were popular amongst practicing witches. "They are taken as fantasy entertainment. But they do encourage people to think about different forms of spirituality", he said.  The Pagan Federation, which deals with about 100 enquiries a month from youngsters who want to become witches, does not allow anyone under the age of 18 to become a member."  Most of the enquiries are from 14 to 18 year-olds, and are dealt with "reactively" by a specially-appointed youth officer, an Essex based schoolteacher."

Third, Mr. Colson and Mr. Jacobs are carnal Christians to endorse Harry Potter (if they're Christians at all).  Any professed "Christian" who endorses Harry Potter needs to learn about the holiness of God.    "Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy." -1st Peter 1:16    There is NOTHING "holy" about Harry Potter.  Holiness is "moral perfection."  Though we cannot live perfect at all times (because we are human beings prone to disobedience and anger), we are commanded by God to try to live righteously.  It is God's Holy Spirit which comes to indwell us at salvation which gives us this desire to live for God.  I hate everything about Harry Potter, and so does God according to the Bible.    Read what the witches have to say for themselves at  http://www.witchcraft.org/books/KateWest.htm (below is a short paragraph from the above website).     "Harry Potter, Sabrina The Teenage Witch, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Charmed.  It seems we cant get enough of all things magical or 'witchy' at the moment. The result of all this interest is that Wicca has become the fastest growing religion in the UK. Wicca is a nature-based spiritual path that celebrates the feminine, follows the changing seasons of the year and is rich with magic and enchantment. But is it all spells and hocus pocus? Kate West's grounded introduction to the Craft separates the Hollywood myth from the everyday reality, with all the practical advice you need to follow the Wiccan way. There are many coffee-table pretenders around, but Kate West is the real thing. Her Witchcraft is about passion, not fashion! She explores the myths that surround Witchcraft, its festivals, beliefs, practices and folklore. She explains the responsibilities of becoming a Witch and provides plenty of magical and herbal spells you can work with - from charms to help you attract your ideal partner to healing potions for natural beauty to affirmations that will help you find empowerment. Witchcraft can help you to become personally fulfilled as it teaches you take control of yourself and your life. Whether you want to join a group or a work alone, this is a great guide to Wicca."  Did you read that..."Harry Potter, Sabrina The Teenage Witch, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Charmed.  It seems we cant get enough of all things magical or 'witchy' at the moment. The result of all this interest is that  Wicca has become the fastest growing religion in the UK ."  Are you really stupid enough to believe that Harry Potter is harmless to children?  Evidently that folks at  Christianity Today  magazine are.  Even the witches themselves declare that Harry Potter is greatly influencing the masses.     Witches have good reason to be excited about  Harry Potter . The book series is giving the "craft" a huge boost. No wonder that when interviewed by  USA Today , a warlock endorsed Harry Potter and bubbled with excitement at the series’ wide acceptance by the mainstream.   He’s a charmer, that Harry Potter. The adolescent hero of J. K. Rowling’s series rides a broom, owns an invisibility cloak and magic wand, and has cast a spell over young readers the world over. He has modern-day witches enchanted too. "For once, the witches aren’t ugly old hags," said Michael Darnell, 39, a computer programmer from Winnipeg, Canada, who has been a practicing witch for over twenty-five years. "For once they’re the protagonists rather than the villains." — USA Today , May 30, 2000     Why are the churches silent?  Why does  Christianity Today  dip their sails and compromise?  I'll tell you why!  Because of the love of money, fear of persecution and a failure to walk with God.  We all need to get right with God!   -Links to Articles Exposing the Evils of Harry Potter-   The Real Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged. http://www.chick.com/catalog/videos/0127.asp     Harry Potter 'occult' warning (News Report from the BBC). http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/education/newsid_1638000/1638887.stm     School bans Harry Potter.
