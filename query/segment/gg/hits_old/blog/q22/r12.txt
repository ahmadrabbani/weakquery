By    mj    On  05/25/2011 ·    696 Comments   ·  In   American Idol ,  American Idol 10 ,  American Idol 10 Recaps           And the Winner of American Idol Season 10 is Scotty McCreery  HOLY MOLY. From Worst. Final. Evah. to BEST FINALE EVAAHHHH! Congratulations Mr. Nigel Lygoe on a job well done. Season 10 had some bumps in the road, including ineffectual judging, over-produced performances and tired themes, but you put on one hell of a finale. It was definitely the best Season ender since Taylor Hicks and Kat McPhee battled it out in 2006. Where to begin with the awesomeness? I looked at my watch at one point, and it was already 9:30. The show was well paced, the Top 5 matched up with talent that complimented the Idol’s strengths. There were bits that were ACTUALLY LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY. Group performances were well choreographed and entertaining. The presence of joke contestants were kept to a minimum. As some of you mentioned in comments, the back end was loaded with non-Idol performances–some of which weren’t all that entertaining (I’m a U2 fan, but The Edge and Bono’s “Spiderman” musical looks like a real snore) but that’s it for criticisms, really. Although the final result wasn’t all that surprising–yeah Scotty won, just like we knew he would–the show as a whole was a reminder of how talented the Top 13 were as a whole. I had almost forgotten about that. Really good to see again were:  Karen Rodriguez (I KNOW! But her solos were awesome),  Casey Abrams ,  Naima Adedapo , Stefano Langone.  JAMES DURBIN AND HIS SIRENS. Oh crap. I was pretty happy to see everyone back together again. Now Nigel has to sit down (like he did at the end of SYTYCD last season) and figure out what worked, and what did not work this season, in order to make Season 11 truly the Best Season of Idol EVAH! Live blogging the American Idol 10 FINALE! Who will win  American Idol Season 10. We’ll find out after two hours of performances. See the list  HERE .  GET READY. WHO DO YOU LOVE? This is  American Idol ! Over 122 million votes last night. Almost 3/4 of a billion votes amassed over the season. Wow. That’s some major power voting going on!  After introducing the judges, Ryan brings  The Top 2,   Lauren Alaina and  Scotty McCreery center stage. They walk down the stairs dressed in white, holding hands. Aw. Just like angels! It’s time for shots of the finalists hometowns. And they are off to get ready for the show. POINTY POSE!  The Top 13 sing “Born This Way” Contestants making googly eyes to the camera.  Kudos to   Napoleon and Tabitha for choreographing a fun routine for the contestants. Everyone sounds and looks GOOD. –   VIDEO   James Durbin and  JUDAS PRIEST join forces! Lulz at James outfit. He looks like he’s about to go out cruisin’ with the Village People. So. Yeah. Uhm. Give metal a chance, y’all. ROCK SCREAMS FOR THE WIN. SIRENS.-   VIDEO   Next up: Video clip ragging on  Randy Jackson .  Now they are mocking “In It To Win It”. I wonder how many times Randy has actually said that throughout the season? Somebody in production needs to tally that up. “We got to get you a new writer,” says Ryan Jacob Lusk and gospel star  Kirk Franklin take the stage to sing “Smile”. Here comes  Gladys Knight ! She’s Mormon btw (fun fact to know and tell.) This is pretty much a hot mess. Franklin is testifying about tornado victims…or something. Here comes the gospel choir.  Having said all that–Jacob is right in his element. –   VIDEO   Jack Black takes the stage with  Casey Abrams to sing “Fat Bottomed Girls”.  It’s funny, but not exactly a vocal showcase. Lots of fun vocal riffing.  Girls in short shorts take the stage to dance some sort of cheerleader routine. Oh my gosh–what a pair! Perfect.  That last frame will make an awesome screen shot. Kung Fu Panda comes out tomorrow! MOVIE PLUG. –   VIDEO   Ryan promises to get the results in before our dvrs stop. The ladies take the stage with  Beyonce to sing “Single Ladies”. The girls sound good! Karen especially. BOOM FIYAH! “If I Were A Boy” Haley solo! Awesome. Oh…Check out Pia SINGING UPTEMPO like she should have during the competition. Beyonce enters to sing “Crazy in Love” with the girls backing her up. HUGS ALL AROUND. –   Part 1 –  Part 2   Steven Tyler’s video package is next. The LOOSE CANNON. Watch him swear! Watch him flirt with under-aged girls! Watch him say CRAZY CRAZY THINGS. Haley Reinnhart takes the stage with the one and only  TONY BENNETT ! Fabulous. Haley looks so pretty. Haley and Tony do a little dance! That was fantastic. Haley is AWESOME SAUCE. A standing O from the the judges! –   VIDEO   It’s  Jlo’s turn for a video package. Watch as the hopefuls fawn over her. Everybody is soooo in love with Jennifer. TLC ,  Lil Jon take the stage. “Waterfalls”.  Random! Here come the ladies of the Top 13 to sing along. –   VIDEO   Scotty McCreery and  Tim McGraw hit the stage to sing “Live Like You Were Dying”. Scotty does a nice job. Another standing O from the judges. Catch Tim on his upcoming tour! Plug. –   VIDEO   TIME FOR IDOL LOSERS. And we’re watching a clip of bad auditioners instead of a performance from  Lee DeWyze ? REALLY? Next, it’s  Marc Anthony singing some Spanish joint. I guess he’s written into Jlo’s contract. Yes? Karen Rodriguez needs to join him on stage. Nope. Wifey  Jennifer Lopez is joining him to perform a sexy sexy dance routine. Shake that booty Jlo!  Sheila E ! DRUMS! That was hot. –   VIDEO   The next video package features the contestants talking about their eliminations. HA HA. Casey, James and Stefano argue over who had the Most! Shocking! Elimination! They flash  the blowfish comparison on the screen!  You’re welcome, Idol writers. Now who is mean people? Pia coming out with the “most shocking” sash and a tiara? PRICELESS. –   VIDEO   The Top 13 boys take the stage.  Stefano does his best  Prince falsetto on “Kiss”  Paul McDonald sings “She’s a Lady” James “What’s New Pussycat” We know where this is going! Ha ha, James touches Casey’s nose when he sings “You and your pussycat nose”. Scotty sings “Green Green Grass of Home” Geez, there’s a song for EVERYBODY in the  Tom Jones oeuvre! What a versatile guy.  Jacob sings “Delilah”. Casey growls through a verse as the boys swing in unison. The guys are so funny.  Best! Pointy! Pose! EVER! Tom himself takes the stage to sing “It’s Not Unusual”. He looks GREAT. SO MUCH FUN. AGAIN AGAIN.  –   Part 1 –  Part 2   The last  Ford Music Video of the season is a montage of all the commercials with Lauren and Scotty singing “Whenever You Remember”.  Scotty and Lauren’s teachers are in the audience tonight. Oh. So the kids are giving cars to their teachers. Scotty and Lauren also get cars–any car they want! –   VIDEO   Lady Gaga takes the stage to sing her song “Edge of Glory”. She’s got some crazy beaded headress thingy on. She looks like a beaded  sphinx. Gaga has been on my nerves lately, but I dig this song. She takes off her cape to reveal a two piece outfit and a big cross necklace. She’s perched on what looks like a giant rock formation. HI SYTYCD  Mark Kanemura ! (He’s one of her dancers)  Clarence Clemons stands in the fog below to accompany her on saxophone. –   VIDEO   Lauren Alaina takes the stage to sing “Before He Cheats” she’s joined on stage by  Carrie Underwood . Aw. They’re both so cute and sassy! Good chemistry. Carrie, generously, is being careful not to showboat that big ole voice of hers, but she still outsings Lauren by a country mile.  –   VIDEO   Next Video: “ We have two 6th graders in the competition, and they are kicking our ass ” – Stefano. LOL. The other contestants talking about how young the Top 2 are. FUNNY. –   VIDEO   Beyonce takes the stage again to sing “1 plus 1″ Whoa. she’s tearing it up on this ballad. WOWZERS. –   VIDEO   The Star of “Spiderman” joins  The Edge and  Bono to sing the song “Rise Above”. A dude is flying through the air in his SPIDEY costume. Please don’t fall. Oh. Trying so hard to save this failed musical. What a boring song.   Reeve Carney , the star of “Spiderman”  kind of looks like  Kris Allen . Spidey dude almost falls on Jlo. That would have been something. –   VIDEO   Steven Tyler , on stage, at the piano, singing “Dream On”. JLO ROCKING OUT. Actually, Steven sounds pretty awesome with a band behind him and an orchestra. He hits that high note like a champ. Wow. He has not lost his voice. The song is cut short, inexplicably right after “the scream.” –   VIDEO   RESULTS ! Here comes  Edward Boddington from Telescope… DIM THE LIGHTS HERE WE GO!!! And the winner of American Idol is… Scotty McCreery !  That was anti-climatic.  The judges and the Top 13 are all on stage with Scotty and Lauren.  Ryan announces Lauren Alaina as the runner-up. She’s smiling, looking happy.  Scotty says he and Lauren have been together since the beginning and they’ll always  be together.  After thanking the Lord, it’s time for Scotty to sing.    Now he gets to sing out with his crappy coronation song, “I Love You This Big”. He hugs Lauren.He hugs his family then hugs all the Top 13 and the judges individually. He’s not singing very much. He falls to floor, crying. He tries to catch confetti on his tongue! Lauren kisses him on the cheek over and over again. THANK YOU SO MUCH, says Scotty. And we are out.

Scotty At which point I start whining,tooth-gnashing etc. Go Lauren!     chrislongisland   Team Haley is stronger than ever and post-Idol she will be VERY successful.     mozart4898   I predict no matter how much whining/tooth-gnashing/moaning/belly-aching/ never ending bitching —–it won’t be Haley.  Thank jeebus.     SouthernKradamFan   Live stream?! I have never had to watch one before, but we have storms rolling in here. I wouldn’t be surprised if the entire two hours is covered by weather. Stupid tornados.     songsungblue   Here’s the live feed:  http://www.tvpc.com/Channel.php?ChannelID=1730      St.Lucia   Live stream? We have some BAD weather here in Indiana and I fully anticipate power outage and heavy weather coverage. I figure if I lose power I’ve fully charged my laptop for a reason.  I don’t mind the weather updates, I appreciate them, but unless it is impacting me directly I don’t want to hear about it all night.     songsungblue   I predict no matter how much whining/tooth-gnashing/moaning/belly-aching/ never ending bitching —–it won’t be Haley. Thank jeebus.  At least she’ll never make my eyes bleed with her fashion choices. I would like Lauren to be kidnapped by the What Not To Wear team immediately following the finale.     songsungblue   Here’s the live stream again:  http://www.tvpc.com/Channel.php?ChannelID=1730      callmecrazy   *EXCITED*     Soberba   Looking foward to seeing Pia, Casey and Haley!!!!!! And Adam, if he shows up.     wolfsbane813   goodbye internet for the evening. this west coaster doesn’t want to be spoiled at all.     desiree_chick   Can we stop with who will be better post idol? We’ll all forget these kids after X-Factor comes on. Let’s just enjoy the final show       luval   Adam was last one on red carpet!     Kirsten   Hmmm…that recap of last night makes it look like Lauren won. Usually they re-edit it if necessary to make the judges look correct. 750M votes is impressive…     songsungblue   Oh my god. WTF is she wearing?? She makes Mikalah Gordon look classy!     Mel1   Adam was on the red carpet with Sauli in the background. They both looked so gorgeous. Talk about movie star looking couple.     kcostell   So…much…white. It’s blinding.     iluvai   Look at Scotty in white!     mozart4898   Lol seeing some of them sing a song like this is just plain funny – especially Paul, James, and Casey. Well hell, for that matter, pretty much all the guys, except Jacob.     desiree_chick   Who’s mic is so loud? Geezz…     iluvai   The girls sound better, but I love this!     iani   Man, Michelle not only “manages” DC’s career she is his date, GRRR!     Soberba   I’m getting the feeling that Lauren won.     halo9125   OMG that was delightfully cheesy- and could Stefano’s pants get any tighter? Mama Mia….     HermeticallySealed   Nothing has burned me out on Gaga faster than this season of AI. I swear they’ve pimped her harder than any of the contestants     Parkbench   goodbye internet for the evening. this west coaster doesn’t want to be spoiled at all.  Aww! I’m a west coaster that loves the spoilers! I’m excited for tonight’s show! I hope Stefano gets a duet or solo or some decent time on screen! And I’m still holding out for some last minute switch up and James is pronounced the winner! hehe But I hope it’s Scotty who wins.     mozart4898   Oh my god. WTF is she wearing?? She makes Mikalah Gordon look classy!  Who? Lauren? Maybe it’s just me lacking the female chromosome, but I’ve really seen little wrong with anything she’s worn all year. I don’t get the comments about her outfits…I think she’s looked fine. But then again I have basically zero fashion sense and have never really cared to have any, lol.     chicksineggz   Yay yay yay yay yay!!! And I don’t care how they edit it. I still think Scotty won.     idolfan92   I think the edit was slanted towards Lauren to try and build the anticipation. When everyone expects Scotty to win they have to try and make it interesting.     webster   Different state to be in: there have been seasons I paid no attention to, including the finals, there have been seasons in which I had a clear favorite whose performances I wanted to see. There was one season, last year, where I had a clear choice, but didn’t watch because I knew she had no chance of winning, and none of the others were ones I cared to hear even a little. But I think this is the first year where I absolutely don’t care who wins, they’re both ok, but really want to see the show.     chicksineggz   Jaaaaaames (: I think he sounds really good. Except, I could do without the closeups. O_O     Lucy1234   Hmmm…that recap of last night makes it look like Lauren won. Usually they re-edit it if necessary to make the judges look correct.  I noticed that too. I guess TPTB were’nt giving up on their idea of who the winner should be BUT I still think Scotty won.     iluvai   LOL James!!~!!      http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   james and JP = hella fun.       Lucy1234   James is having a blast – good for him     songsungblue   James makes me LOL. He’s like Teddy Ruxpin Heavy Metal     sooziequsie   Ok, this is where James belongs. Why would he think AI was the place for him? Best of luck to him, I hope he succeeds.       Willis   I’m in a good mood so I don’t think I’ll snark on anybody tonight. And, tonight, the KLC prophecy shall be fulfilled and hopefully the curse will be lifted.     Pam   Wow. Go James go! haha     HermeticallySealed   LOL, When James first came out my roomate pointed out that his outfit was almost the same as Rob’s character in the Brutal legend video game.     Trina   BRB dying!     mozart4898   Yeah I really think Scotty won too…and it won’t bother me because honestly I even threw him a few votes earlier in the season. I preferred Lauren but it’s no biggie. If Lauren would actually end up the winner, it’s gonna probably lead to a lot of questions in the blogosphere, lol. And James = awesome. He definitely faded at the wrong time during the season, but I still love him, and if he puts out the right music I may just be buying it…assuming he gets a deal.     TopCatDC   Did James join the Village People?    http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   That was awesome, and I love Rob H.     Kirsten   I noticed that too. I guess TPTB were’nt giving up on their idea of who the winner should be BUT I still think Scotty won.  I’m just going to believe what Nigel is telling me and be pleasantly surprised if Ryan says a different name. It’s less aggravating that way. James looked like he had a lot of fun!     kcostell   The judges “worked so hard all season long”? Really?     chicksineggz   Really? We’re going to feature the JUDGES during the finale?! Haven’t they had enough screentime?!     Kirsten   I love it when the roast Randy and his inanities.     chicksineggz   Aww, Jacob. (: I’m in a much better mood tonight than last night. And I think he sounds good too! I guess we’re finally helping the tornado victims.     Trina   Rob said such great things about him on the red carpet! That has to feel pretty good coming from a metal god! GIVE METAL A CHANCE!!! Oh and after that? Jimmy keep the hell away from him!     lizland   I wanted to like James and JP much more than I did. Don’t know why, but seemed flat. Loved that they sang these though. Glad Jame took the hat off. Looked kind of Village People.    http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   I’m enjoying this one, too, if not as much. I must be in a good mood.     Ringo   Jacob, no need to stick to the notes of the song. Sing whatever the f*ck you want dude!     iluvai   That’s really nice of them to let James have his moment and now Jacob.     webster   But then again I have basically zero fashion sense and have never really cared to have any, lol.  Ok, this is a test of the veracity of that statement: do you also think Jacob has looked basic all fine all season?     annie12120   James! Way to go – he was gone way too soon – can’t wait to see how he does post AI. Jacob… I do like Jacob, but that is just a mess lol     halo9125   Hmmm…I haven’t missed Jacob.     Coldbluesteel   I love this for Jacob     songsungblue   I love gospel, but this song is kind of….meh.     mozart4898   Lol I don’t remember this church being in my living room   I don’t mind it though. Jacob’s not everyone’s cup of tea, hell, he’s not exactly mine, but he’s good at what he does.     turquoisewaters   Suddenly I love all non-country singers.     iani   Some more @$$ kisses for those millionaires(judges)! James great, Jacob good!     annie12120   can’t get back to my first post I just wanted to know if we get to buy anything tonight at iTunes? Like the James performance?     mozart4898   Ok, this is a test of the veracity of that statement: do you also think Jacob has looked basic all fine all season?  Lol. The one week he wore that mismatched suit or whatever it was…that was pretty ridiculous. Other than that, nothing else he wore stuck out as that bad. At least, I can remember that one pretty crazy outfit and nothing else. Honest.     CindyM   I liked Jacob’s performance   LOL that they have time for a duet of JLo and Marc, Steven’s song and now comical clips of the judges (nonjudging) but couldn’t spare two minutes for Lee? Nigel, you liar.    http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   I am enjoying the enthusiasm for sure.       Willis   I really did like this season. I think everybody is talented is some way. They are all Beautiful! Fun Jacob song. Not sure why Kirk was yelling at the audience over Jacob and Gladys singing though.     callmecrazy   Omg I am still trying to recover from James and Judas Priest….that was beyond AWWEEESOME! *faints again*     Pam   I liked the Gladys Jacob Kirk Franklin combo. Jacob looked like he was having fun. Good for him.     Lisa   Lauren and Scotty, who walk down the stairs dressed in white, holding hands. Aw. Just like angels! ***spews dr pepper all over her desk*** LMAO      chicksineggz   Casey!!!!! I am loving this duet. That was kinda a mess, but I don’t care, it was so much fun.     jammasta   What song(s) did James and Judas Priest do? I’m excited for that one!     sagi   Looked kind of Village People.  LOL!That was my first thought. But James had a couple of spots he sounded really good that I really liked, and a couple of spots I could have did without.     Pam   Here comes Casey and Jack Black. Fat Bottomed Girls! Hee     halo9125   Casey is far more talented than Jack Black.     Lucy1234   Lauren seemed so happy in the opening number – I really think she is just happy and relieved to have the competition over. They are both winners and she knows it. Casey is a little pitchy dawg.     leome   Jack Black is one of those people I always like and who makes me smile or laugh but I always end up forgetting about him. He’s a talented dude.     songsungblue   It’s not good when Jack Black outsings you       Coldbluesteel   I may look at this a little differently but I don’t care if the Idols are in tune or not. This is a reward for them-it may be a highwater mark for several of them so I love James w/ JP and Lauren w/ Carrie etc. just for the kids.     Ringo   Casey and Jack Black with the Three Stooges Scat!! lol     mozart4898   Ok, I like Casey…but why did they saddle him with this? I would have so much rather he done something with, say, Esperanza. Or really go out there and get Wynton Marsalis to play trumpet with a little jazz combo and have Casey play bass and sing. This is just a damned farce and Casey’s a lot better than this.     kcostell   Casey was fun to watch and the duet was terrifically funny, even if the correct pitch was rather…lacking.     Lisa   Fat Bottomed Girls too funny! Pretty much sums up the final this year……a joke LOL     kcostell   You’d think after 10 seasons Ryan would know how to ad-lib and fill time better     leome   lmao The reference to what happened in season 7. The recording stopping when Ryan was revealing the results and right after he said David and before he said the surname was hilarious. Hot mess by the girls tbh. But they’re all so pretty.     chicksineggz   What the heck is Karen wearing. I don’t really like the songs the girls are singing. But Haaaaaaleeeeeey! Okay, this is reminding me of how I didn’t really like the girls this year except for Naima and Haley. And these girls are so much better than Beyonce. I didn’t see the need for all the extra backup dancers.     jrain   That can’t be good for Casey’s career. It was funny though.     Indigobunting   Suddenly I love all non-country singers.  Lol, I like Country music, but yeah, I kind of feel the same way. There is some energy in the air. I thought James was fun-the guy gives it all he got. The gospel number was a little rough to listen to but fun too. I’m on DVR, a little behind, ha.     mozart4898   IMO, Haley sounded the weakest of any of these girls in her little solo part. No competition. Naima and Karen both blew her away. Thia sounded great, Pia sounded great. Eh, just me probably.     songsungblue   Karen is soooo sleepy, but her voice is pretty.     certain1   This looks like hookers on parade. Why is it every year they do this to the girls       jrain   Just more Beyonce pimpage as her single is flopping.     keware   Girls in red…rocking it!     iluvai   Naima and Pia sound really good.     Dakota01   I don’t remember some of these girls. Pia is gorgeous! She sounds great.     iani   Ha, ha, love the gradual vampy style of girls! Now the diva, really talented artist, love her!     songsungblue   God, Haley is so damn good. But Pia? Still kind of low rent Kardashian to me. And shrill…     Lucy1234   Girls are sounding pretty good and there is Beyonce     OvenMitt   Ok, I like Casey…but why did they saddle him with this?  To be fair, Casey himself said he wanted a career like Jack Black’s (WTF?) when Rob Reiner talked with the Idols. I guess Nigel considered this to be a gift to Casey. Erm….     chrislongisland   Haley was the strongest. Jacob sounded EXCELLENT     HermeticallySealed   This is going on way tooo long.     Lisa   Yay Beyonce! Jlo check her out, that is a real singer LOL     kcostell   I said to myself “man, whoever this Idol was she was a really weak singer”. Then I turned around, and it was Beyonce singing.     MrDuffin   That can’t be good for Casey’s career. It was funny though.  I disagree…Jack will put him in a movie..     Ringo   Eh, just me probably.  LOL, you’re nothing of not consistent Moz.     TopCatDC   At least this year they didn’t turn the girls into a backup group for the guest star.     Lucy1234   My hubby just perked right up when Beyonce entered the stage and gave her a standing O, first one he’s given all season lol.     lizland   Casey and Jack were fun. A bit ridiculous, but on purpose, which this show needs sometime.     Willis   The Beyonce tribute was one of the best things I’ve seen on Idol! Everyone sounded their best. Beyonce is what the mean when they say “having IT”     luval   Am so glad Beyonce didn’t sing her new single. yuk     desiree_chick   God, Haley is so damn good. But Pia? Still kind of low rent Kardashian to me. And shrill…   IMO, Haley sounded the weakest of any of these girls in her little solo part. No competition  I thought Haley and Pia sounded fabulous and kicked ass. How about that?       MrDuffin   Yay Beyonce! Jlo check her out, that is a real singer LOL  They are interchangable….they look and sound just alike and can’t sing live at all…     mozart4898   To be fair, Casey himself said he wanted a career like Jack Black’s (WTF?) when Rob Reiner talked with the Idols. I guess Nigel considered this to be a gift to Casey. Erm….  Yeah ok, I didn’t hear that. I mean, if Casey’s a comedian along with being a musician (and I think they’d said he’s quite the jokester), he could probably have a very similar career…but it’d be one I’d be much less likely to be interested in.     chicksineggz   Haley haley haley haley haley!!!!     BrightLights   I turned the TV on right in time for Haley- which is good, because this is the only part of the show I actually care about…     Kris   I liked the Beyonce tribute. I thought the girls sounded good. I especially thought Karen sounded great singing Beyonce. I like Ashton’s solo as well.     october   Why did the girls go on and on and on and on singing a Beyonce medley and when Beyonce comes out she only sings a verse worth of lyrics? Weird.     Lisa   Haley is sooooooooooo good & Tony is sooooo old. He alive?     iluvai   This is Haley’s perfect kind of music.    http://twitter.com/lindsav  adamland   James and Rob/Judas Priest were awesome. LOVED IT!!! mozart4898 says: 05/25/2011 at 8:32 pm IMO, Haley sounded the weakest of any of these girls in her little solo part. No competition. Naima and Karen both blew her away. Thia sounded great, Pia sounded great. Eh, just me probably.  IA so it’s not just you.     luval   Haley looks so comfortable with Tony Bennett. Just her style of music I think.     mozart4898   NOW, this is what Haley should be doing. She sounds fine on jazz, because that’s the sort of voice she has. Putting her in the pop mix just doesn’t work for her, and that’s why every one of the other girls seemed to blow her away when that’s what they were singing. This sort of sound suits the tone and timbre of her voice.     fuzzywuzzy   So Casey sings a joke song with Jack Black and Haley gets a really cool duet with the legendary Tony Bennett. Yep. That’s about right. LOL!     Lucy1234   WOW, I didn’t think Haley would be in the first hour. I remember in Season 8, they had Allison, Danny and Adam in the 2d hour right before the big announcement. Didn’t really watch last year so don’t know the order. Maybe Haley will get to sing her single in the 2d half.     Pam   Loved Haley’s duet with Tony Bennett!     songsungblue   HALEY!!! That was awesome.     iani   Well, Haley may not sell mil. with that kind of music, but she will be a millionaire only singing this music! Now JLo’s time for kiss!     kcostell   Woot! Jazzy Haley’s back!     lizland   The girls really sound good together. This could be one of the better finale medleys they’ve done. Weird that Lauren isn’t part of it. I thought the final 2 participated in these.     Indigobunting   I liked Haley toward the very end of the competition but I agree with Mozart-she did not sound good during that number; it sounded like she was growling/talking, not singing. Pia and Naima did sound the best to me.     chicksineggz   Haley was amazing.     chicksineggz   TLC?! Well I guess it’s nice to put these four girls with them. EDIT: sorry for the double post.     songsungblue   I love how Haley doesn’t sound like anyone else. So, IMO, she was by far the best. YMMV and all that.      http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   TLC seems wrong without Lisa Left Eye.     MrDuffin   A good duet with Haley and Tony Bennett. He can be alot of help for her career…yayyy Haley!     luval   TLC is just not a fit for this finale. So random.     iani   3/4 TLC resurrected ?     Valentin432   TLC? I don’t think they should use that name as a duo     Ringo   Did I miss Lauren in the Beyonce tribute? Not sure she could sing or dance (or fit into one of those dresses) but maybe it’s just the live stream.     leome   Scotty sings first so he’s the winner… right?     Parkbench   Aww Naima is trending on Twitter!!!!    http://twitter.com/lindsav  adamland   Love Tim McGraw! Home state boy’s done so good!     Willis   I think this is the best Scotty has ever sounded. I like this!     Indigobunting   Haley sounds good with Mr. Bennett!     chrislongisland   Haley with Tony = performance of the night so far. Jacob and Gladys also was awesome, as was James and Judas Priest.     steph6449   Scotty is out of his league on this one, lol. At least it’s not Real Good Man, that would be more than a bit much   Tim doesn’t look too thrilled to be doing it.     PamReid   Tim McGraw is showing Scotty up – sorry – just NO comparison.     iani   Scotty is good, he will have a good career for sure, as well Lauren! Happy for them!     lizland   I love TLC, but this is so random. And the girls again? Where are the dudes? and the final 2?     fuzzywuzzy   Love Tim!       songsungblue   Tim McGraw is not my thing, but man can SANG.     chicksineggz   Scotty! Aww, see I like country when it’s mixed in with other stuff (:     iluvai   Scotty and Tim sounded great!    http://twitter.com/lindsav  adamland   That’s the best I’ve heard Scotty sing. Like the higher register.     luval   Yeah, the “L” in TLC is unfortunately not with us anymore. This still seems like a low-key finale.     mozart4898   I thought Scotty sounded as good or better than Tim McGraw, honestly. IMO he’s gonna be huge.     Miss Chaos   Hey West coast here, would love to hear the names of the songs the kids are singing, Thanks     Coldbluesteel   It takes bawls to sing a duet with McGraw or Carrie.     Lucy1234   Question – I know Kris sang in the first half and he won. Did Lee also sing in the first half? Just curious. Even though I know Scotty has it in the bag, I like to look for clues. Tim is one good looking guy.     PamReid   mozart4898 says: 05/25/2011 at 8:56 pm I thought Scotty sounded as good or better than Tim McGraw, honestly. IMO he’s gonna be huge.  I mean this in the most sincerely positive way, but have you had your hearing checked lately?       Pam   I quite enjoyed Tim and Scotty. Yeah, it is weird to see TLC as a duo.     chicksineggz   Really? REALLY?! You’re showing us this crap (bad auditions) and you had no time for Lee?! I mean I don’t even think Lee is that great, but he definitely deserved a performance.     Ringo   Pam sez: I mean this in the most sincerely positive way, but have you had your hearing checked lately?    Fell out of my chair laughing!    http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   Ummm… I didn’t watch the auditions for a reason.     HermeticallySealed   Not a fan of country or McGraw, but he pwnd Scotty. Scotty’s voice was just thin and weak when he tried for higher range.     songsungblue   LOL  Pam ! And your eyes,  mozart4898. **virtual hug because even if I disagree, I still heart you**     keware   Great job Scotty! I’ve been wanting him to sing that song ALL SEASON!!!!     Ringo   Desi Arnez!!     mozart4898   I mean this in the most sincerely positive way, but have you had your hearing checked lately?   Nope, I haven’t. Just saying that as a musician and music fan myself. Tim’s voice actually sounded thinner than Scotty’s. Could have been the TV sound, I dunno, but that’s what I heard. And for that matter, keep in mind that I favor Lauren over Scotty so it’s not just bias for Scotty talking…     iani   Now time for the “bad and the ugly”! And the other half of JLO! Man! Copacabana, hola!     CindyM   Oh god. Marc Anthony. With showgirls. There’s the production money right there..lol  He looks drunk.  One big commercial for the judges, eff the kids.     Lucy1234   Love me some salsa. Go Mark!!     luval   Uh…JLo coming out to sing with Mark Anthony I think.     HermeticallySealed   And now, because he’s screwing one of the judges, here’s Creepy Anthony.     certain1   Marc Anthony is auditioning to be the next Desi ..with JLO as his Luci     Indigobunting   Why did Tim look so uncomfortable being there? Or is that just how he always looks, lol? He’s usually so much more animated when I’ve seen him sing.  Don’t like Cowboy hats, but the man does have it going on.     askew3   I loved the Beyonce #. All of the women were fun. Haley and Karen killed it during the #. When Beyonce came out you could see why she is a superstar. She has mad charisma.  Haley sounded great with Tony Bennett. Why wasn’t Pia in the TLC #? She had better not be getting a solo later in the show or that would be BS.     jbuddy25   “Ringo says: 05/25/2011 at 8:51 pm Did I miss Lauren in the Beyonce tribute? Not sure she could sing or dance (or fit into one of those dresses) but maybe it’s just the live stream.” yeah, it’s the comments like these that REALLY make me mad. it’s a singing competition, not a weight competition. people are just plain old rude. she’s only 16. have a little bit of respect, people. i don’t even think she’s THAT fat. a little chubby, sure, but she’s from the south. Ha, it’s kind of their culture a little bit. so, everyone, just shut up about people’s looks. it’s a SINGING competition. keep it that way.     eyelinerandcigarettes   What the heck Scotty? Why didn’t you sing like that yesterday?     PamReid   OK, this Marc Anthony/JLo thing is just making me really uncomfortable.     mozart4898   Question – I know Kris sang in the first half and he won. Did Lee also sing in the first half? Just curious. Even though I know Scotty has it in the bag, I like to look for clues.  I thought Crystal sang in the first half and Lee in the 2nd half. I might be wrong though, but I could have sworn they went almost right from Lee with Chicago to Crystal and Lee with Joe Cocker, then the results.     TopCatDC   Mark Anthony – fantastic singer and entertainer.     halo9125   Ay caramba dios mio.     annie12120   but he pwnd Scotty. Scotty’s voice was just thin and weak when he tried for higher range.  I had the same thought… Scotty is a one note pony and was out of his one note element there     luval   haha family friendly ass shaking.       songsungblue   Wow, Mark Anthony just p’owned everyone. And I kind of hate him.     ReginaFilange   Casey vs James doesn’t seem very goodspirited.     Pam   haha mj. They showed the blowfish faces.       fuzzywuzzy   Mega promotion not only for JLo, but for Marc Anthony too. Ugh. Is it just me, or are these skits really lame?     chicksineggz   WTF Marc Anthony. Yeah. Pia was the most shocking. Lol. Hehe, Casey, James.     MrDuffin   Jennifer can’t sing but she sure is pretty!     iluvai   Casey James? Casey and James????     Lucy1234   That clip with Casey, James and Pia as who’s the most shocking was the best so far.     annie12120   Ryan just said Casey James, didn’t he? LOL     jammasta   ROFL This most shocking thing is hilarious! Especially the blowfish face nod  . Stefano sounds like he has a crab in his pants o_O.     Marly5   TopCatDC says: Mark Anthony – fantastic singer and entertainer.  You are right, he’s great specially live.     luval   I like the guys much better. Stefano had a nice falsetto.     fuzzywuzzy   Oh, James is having major pitch problems.     TopCatDC   James singing Burt Bacharach?     askew3   Oy, Scotty was bad with Tim McGraw. He definitely doesn’t have the voice or the stage presence yet to be a big country star. I loathe the audition nonsense during the finale. It’s so mean. And did J-Lo and Marc Anthony learn nothing from the disaster at the GRAMMYS a few years back? Marc is fine solo but J-Lo just isn’t talented enough to keep up.     iani   Now the silly (James and Casey)! And dancing in black on Tom Jones’ music! Panties, please!     leome   The Shocking clip was actually hilarious.     Valentin432   Chicken Little > James Durbin (only for that song)     Indigobunting   Oh, man, more judge pimpage. I love the shocking boot bit- awesome.   James and Casey are so funny together     brie200   I thought Scotty sounded pretty good with McGraw, and I’m not particularly a Scotty fan either. I wish he had done more of that last night to be honest.     chicksineggz   Since Pia wasn’t in the TLC thing, that means she’s probably getting a duet? But that means Paul deserves a duet. And Stefano. And I really don’t see that happening. Hey how come Scotty is in the boys number but Lauren isn’t in the girls number?     littlefishie   Oh dear… James had to sing in his lower register… Not good… >.<     iluvai   Why is Tom Jones on this show? Does he have a new album or something??     fuzzywuzzy   Sir Tom still has it. Casey really IS only a joke performer.     Ladyhelix   Why do the dudes get more “tuneful” selections (a good melody) – whether they sing it well is a crap shoot… Casey is very likeable – Delila.     mozart4898   Hey how come Scotty is in the boys number but Lauren isn’t in the girls number?  *shrugs* Maybe she really did actually damage a vocal chord and, you know, she’s resting her voice so she doesn’t ruin it forever? That would kinda make sense to me.    http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   The shocking skit was funny. Loved the Tom Jones medley. Jack Black sure was getting into it.     Parkbench   Hahahaha Chris just tweeted: James and I makin the same face! Hahaha! Nice. I looked stupid:)  Nice to know he can laugh at himself!     windmills   I think they’re resting LaurenA. Maybe she wasn’t in the rehearsals for this either because of her voice. I can’t confirm this but I read on a Carrie fan board that she and LaurenA pretaped their performance for tonight too.     sgills   Hey how come Scotty is in the boys number but Lauren isn’t in the girls number?  Probably saving her voice for her duet with Carrie? Honestly, this might possibly be the most entertaining two hours of television I’ve ever seen (but don’t tell LOST or 24 that). Can’t wait for this tour.    http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   Yeah, I’m not sure if Pia should get a duet over those who lasted longer than her. Oh, well, if it happens. They are trying to promote her with her single coming out soon.     Pam   Loved the Tom Jones medley. Jack Black sure was getting into it.  Yep. He was getting his groove on. heh     askew3   Oh for fudge sake, Scotty is singing country during the Tom Jones medley. What a tool. Sing something else for a change. Pia had better not get a duet later than James, Jacob, Haley and Casey that would be complete BS.     iani   NO! Stefano no jacket! AI stylist should be fired! Tom Jones’ last year single was “I’M Alive” lol, still in voice though.     Lucy1234   Hey how come Scotty is in the boys number but Lauren isn’t in the girls number?  Looks like she will be singing a duet with Scotty now. I suspect she is trying to rest her voice as much as possible. I know she didn’t do interviews last night.     chicksineggz   LOL. The teachers get the Fords this year? And the kids get to pick whichever Ford they want! I feel bad for Lee and Crystal. They both got stuck with that car they designed. =P     Valentin432   Wow that’s really nice to give cars to the teachers     Pam   The teachers are getting new cars. This is different. That was nice that Scotty and Lauren got to present the keys to their teachers. Ahhh Ryan gave out the keys this year.     iluvai   Love Scotty and Lauren with their teachers. Everybody gets a Ford!!! woo hoo!!!     littlefishie   GAGA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     Marly5   I just don’t get Lady Gaga. What is the appeal?     Trina   This is the best finale!     chicksineggz   I think Lady Gaga sounds good. But I’ve heard her WAY too much this season.     Ladyhelix   It’s our Mark (with Gaga!)     Valentin432   Mark Kanemura is getting major screentim with Gaga       jammasta   Lady GaGa turned from Rita Repulsa from Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers to Xena, Warrior Princess with Scotty McCreery’s cross necklace.     iani   GaGa in good style, has longer hair! Is she jumping down?! Yes, she does!     luval   Isn’t that Mark from SYTYCD? He is such a terrific dancer. Has been in every GaGa video I think. Many other things too.     TopCatDC   That’s Mark Kanemura from SYTYCD Season 4 up on the mountain with Gaga.     certain1   Does Lady GaGa ever wear pants …never been so tired of seeing someone in their underwear.     ReginaFilange   Gaga can sang.     keware   I love the idea of giving favorite teachers a car. Good for FORD!     Lucy1234   I love Lady Gaga – enuf said     Indigobunting   OH wow, is Idol really showing me major shots of GaGa’s crotch?!     PamReid   Lucy1234 says: 05/25/2011 at 9:28 pm I love Lady Gaga – enuf said  I have tried SO HARD to hate her, but I just can’t. She is SO talented and what an entertainer.     chrislongisland   LOVED seeing Mark with Gaga in a solo dance! Can’t wait to see SYTYCD tomorrow!!!!!     littlefishie   Lauren has nothing on Carrie, and it’s even more obvious in this duet…     ReginaFilange   Big mistake, Idol. The only way people will accept Lauren as a good singer is if they forget bout Carrie Underwood completely.     Willis   I loved Edge of Glory! Gaga’s album is fantastic. No, Lauren… Hi, Carrie!     TopCatDC   I just don’t get Lady Gaga. What is the appeal?  Gaga is a performance artist that has infiltrated the mainstream music. She’s brought gay disco back to the pop charts. Not everyone’s cuppa, but it’s a nice change from a parade of teenage synthesized pop princesses.     chicksineggz   Carrie! Can’t have a finale without her. And yay for Lauren.     jammasta   Lady GaGa is too freaky for me.  Carrie is outsinging Lauren.     october   I feel bad for Lee and Crystal. They both got stuck with that car they designed.  LMBO! Apparently Ford had a more profitable year this year.     luval   Haha…camera pulled back a little from the crotch. Gaga’s a hoot.     CindyM   I do believe that Carrie’s shorts are shorter than Haley’s. Y/N?? LOL     certain1   Lauren is holding her own with Carrie     PamReid   Lauren doesn’t have anywhere near Carrie’s range, but she is doing a MUCH better job hanging with her than Scotty did hanging in with Tim McGraw.     Coldbluesteel   Wooooooot!     Willis   Lee sighting!     Lucy1234   Lauren has the cutest smile and she held her own with Carrie, which is not easy.     fuzzywuzzy   This duet with Carrie is good! It would be even better if Lauren didn’t have vocal problems. Well done!       TopCatDC   There’s Lee peeking out from behind Ryan. Now you can’t complain that he wasn’t on the finale.     halo9125   I do believe that Carrie’s shorts are shorter than Haley’s.  But were they tighter than Stefano’s pants? He was hitting those high notes with ease, lol.     Indigobunting   What is it with all the women wearing shorts/underpants tonight? Much better interaction between Carrie and Lauren; they look a little happier singing together than Tim and Scotty. Lauren is kind of whispering, voice trouble.     chicksineggz   Hey look it’s Lee! But Ryan is covering his face.     jrain   Beyonce sounds rough…more pimpage     JudyL   SO MUCH FUN. AGAIN AGAIN. Hah, hah mj……I just knew you were loving these group numbers. This finale is making up for last night’s snorefest!      songsungblue   Lauren has the cutest smile and she held her own with Carrie, which is not easy.  I thought she sounded like Carrie had come upon her singing karaoke. She lacks her range and vocal abilities. I think Lauren = Emperor has no clothes.     askew3   Carrie has grown so much as a performer it is amazing. Lauren looks so amateurish next to Carrie. Even Carrie wasn’t this green on her season. But, she was still 100% better than Scotty with Tim McGraw.     fuzzywuzzy   I like Beyonce, but I don’t like this song.     chicksineggz   Wait. Why are we listening to Beyonce again?     CindyM   LOL. This finale is so not about the contestants. If this had happened during Season 8′s finale, I would have wanted to cut someone.     leome   What is it with all the women wearing shorts/underpants tonight?  It’s hot and lets us have a great look at their beautiful legs. I, for one, am happy about it.     PamReid   Not loving Beyonce, but my 18 year old son just walked through the room and said, “Man, she’s hot!” Explains a lot – LOL.     Parkbench   But were they tighter than Stefano’s pants? He was hitting those high notes with ease, lol.  Stefano is wearing tight pants!?!?! I can’t wait to see that! =D     jammasta   WHY MUST PEOPLE WEAR BASEBALL HATS THAT ARE NOT IN THE ORIGINAL TEAM COLOR?! I both love and hate you Stefano. BLACK AND ORANGE OR DEATH TO ALL HAT WEARING PRIVILEGES.  Sorry, just had to vent. Love Stefano for liking my team, but wearing the hat in a different color bugs, for some reason.     Marly5   chicksineggz says: Wait. Why are we listening to Beyonce again?  That’s a very good question.     october   Who is the black girl that keeps showing up whenever the girls from the top 13 sing? I do not remember this young lady in the slightest.     iani   1+1=2 performances, the power of diva! That song is for Jay Z, please! Lauren great!     PamReid   Interesting factoid: According to WNTS, Carrie holds the record for the lowest ranked Idol performances for ALL winners. Tonight’s winner will break her record.     Lucy1234   Who’s left to perform? We have 15 minutes left.     Elliegrll   So, for years Beyonce would only clear one of her songs for use on AI, and they decided to reward her for that by giving her three opportunities to promote her new album. Placating her is more important than giving airtime to former contestants.     chicksineggz   LOL. This finale is so not about the contestants. If this had happened during Season 8?s finale, I would have wanted to cut someone.  Oh I was so mad about S8′s finale. I think this one is much better with regards to making the focus about the contestants.     songsungblue   This is why I don’t care for Pia. You can command a stage with a ballad. She just doesn’t. She’s dull.    http://www.amadcow2.com  amadcow2   wow, hope spiderman doesn’t fall to his death     Lucy1234   Oh, forgot about Bono and Spiderman. I thought maybe Lauren and Scotty would do a duet but guess not.     renataamelo   Ok I want this cute guy from spider man to be the next idol!     Indigobunting   Wow, she is phenomenal!     Willis   I feel bad for Lee. Not even a mention of last years winner? Bumped for Spiderman. Sad times.     desiree_chick   But were they tighter than Stefano’s pants? He was hitting those high notes with ease, lol  I APPLAUDED that comment. LOL Whew! Oh man…     Lucy1234   I was just going to comment that I thought this year seemed a little less about the contestants than in years past. We seem to have more big artists performing by themselves and not with the contestants than in years past.     Elliegrll   Oh I was so mad about S8?s finale. I think this one is much better with regards to making the focus about the contestants..   This year’s contestants have had a greater role than season 8′s. The medley’s are longer, while season 8, aside from Kris and Adam’s duets and the ending, was all about the contestants singing back up for the established talent. I also like the funny skits that we’ve seen with this year’s cast. My problem is the lack of former idols.     halo9125   Clearly Pia is not debuting her single- that’s abundantly clear. Steven Tyler still has to sing Dream On- by then it should be time for the coronation.     ReginaFilange   wow, hope spiderman doesn’t fall to his death  Now THAT would be a finale!     Indigobunting   Danny Gokey’s new commercial just came on my local Fox during Idol commercial break. Very cute       iani   Not bad, Bono, you both look good for your 50′s!     steph6449   Lauren did decently with Carrie, especially once she got more into it. Her voice did sound a little wrecked though. Scotty’s voice has not sounded great to me this week either (thin, creaky, off key at times). Though I don’t particularly care for him, I haven’t usually found his actual voice to be that much of a problem. Maybe they are both having vocal issues or just the anxiety of the week is affecting them. . Since they are about to run out of time, does that mean Scotty (err, the to-be-announced winner) won’t have time to sing his winner’s song? Or are they not doing that as both finalists did their “singles” last night?     mozart4898   This is why I don’t care for Pia. You can command a stage with a ballad. She just doesn’t. She’s dull.  Lol we’re just on different pages tonight I guess. I made a comment here a minute ago but I guess it didn’t post. I loved Beyonce’s song, and I really have never liked anything she’s done, at least that I’ve heard. That was so full of emotion…I thought it was great. Of course it also sounded like the sort of song that’s often the final track on an album and I frequently love those tracks, whereas a lot of people I think often are bored by the stripped down instrumentation. I’m weird sometimes when it comes to music though, what can I say.     luval   Never thought I would say it but I feel awful for Lee too.     songsungblue   Oh no, I meant that BEYONCE was great. And that Pia was dull.     iani   Now ST time not to be wasted! He’s good!     chicksineggz   There is way too much focus on the judges. We need judges that don’t have current singing careers.     Valentin432   Steven still has it. Finally a proper Dream On scream on the AI stage.     PamReid   Take THAT Danny Gokey!       Willis   The Ford commercial just congratulated Scotty. LOL Whoops!     Lucy1234   I would have rather listened to Scotty and Lauren do a duet than Steven right before the announcement but oh well seems to be as much if not more about the judges. And now it is about time to crown Scotty the winner. I guess their were no new singles from Haley or Pia, guess that will be later after Lauren and Scotty have a chance to get their singles out as it should be.     Indigobunting   aside from Kris and Adam’s duets and the ending, w   Danny dueted with Lionel Richie (and had a solo at the beginning). Allison dueted with Cindy Lauper. Oh, Steven, too many drugs     adamlover   turned it on late, is adam there?     Pam   Steven may not be the greatest judge, but he’s still a great performer.     chicksineggz   It’s 10:00! Surprised there was no Lauren/Scotty duet.     luval   Looks like it’s going to go a few minutes over.     HermeticallySealed   Oh yuck. But expected.     CindyM   This year’s contestants have had a greater role than season 8?s. The medley’s are longer, while season 8, aside from Kris and Adam’s duets and the ending, was all about the contestants singing back up for the established talent.   Really?? We’ve had 4 performances that had nothing to do with Idols at all, not even singing the introduction. In Season 8 – were there any?? Season 8 you had the idols singing with Santana, the girls with Fergie, Lil had a duet with Queen Latifah, Danny had a duet with Lionel Richie, Allison had a duet with Cyndi Lauper, Michael Sarver and Megan sang with Steve Martin, the guys sang with Rod Stewart, Anoop and Alexis sang with Jason Mraz etc.     iani   No! 4 men in the row (jk)! Congratulations to Scotty!     songsungblue   The Lord didn’t do a damn thing, Scotty.  So wait – Lauren didn’t have bitchface? Heh.     annie12120   Oh, who dresses Lauren? That is just so bad! lol     chicksineggz   Yay for Scotty. Soooo adorable. Not enough initial reaction shots. I LOVE YOU THIS BIG!!!! =P (god what a lame song.)     Willis   Here James, hold my trophy. Cold Scotty.     Valentin432   Not surprising but sweet moment.     annie12120   yay! 4th WGWG! LOL That was just so not exciting     Willis   The winner eats confetti. This may be the best season for me.     PamReid   A very sweet moment and his “I love you babe” to Lauren was cute. Don’t feel the best contestant won, but I wish him much luck.     Indigobunting   Surprise, surprise, its Scotty. Scotty fans-you get no thanks, lol, only the lord got him there. Congrats Scotty!     Pam   awww that was really sweet. Lauren and Scotty looked like they were ready for prom. Too cute. She seemed really happy for Scotty. I think she just got a bad case of nerves last night along with her voice too.     Parkbench   Yay for Scotty!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =D     october   I cannot believe Steven agreed to sing such a severely truncated Dream On. The tidbit we got was great, but wow, it was short.     Lucy1234   Very nice ending and all is right with the world. Scotty was very gracious and as I knew she would, Lauren handled herself with grace. You can tell that this a close knit group and that Lauren and Scotty are very close. As a Lauren fan I am happy with the ending as there would have been complaints if she won and now she can be the rightful runner-up with all the perks of the winner. Also, Scotty made me a fan tonight, maybe not of his music but of the person, very mature for such a young age.     HermeticallySealed   Surprise, surprise, its Scotty. Scotty fans-you get no thanks, lol, only the lord got him there. Congrats Scotty!  LOL, because you know, the Lord doesn’t have anything better to do than ensure some twink wins a karaoke contest.     TopCatDC   Unfortunately Scotty is stuck with that horrible song.  turned it on late, is adam there?  Yes, he and his boyfriend came in on the red carpet and did some interviews. He didn’t show up in the broadcast, though.     CindyM   LOL Danny Gokey is trending after Steven Tyler’s Dream On.. No duet for Lauren/Scotty??? Even Crystal and Lee got that.     brie200   I can’t hate on Scotty. He seems like a good kid, so congrats to him. I do feel bad that the song he has been saddled with for his single is so bad though.     Lucy1234   So wait – Lauren didn’t have bitchface? Heh  Nope, only Haley does that lol. Have never seen anything but a sweet face on Lauren or tears. Congrats to Scotty. It was very nice of him to say that Lauren was with him from the beginning and they would still be together. Guess so, as they will be label mates, tour mates and probably doing publicity together. Being runner-up aint so bad.     zzatrms   Oh, who dresses Lauren?  They have full control over what they wear. They announced for quite a while the final would be 2 hours and 7 minutes.  I loved the group numbers. Loved the guys best.     jpfan   Hooray, I had Scotty pegged as the winner from the auditions. I think that’s the first time I’ve ever predicted the winner that early. Lucky for me I had no favorites this season so I didn’t get sidetracked. The ones I like tend to go 3rd or 4th.   That show was kinda of awesome/kinda hot mess. My favorites moments: Scotty/Tim duet, Carrie w/Lauren, the girls doing Beyonce. Ugh: Anytime Casey Abrams was on the screen, all those awful plugs after the act performed.     Mel1   Spidey (Reeve Carney) is Adam’s friend. I bet they get together after the show.     PamReid   Lucy1234 says: 05/25/2011 at 10:12 pm Very nice ending and all is right with the world.

I wish him a great career – which unfortunately won’t get a kick start with that awful song. I predict that Lauren will do well. It might take a couple of years, but we will be hearing her on the radio – her voice records beautifully.     CindyM   Yes, he and his boyfriend came in on the red carpet and did some interviews. He didn’t show up in the broadcast, though.  There was one shot of him in the audience at the beginning of the show, that’s about it.   ETA: Amended my post cuz there are pics of Sauli on the red carpet.     eyelinerandcigarettes   YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     AvalonL   And the Kristy Lee Cook prophecy is fulfilled! Was it just me or did Scotty and Lauren  kiss each other on the lips ? They looked like lovebirds.     Elliegrll   No! 4 men in the row! Congratulations to Scotty!   He was the most consistent out of the top 13. Even though I want to see a different type of winner, honestly he deserved it more than anyone else.     iRazRazz   I didn’t really care either way I would hav been fine with either of them winning. But I’m so glad to see Scotty win! He’s majorly adorable  Can’t wait to see him on tour!     MrDuffin   Funny as hell…PT Barnum couldn’t have done it better. A sucker born every minute if you believe Scotty really won by the most votes all season…he was moved forward by TPTB the whole season…the votes never mattered.     jpfan   I saw Lauren kiss Scotty a few times on the cheek. But yes they kind of did look like a couple. Aw, that would be so cute. Actually, even they’re not a couple they should pretend to be. That would def sell more tour tickets.   I also like the bit where they gave their teachers the car. Scotty’s parents also deserve a price. They really raised a nice kid.     Willis   I thought this was the best finale I can recall. I could have lost the Spiderman song but loved everything else. Shame Pia’s performance got cut  I think Scotty was the right winner and he’ll do fine.  I wish Larry King didn’t retire. I loved the group interviews after the finale.     brian_ny1976   this finale was an absolute disaster…scotty and lauren the stars of the show supposidly were irrelevant the entire show everything was either…caseys face…beyonce..lady gaga…u2..this show sucked hard!! and lee dewyze was sitting 2 rows behind jennifer love hewitt…how come he didnt get to perform? its almost like last season never existed…that was awful!!! but jlo and marc anthony singing and dancing some spanish crap…blahhhhh…of course steven tyler had to get some face time…he couldnt sing with james though right? thats disgusting!!! fuck this show!     spanishfan   There will be a major breakout star there and I predict Haley Reinhart. Loved the show and my Cookie but also loved the guys together, the girls together major and the comedy scenes. I do not see anything special in Lauren and prefer Scottie.     iluvai   This was a great season. I loved seeing all of the top 12. Congrats to Scotty and Lauren. They were the two I least wanted to see in the finale, but I thought they did an awesome job.     singer man   the nuts of wonder are victorious hey jordan dorsey,karma’s a five letter word ain’t it,lol     spanishfan   There will be a major breakout star there and I predict Haley Reinhart. Loved the show and my Cookie but also loved the guys together, the girls together major and the comedy scenes. I do not see anything special in Lauren and prefer Scottie. PS I saw Lee Dewyze sitting in the audience, so he was invited.     chicksineggz   Was it just me or did Scotty and Lauren kiss each other on the lips? They looked like lovebirds.  I think it was on the cheek, but I don’t know, his back was turned. Either way, those two are adorable. (I think they’re just friends though)     blmetsfan   Congrats to Scotty! And a great show.     Girl   This has been a great year for AI. But third year in a row, the winner’s made me absolutely wet myself laughing at the sheer absurdity of it all.     Lucy1234   Was it just me or did Scotty and Lauren kiss each other on the lips? They looked like lovebirds.  From what I have read on twitter, nothing would make their young fans happier. They do seem sweet together and unless they are great actors, genuinely like each other. Scotty seems very protective of Lauren and she looks at him for approval before she answers in interviews and seems to look up to him – it really is quite cute.     flyaway   Please, please someone post the Tom Jones mess! Best part of the show (although Haley was great). James touching Casey’s nose. Jacob dancing like he meant it. Looks between Paul and James. More, more, more! Will be the only clip I’ll play multiple times.     Mel1   Sauli wasn’t on the red carpet, he hung back with Lane and there was one shot of him in the audience at the beginning of the show, that’s about it.   Did they show Kris? He was sitting behind Adam. There was a tweet that said Kris and Adam talked to ea other at every commercial break.     iluvai   I think it was on the cheek, but I don’t know, his back was turned. Either way, those two are adorable. (I think they’re just friends though)  Scotty said, “I love you baby”, when he hugged Lauren. He also said “I love you man” when he hugged James. Awwww…       Lexus   A couple of times tonight I wondered if Jordan Dorsey was watching. Remember when Scotty wanted to join his group during the audition phase: “Um, No! Just no!”. Guess Scotty got the last laugh tonight. Hee Hee! BOOYA! Awesome finale with an awesome result! Scotty is one talented, sweet, mature and classy guy! Loved his family throughout this too. Best parts in order: 1) Scotty’s ‘hugout’ 2) Tim McGraw and Scotty 3) Steven Tyler!!!!!!!!! 4) Carrie and Lauren 5) The Beyonce medley with the girls 6) Spiderman feature – Reeve Carney was great on vocals! 7) Jack Black – anytime the camera was on him     Grammie Kari   It was an excellent Finale – one of the best!! I was happy to see Gladys Knight (Motown) on again with Jacob. Nice job! James was looking like he had a ball – maybe they (Juda Priest) will have him as a Guest Singer sometime in the future? Honored to see Tony Bennett and Tom Jones perform. Loved the boys singing Tom’s songs! Beyonce was great as usual. Lady Gaga was unusual. LOL! Enjoyed Marc Anthony with Jennifer. So many great singers, but I still missed the alumni coming back to sing. I loved seeing the friendship that developed between Scotty and Lauren. It’s funny because Lee made the comment about him and Crystal being together from the beginning – just like Scotty said. Oh, you do remember Lee, right? He’s the guy that won last year and was sitting behind Ryan as he spoke of the show. It would have been nice to see Ryan shake hands and ask, “How have you been buddy?” Better yet – let Lee sing! My husband made the comment that it looked like Carrie was trying to outsing Lauren. I didn’t notice that, but with Lauren’s vocal problems or not, that would be easy to do. Did anyone see other American Idol winners there besides Lee and David Cook? I need to rewatch the show. So much going on – very fast paced! I had Scotty third after Pia and James. I think he’s a sweet guy and I wish him well with his career! Congraulations to all the Scotty fans – and Lauren’s fans too!     jpfan   Forgot to add some more things I hated: Marc Anthony looking like a crackhead, Beyonce’s solo, Gaga solo, the guys medley (that was one fugly bunch of dudes), Steven Tyler getting the pimp spot and the fact that as horrible as S9 was, Lee Dewyze should have been given 2 minutes to come out and pass the torch. Lexus, except for Tyler I agree with you list 100%.       NOLA   Congrats to Scotty!!! Congrats to Lauren!!! Great finale!     iluvai   Since I never added my 2 cents on this topic, I also agree it was shameful that Lee wasn’t part of tonight’s show. That’s really lame.     tomr   Great result! Out of 10 seasons, I have picked 7 winners and 2 seconds from the audition rounds. Should have wagered each year…I could have retired by now. Congratulations and best wishes to Scott and Lauren. Thank you, mj, for providing this blog for us.     TopCatDC   Funny as hell…PT Barnum couldn’t have done it better. A sucker born every minute if you believe Scotty really won by the most votes all season…he was moved forward by TPTB the whole season…the votes never mattered.  “TPTB” doesn’t count the votes. They’re not that stupid. The votes are counted inhdependently by Telescope Inc. If Telescope allowed the votes to be altered then their reputation would be shot and their business would be over.    http://www.myspace.com/gundomom  CarieB   Cannot believe AOL spoiled the results on their home page. Fox is going to kill them!     CindyM   LOL Danny: dannygokey Omg why is Danny Gokey tending?? Did I die and I don’t know it??  4 minutes ago via HTC Peep     luval   haha Jack Black didn’t get a hug.     swish5   Congratulations to Scotty and Lauren Just hated the “up close and personal for each of the three judges – so sick of the focus on the worthless judges. And, JLo on stage with Marc – must have been part of her contract negotiations.  Hard to compare Season 9 to 10 – so different (more money spent Season 10 judges and productions). Best to Lee & Crystal (Crystal should have been invited back also….)     Trina   Aww big congrats to Scotty! Loved that whole winning moment and it was the cutest thing how he kept hugging everyone. This was the best finale!  Steven Tyler kicked some serious ass. After the endless JLo pimping he deserved that closing slot. I loved that cheesetastic Tom Jones medley way too much. So, so happy for James and the whole JP thing. Metal royalty indeed. Cant stop smiling! His Top 12 performance is what made me become a fan so <3     TopCatDC   Since I never added my 2 cents on this topic, I also agree it was shameful that Lee wasn’t part of tonight’s show. That’s really lame.  Idol winners who did not perform tonight (besides Lee): Kris Allen Jordin Sparks Taylor Hicks Fantasia Barrino Ruben Studdard Kelly Clarkson     mandabutter   Great finale! The entertainment kept me glued, barely wanted to get out of my seat. I wanted to see more David Cook tho, even if to just redeem himself from the first camera cutaway of his “I just slammed my hand in the door” face @ the start of the show. I loved Kirk Franklin and Gladys Knight backed by gospel choir. Jacob didn’t make me turn up my nose or lose my lunch with his OTTness so he gets a pass.    http://youtube.com/user/ConcertCameraCat  Sparkles   This group looks like they will be a lot more fun on the tour than last year’s group. Maybe we will even get some shenanigans similar what David Cook & Michael Johns did during their tour. At least Scotty isn’t afraid to act goofy so he should be entertaining even if you don’t like country songs.     Mel1   There are some of the cutest pics of Adam and Sauli posing on the red carpet, holding hands. That has to be a first for Fox/American Idol. I hope he isn’t pissing off anyone (like Murdock).     Grammie Kari   Can it really be over? It was a pretty good year with a lot of talented contestants. I hope some of those in the TOP 60 will come back and try again. Some terrific talent was passed by. Anxious to hear how the tour will go. It would be wise to start off with Naima, even if Thea was out first. She’ll be a perfect starting act! Congratulations, Scotty!  MJ, thank you for keeping up with this topic (show) and all the others you cover! You are an awesome reporter AND I do appreciate you!       Lexus   My husband made the comment that it looked like Carrie was trying to outsing Lauren. I didn’t notice that, but with Lauren’s vocal problems or not, that would be easy to do.  I had the opposite impression. I thought Carrie held back in respect for Lauren’s vocal problems. Carrie’s usually a lot more powerful and growly on that song.  I agree that it was shameful that Idol showed such disrespect to the outgoing Idol, Lee. In very, very poor taste and I’m glad so many people noticed the slight.     BeachBum   Hands down, THE WORST SEASON OF IDOL EVER!!! When the winner was so blatantly obvious throughout the ENTIRE season, it renders the show a complete joke. The bigger problem is that everyone involved is laughing all the way to the bank!! “Ugh. That’s All.”     edbert_john   It seems that Nigel’s last minute pimping last night failed. I’m not a Scotty fan but I guess he deserves it than Lauren.  I love the performances tonight especially the rock performance of James and Judas Priest. I also like Haley’s duet with Tony Bennett. I guess Steven’s performance is superb but it seems that Idol’s time is running out so he perform too short. BTW, I also like Lady Gaga’s performance! Meanwhile, the irony is that the Top 2 (supposed to be the highlight of the finale!) gave us two lousy performance but thanks to Tim McGraw and Carrie Underwood for showing up onstage! They save them!     SajiNoKami   Great duets, Epic Guy group number, Gaga awesome, minimum awkward ryan, and Scotty won… I am pleased with this American idol final. \o/ James! awesome as ever. that guy group number, they clearly do not take themselves seriously, have no fear in what others think, and that made the number that much better. i swear the s10 really embraced the group number aspect of ai, they really seem to like doing it.     chicksineggz   Idol winners who did not perform tonight (besides Lee): Kris Allen Jordin Sparks Taylor Hicks Fantasia Barrino Ruben Studdard Kelly Clarkson  The point is, Lee won last season. The winner of the previous season has always come back to perform. Even Taylor Hicks performed after the year he won. And they didn’t even acknowledge Lee. Heck, Ryan was standing RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. He could have said something.     bbmom2boys   It would be different if all of you who had such important opinions had any talent besides trashing talented kids on these blogs! What scares you …is it that they are young, is it that they dress normal, is it that they believe in God? So sad! If country music is not your thing…I get that! But your trash mouths and your disrespect does nothing but make you all look like the idiots you really are! Scotty and Lauren are at least making something of themselves how many of you have a paying job?     Susan   IMO, Haley sounded the weakest of any of these girls in her little solo part. No competition. Naima and Karen both blew her away. Thia sounded great, Pia sounded great. Eh, just me probably.  Not JUST you. I cringed throughout her solo in the medley. And then muted the duet with Tony Bennett. I. Just. Hate. Her. Voice.     windmills   What a great finale show! Honestly I think I enjoyed this one more than any other AI finale from beginning to end. The quality of performances was really good and what a big affirmation of s10′s talent. I’m so happy the focus was mostly on s10. The only things I would’ve liked a little more of were: the support from the hometown watch parties and a Scotty/LaurenA duet. I guess them singing Whenever You Remember for the ad was supposed to be enough.  I didn’t feel like there was much focus on the f2 but I’m OK with that in that the strongest aspect of s10 has been the diversity and depth of the talent. I thought the girls KILLED it on their Beyonce medley: Pia, Karen, and Naima were standouts and Ashthon and Thia were pretty good. Pia, Karen, Thia, and Naima had me thinking about what could’ve been had they made it further into the season. I loved Beyonce’s little moment of interacting with the girls too when she joined them. Haley had her moment during her Tony Bennett which was awesome as expected. LaurenA and Carrie were cute together. Grammie Kari: My husband made the comment that it looked like Carrie was trying to outsing Lauren. I didn’t notice that, but with Lauren’s vocal problems or not, that would be easy to do.  LOL no. That was Carrie holding back. You could see her encouraging LaurenA to take the front part of the stage at one point. Carrie closed the song with a flourish but up until that point she was definitely holding back. I thought their chemistry was nice to see. The boys medley was a lot weaker and more uneven but it was still pretty entertaining. James had his moment with Judas Priest and I really think Scotty more than held his own with Tim McGraw. Jacob acquitted himself fine with Kirk Franklin and Gladys Knight. Casey & Jack Black were entertaining.  The non-Idol related performances were fine too. They were spaced out enough IMO.  This is how to do a finale. What a great celebration of S10. Hope this season’s people rock it on tour and enjoy success after the show! It’s been fun ya’ll! EDIT: Scotty is a class act as a winner. I loved him hugging each of the finalists, saying their names (well just Casey’s!), giving them what he probably thought was a moment on the camera. Loved what he said about LaurenA too. Good job Mr. and Mrs. McCreery.     Reflections On Life   Stephano singing Prince was HAWTT!! Why didn’t he do anything like that during his AI run? Also floved Karen, Pia, and Haley in their Beyonce solos. Haley w/ Tony Bennett = wonderful. great opp to sing with one of the greats before his time comes up. Too many celebrities singing w/o AI contestants, not enough former AI winners. Other than that, what an entertaining finale! I just watched for the entertainment. Caught the Scotty win later on the TV news. I envision Scotty & Lauren 20 yrs from now, married, kids, their youthful singing careers behind them, running a husband-and-wife singing ministry, maybe a show on PTL or cable. Kinda like Kirk Cameron (formerly of Growing Pains). Best of luck to them both!     Caffiend   I’m thinking the reason there was no Scotty-Lauren duet was to preserve her vocal chords. Lauren was absent for the girls’ group numbers as well, while Scotty was in the guys’ numbers.     Willis   CarieB says: 05/25/2011 at 10:46 pm Cannot believe AOL spoiled the results on their home page. Fox is going to kill them!  In my area they ran a Ford commercial for Scotty right before the result. I loved Beyonce (both times) and Gaga. I thought Karen and Thia sounded real good. Really, all the other girls had pop voices so Haley stood out more to me. And, that was a lot of choreography to learn for one show. Hats off to everyone! Yes, Casey came off as a joke contestant, but he doesn’t seem to mind. As long as you’re entertaining.     chicksineggz   Hands down, THE WORST SEASON OF IDOL EVER!!! When the winner was so blatantly obvious throughout the ENTIRE season, it renders the show a complete joke. The bigger problem is that everyone involved is laughing all the way to the bank!! “Ugh. That’s All.”  Did you not watch S4? Carrie had the most votes every single week. I guess the show didn’t exactly show this, but I know this season Randy said James could win it.     mandabutter   Fave moments off the top of my head: 1. Haley and Tony Bennett (tied with the Scotty crown/win) 2. Beyonce Medley (Gold stars for Karen, Haley, Thia and Pia. In that order. How fierce was Thia with some of those moves?? She had some stage presence in SPADES. Wow. Didn’t see that coming.) 3. Video packages: both, These top2 are young y’all (LOL) and “Who had the most shocking boot?” Yes loved the blowfish faces, Casey ripping on himself – Guess what we still think u suck. And Pia with the sash and crown. “What are you two discussing? Yeah, thats what I thought.” 4. Gaga and Mark 5. Marc Anthony, Sheila Freakinnn E! 6. Seeing Lauren sing with Carrie. She must have had lead butterflies going on and she did well for being exhausted. I flipping loved this season! And thats alot seeing as tho I didn’t wanna watch after Tim Halperin and Kendra didn’t make top13.     brian_ny1976   bbmom2boys ….its called freedom of speech …each and everyone here are entitled to their opinions..and will do so…carry along now     Susan   Did James join the Village People?   I need to see a video of this lol. All I noticed about his outfit is that he looked a bit slimmer.  Rock on, dude! Although I prefer more melodic stuff, metal with a melody is ok.     lizland   I just caught up on my Tivo, and that was a bore. I’m indifferent on the result, and didn’t even watch yesterday but was hoping for a better finale. Maybe it’s because there was no tension as to who would win. There were a few good parts – the girls medley, Casey and Jack for the LOL, Haley and the old guy, Lauren and Carrie (although Carrie is 1000x better at this stage), even Steven Tyler singing Dream On.  But Scotty’s signing of his single had to be the worst ever for a finale. He certainly wasn’t bothering to sell it and what little he did sing was completely out of tune.     Indigobunting   Lol, Danny Gokey is trending. I think probably some hate started it because of Dream On but now he’s getting all kinds of love, plus a rumor he is engaged to Beyonce LMAO   He is his usual good sport about it too: Danny Gokey OMG Why is Danny Gokey Trending??? Did I die and not know it??        Nostradamas   ZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz…………..     milwlovesadam   I really don’t care who won tonight. I’m not interested in their music.  Highlights of the show to me: Gaga Haley with Tony Bennet. Sublime and fantastic. Loved her dress too. Tom Jones-baby he’s still got it. James with Judas Priest. The comedy bits. The group numbers. The lows: Casey with Jack Black. Jacob. Beyonce getting two numbers and former Idols being left out. Especially Lee. And Adam was in the house without even a camera shot of his gorgeous face.     chicksineggz   But Scotty’s signing of his single had to be the worst ever for a finale. He certainly wasn’t bothering to sell it and what little he did sing was completely out of tune.  Lol. I don’t have any problem with not really singing the coronation song well. It’s a terrible song, and I’m sorry that Scotty is stuck with it. I mean, Kris was able to ditch his song, so maybe Scotty is seeing if he can do the same.     mandabutter   Great for Steven Tyler! Love him. DO is not my fave song from Aerosmith but great moment. He’s really turned things around. Loved seeing Tim McGraw on that stage. Big platform for him, not that he’s hurting.  I did, however, think Ryan was an ass most of the night. Bummer. Did he really push Lauren and Scotty to have their first kiss on his radio show??! If I was Lauren’s dad I would seriously wanna have some words with TPTB. Gross.     sgills   Great show tonight. Happy for both of them, even though I was routing for Lauren. The great show put me in a great mood, so I’m probably taking this a whole lot better than I would have if the show sucked tonight. Plus that love-fest at the end was so freaking sweet I couldn’t stand it – Thanks to that American Idol sign off, I’m probably on the on-set of diabetes. Hoping Lauren singing that KLC song, and Scot”ty” winning officially ends the Kristy Lee Cook curse though. Quick, someone find out her confirmation name!     Masieta   I’m trying to envision Scotty & Lauren singing “We are the Champions” with Queen… Naw… just doesn’t work…     Joyed   As boring as last night’s final performance show was (and I REALLY like this top 2) tonight’s finale was one of the best in the show’s history. The legacy acts still felt relevant, the artists of today (Beyonce, Gaga) have gravitas. The comedy clips came from the idols rather than desperate actors hocking movies. I laughed so hard at the Casey vs. James shocking boot-off. (I wonder if Pia kept her sash) The girls sounded amazing on all of their numbers tonight – clearly the boys are the weaker link when it comes to harmonizing but they sure are amusing! Scotty’s win was definitely not a surprise – I told my mom months ago he would win (of course Lauren was my pick in the pool, though, lol). He was great tonight – when he is in the moment he is charismatic and viable rather than too silly to be taken seriously. I did joke on twitter that he only hugged his loved ones in the audience in order to ensure that he wouldn’t have to sing the entirety of his wretched single. (Although it wasn’t as bad tonight as it was yesterday). Basically, tonight capped off why this was a good season despite some of its flaws. Thanks for saving idol Season 10!       Lexus   But Scotty’s signing of his single had to be the worst ever for a finale. He certainly wasn’t bothering to sell it and what little he did sing was completely out of tune.  Most coronation singouts are pretty bad given the excitement of the moment. Honestly, I’m just relieved I didn’t have to endure it again tonight. That’s not a slight to Scotty, but the song itself. I’m convinced he was looking for a way out of it too and opted for the hugout. lol Scotty’s win was definitely not a surprise  It wasn’t for me either. I really believe he was leading this thing all along. So happy for him!     Parkbench   James performance was amazing!!!!! And I loved seeing Stefano in the BTW performance!     tripp_ncwy   h2oconvo #Kris & Adam were talking to each other during like every commercial break #idk. Adam & Kris were on the aisle so I could see them better. Plus Adam is so tall & easy to spot #left orchestra #Adam left the floor before Dream On for some reason. Don’t think he came back #Kris was directly behind Adam. Cook was in same aisle but near end closer to judges table     Elliegrll   It seems that Nigel’s last minute pimping last night failed. I’m not a Scotty fan but I guess he deserves it than Lauren.   Maybe not. It was highly unlikely that Lauren would win, but Nigel still wanted to set a record for number of votes, so they purposely tried to bus Scotty, knowing that it would galvanize his fans, just like similar tactics made many of David Cook’s fans vote more and longer than they normally would have.     MayMirabella   Steven at 63 is fantastic, how does he do it at his age? He sounded beyond great…best performance of the night. And Tony Bennett at 85 and performing with Haley, amazing. His voice is so smooth, it still melts butter. And Tom Jones, a hottie old guy …of course I am getting up there in years…so I find these old guys hot too now…but he sounds fantastic and looks even better.  Casey was funny with America said to me, You suck and then later they said, You suck again. LOL..that made me laugh and how they were saying things like Scotty and Lauren were Children, still has Similac on their breath, were 6th graders, cannot write in cursive , can barely drive, belong at the prom.  And I must admit, that little bit with Casey and James scripted argument over most shocking boot and then PIA walking in with the crown and sash…was well written..LOL And did anyone notice not only did Lauren take it well, she was hugging and kissing Scotty and as she went in to kiss him on the lips right after the annoucement, the camera panned. But my southern dad told me a long time ago that it is not shocking for platonic friends and family members to give a quick kiss on the lips to friends and loved ones who are not their spouse or gf.     mandabutter   But Scotty’s signing of his single had to be the worst ever for a finale. He certainly wasn’t bothering to sell it and what little he did sing was completely out of tune.  He was following AI tradition. Seriously. EVERY coronation song is sung badly and out of key on Winners night. They are crying, out of breath, overwelmed, exhausted – viewers are certainly not expecting a true professional & vocal technician in that moment. Kelly was rough on “Moment”, Fantie, Carrie, Taylor, Jordin, David (he was better than average), I can’t speak on Kris. And then, Lee. Possibly worst sing-out ever. But he was consistent. And I’ll stop there.     songsungblue   It would be different if all of you who had such important opinions had any talent besides trashing talented kids on these blogs! What scares you …is it that they are young, is it that they dress normal, is it that they believe in God? So sad! If country music is not your thing…I get that! But your trash mouths and your disrespect does nothing but make you all look like the idiots you really are!  Scotty and Lauren are at least making something of themselves how many of you have a paying job?   Why, are you hiring at the trailer park?  Oh snap! Just kidding, bbmombb….or should I just call you Mrs. Suddeth?  Awesome finale! Great song by Beyonce! Amazing Haley and Tony Bennett-off! Thanks Nigel – I’m glad you didn’t dig up anyone this year [Literally].  I didn’t think James was all that great with his solo, and I thought Scotty was weak-sauce with Tim McGraw [who my sister has worked with, and says is a true gentleman], and Lauren was barely keeping up with Carrie.  Now if Lauren would just BURN ALL THOSE AWFUL CLOTHES. Gah. My eyes!     windmills   Joyed: I laughed so hard at the Casey vs. James shocking boot-off. (I wonder if Pia kept her sash)  Me too! I loved the pageantbot snark too with Pia wearing a crown and sash. Casey and James killed it with their lines too. The Idols doing these skits worked SO much better than the usual comedic actor skits they’ve done (usually involving Jack Black and/or Ben Stiller).     alonzo7   I for one really enjoyed the finale although it felt like the 2 kids were afterthoughts-like, oh yeah let’s announce the winner-no duet or anything and no home town interviews-Scottys crowd was humongous!!! I confess I finally voted last night and had my first winner in 4 seasons-I was afraid to jinx Scotty as I voted for Archie,Adam and Crystal. Wonder if a girl is ever gonna win again-she will have to be something special!!    http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   I must be the only one who had a lot of fun with Jack Black and Casey. I absolutely do not think he’s a musical joke, btw. What he is is someone who is on a cheesy reality show and knows how to laugh at himself. I think that’s kind of awesome. I loved Haley and felt she was very respectful to Tony. He totally kinda flubbed it in the beginning, but pulled through. Very charming performance. James and Judas Priest! Rock on. He had so much fun and so did I. Oh, the Casey/James/Pia skit? Too funny. Tom Jones medley… fun! I didn’t like Stefano’s version of KISS. He tried to do it like Prince and no, he’s no Prince so it was jarring. Carrie was very sweet to hold back and not totally wipe the floor with Lauren, who must be really suffering. I hope pushing through didn’t do any major damage to her vocal chords, because she has pipes and a promising career.  Scotty knows his song is ridiculous… I think he even laughed at one point when he sang the title lyrics. Or he could have been overwhelmed with emotion. Good luck to him. I thought Lady Gaga was meh as far as the production goes. It may have been exciting live, but on TV it didn’t translate for me, for you. Good choice in dancers, though. Danny Gokey trending is kinda funny.  Enjoyed Steven, but the prize of the night (in terms of the established artists) goes to Beyonce on her second song.  Oh, and Marc Antony? He does look emaciated or something.     lla2827   I enjoyed the finale. Even though I know some wanted Casey to bring out his jazz chops–and I would have loved that too–his duet with Jack Black was fun and entertaining. I know Casey loves Jack Black–so its all good. I doubt that the performance will hurt his music career at all (as someone mentioned awhile back). Folks know he is a musician and all that. It may even give a boost to him doing some acting in the future. Loved seeing Haley with Tony Bennett. That was so nice. I also got a kick out of the shock boot video with James/Casey/Pia. That was cute. Really enjoyed the Tom Jones medley–cheeky and good fun.  I did think there was a little too much Beyonce. I think she is a very good singer–but I rarely like the songs she does. The last one she sang–same chords over and over. Drives me crazy.  Wasn’t surprised at Scotty winning-since most of us knew it all along.     MayMirabella   h2oconvo #Kris & Adam were talking to each other during like every commercial break #idk. Adam & Kris were on the aisle so I could see them better. Plus Adam is so tall & easy to spot  Kradam sighting…!!! Cool !! The fan fic will live on with a Kradam sighting.  I wonder if there will Scotren fan fic after her kissing of him tonight and him saying in the most wholesome sweet platonic way that I love you baby. I bet there will be..LOL     Lexus   And then, Lee. Possibly worst sing-out ever.  But he was consistent . And I’ll stop there.  LOL – I can’t argue that!     NOLA   Willis says: 05/25/2011 at 8:52 pm I think this is the best Scotty has ever sounded. I like this!  I agree, Willis. I trink Scotty had “his moment” with that song.     Parkbench   Aww! I liked Jacob’s performance! I like his energy/vibe.     lla2827   I must be the only one who had a lot of fun with Jack Black and Casey. I absolutely do not think he’s a musical joke, btw. What he is is someone who is on a cheesy reality show and knows how to laugh at himself. I think that’s kind of awesome.  We must have been posting at the same time–LOL ITA–I think some of what Casey does in def done tongue in cheek. I think he is my fave idol of all time. Talented–but doesn’t take himself too seriously. I think that guy is meant for a career in show business     movin2thabeet   I enjoyed alot of the show tonight – the F2 were the weakest link IMO. In no particular order, loved Beyonce, Gaga and Mark, Haley and Tony, Casey and Jack, Steven doing his thing, Mark, Sheila E and Jennifer, many of the group songs/routines and all the comedy moments. The depth of the talent this year was really apparent tonight. I don’t think Scotty is really all that but taken as a whole, this season and finale were entertaining. So congrats, AI!     phil25   I loved this finale, something for everyone. I would have liked to see a Pia duet but I understand the fairness issue.  The first hour of the show was incredible.     kvwicks13   I was waiting for JLO’s kids to come out and perform. Everyone said season 9 was about the judges…..season 10 has been about self promo of judges…..and family members too!     steph6449   I wonder if there will Scotren fan fic after her kissing of him tonight and him saying in the most wholesome sweet platonic way that I love you baby. I bet there will be..LOL   lol     songsungblue   I trink Scotty had “his moment” with that song.  I love when Scotty sings! It provides a perfect opportunity for a bathroom break       abbysee   This was an awesome finale. Steven, Jlo incredible performances. Steven in particular is …….. ugh, no words.  Scotty McCreery is an awesome kid. I wish him much success. Him and Lauren Alaina should hook up and get married and have little country singing idol babies. Cuteness abounds. Tonight made up for last night’s snoozefest, they had such fun tonight and it showed in their performance. Seeing all the kids together reminds me of the solid talent they chose this year. It might have gone off the rails at the end, but not because of the talent.  I am happy, finally I pick a winner, been wrong since season 5. The curse of Kristy Lee Cooke becomes prophesy and is fulfilled! LOL! I love the sense of humor of these guys, it’s gonna be a fun tour.     MayMirabella   Aww! I liked Jacob’s performance! I like his energy/vibe.  I really liked him on the boys numbers especially the Tom Jones number even more than the gospel number except I am a huge fan of Gladys Knight.  Gaga can sing, what a voice!! And Beyonce on that last song, wow !! Both have great pipes !!     CRB   Haley is AWESOME SAUCE  Finally, mj and I agree about a contestant….it only took six seasons!     idolfan92   I’m still mad Idol wouldn’t let Lee sing. What, so we could see more clips of bad auditions again?! Oh yeah, that’s much better than your reigning American Idol. At least I get to see him live on his tour next month =)     sue   I am so excited that I moved up to number 9 on the pool. YES! As for the finale it was pretty good. I wish Casey/Jack Black would of done a serious number, they both can really sing. I love them both regardless. Poor Jack didn’t get a hug from Scotty, lol.   Haley was fabulous, I wish they would of had her sing with Buble or someone younger. lolz  It’s all good, she is great. Sadz that she didn’t get to sing her single yet.  It sucks that Lee didn’t get to perform, it really was wrong of idol. boo…  Overall it was a pretty great finale. Congrats to Scotty and Lauren, they seem really close. It was cute how she kept kissing his cheek. awwwwww……     PamReid   Lexus says: 05/25/2011 at 10:37 pm A couple of times tonight I wondered if Jordan Dorsey was watching. Remember when Scotty wanted to join his group during the audition phase: “Um, No! Just no!”. Guess Scotty got the last laugh tonight. Hee Hee! BOOYA!  I had completely forgotten about that. I guess it all worked out for Scotty – LOL.     tripp_ncwy   I can’t speak on Kris. And then, Lee.  Most agreed that Kris sang NB better after he won than he did on performance night.     Parkbench   I missed Thia and Naima! They so sounded good! They all sounded good except for Haley. She sounded terrible! Her voice annoys me. Bleh. Ashton sounded a billion times better than Haley with the “If I Were A Boy” song.     kvwicks13   Lee and Jonna looked amazing. Lee should have been acknowledged as the reigning winner. Nigel has no class.     CindyM   milwlovesadam: And Adam was in the house without even a camera shot of his gorgeous face.  You just missed it.

(some good shots) http://mix1041.radio.com/2011/05/25/american-idol-finale-pictures/#photo-1      NOLA   Oh for fudge sake, Scotty is singing country during the Tom Jones medley.  I guess you think his accent is put on. LMAO     aizjanika   I enjoyed this finale so much more than I thought I would. I had to start it late and watch the recording, though I stopped it to watch Scotty win live, then went back to the recording. This also allowed me to skip over all the boring stuff.  I agree that Beyonce and Steven Tyler killed it. I loved seeing Tony Bennett and especially Tony Jones. I *love* Casey so much, but I could not stomach watching him murder Fat Bottom Girls with Jack Black. I had to skip over that. I also skipped over Lauren singing with Carrie and Scotty singing with Tim McGraw. I hate the song the girls sang, but I *really* really hate that song by Tim McGraw. In my musical world, that is clearly one of the worst songs every written. (And I actually kind of like Tim McGraw, but just can’t stand that song even for a second.) I was surprised at the group numbers. I thought all the girls sounded good. I was especially surprised at Ashton. I wasn’t very impressed with her in the competition, but she sounded pretty good tonight. I loved Haley on If I Were a Boy. The only thing better would have been if she got to sing the entire song by herself. I loved Beyonce coming out to sing with the girls.  All in all, great fun, great finale. Scotty was adorable winning. I didn’t mind that he couldn’t pull it together to sing the horrible coronation song. It wasn’t a *moment* like David Cook’s win, but it was sweet and fun.  Also, I was very glad Scotty won. I wasn’t happy with the final two, but I felt like Scotty deserved it way more than Lauren and I think Lauren will do just fine without the win. What happened to Haley singing her new song on the finale? Was that just a rumor? I guess I’ll read the rest of the comments to find out.  I was hoping I could hear it and then buy it soon.     yaddabing   The finale is probably my favorite one ever, so props to you Nigel. Just fix the voting, because the final two were the least exciting of the night. I did buy Rise Above 1, so Interscope did get my money tonight. Now, give me Pia and Haley’s singles.     swish5   Lee and Jonna looked amazing. Lee should have been acknowledged as the reigning winner. Nigel has no class.

Parkbench   Well I like Tony Bennett but I won’t be watching that performance. Her voice still annoys me. >= [     tripp_ncwy   It was funny that twitter exploded when Ryan announced Scotty was singing LLYD. A lot of people on twitter mis-took what he said as Kris’ LLWD. LLWD also got a little boost on iTunes.     Junior   I just finished watching James sing with J.P. and i’m dizzy from the swirling cameras. I realized as I watched this that those swirling cameras were part of the problem this season! It’s hard to connect to a performance as an audience member when the camera won’t stay freakin still!     carolinacharms   What a great recap to a beautiful finale show! The best contestant won tonight.     sunchick   pj says: 05/25/2011 at 11:18 pm I must be the only one who had a lot of fun with Jack Black and Casey. I absolutely do not think he’s a musical joke, btw. What he is is someone who is on a cheesy reality show and knows how to laugh at himself. I think that’s kind of awesome.  I resemble these remarks. Jack Black is massively charismatic and Casey threw down and didn’t seem intimidated at all. Im just saying, I bet Casey totally knows the words to F*ck Her Gently, which makes two of us.   Also enjoyed James/Judas Priest (and lol at Durbin rocking the JP trademark Village People Biker Dude look), Haley/TB, Steven Tyler showing he still has pipes and Gaga taking a stage dive with the sublime Mark Kanemura. Conversely, were we supposed to be impressed that J Lo can shake her ass? Cuz I wasn’t feelin it  . I would never in a million years buy a Scotty album, but I have no beef with his win. You can’t help but be a little impressed with the maturity and poise he has for his age.     Mtlfan   that was a very good show! Loved Haley with Tony; it seemed too short to me but how sweet! Beyonce on the 2nd song was just amazing… Very good group performances! I like much seeing Bono tonight and Steven was very good; geez he lost nothing when it comes to the ‘dream on’ scream.. kudos. ( so funny to see Danny gokey trending..) Gaga was good; i like her song on the chorus So the kids got no Ford car for themselves? (only their teachers?) Scotty win was so no surprise; congrats and good luck to him! Lauren has a great voice; if she grow more personal style, she can have a very nice career     Jae   Yay! Finale over! I liked a lot of it.  1) Scotty won! So adorable in the end as he sang his song and hugged all his family and friends. It was the right cheesy coronation song after all. 2) Gaga: Cool! But I thought they were going to blur her on stage fake sex antics 3)Beyonce! Love her! My girl crush.  4)Jacob with Kirk Franklin and Gladys Knight! Best idol + guess performance of the night 5) Haley with Tony Bennette. How cute was that??? i really liked it.  6)Casey with jack Black. Hilarious! Casey should totally be in movies.  7)James with JP: Hated it. I thought it was a mess. Maybe because I dislike metal and James had already performed the only JP song I sort of knew. returning idols:Was cool to see everyone back.   9) Steven and Dream On! : the old dude still has it! The memory of Danny’s scream exocised forever!     Tess   So Lauren didn’t break down into a puddle of tears…Haley & Pia didn’t get to usurp the winner’s crown by singing their upcoming number 1 pop hits…Steven Tyler put James mediocre performance in perspective. I think that the forecasts for the final were slightly off-base. All I have to say is that it is a wonderful feeling when a kid who seems to be really likable and enthusiastic, without pretense, who isn’t afraid to show affection to his parents, friends and fellow idolettes is crowned the winner. Sometimes nice things happen to what appears to be a really nice person.     mandabutter   Maybe we will even get some shenanigans similar what David Cook & Michael Johns did during their tour.  Yippee! Color me excited. I’m looking forward to the tour. All the guys seem to have a genuine friendship. We shall see.       Parkbench   I love that Tim McGraw song! I like that performance! Scotty and Tim sound good together!     Jae   So the kids got no Ford car for themselves? (only their teachers?)  No. They get to pick whatever Ford car they want.       Jx223   Congrats to Scotty on winning American Idol season 10 tonight . I wish both him and Lauren well. They both seem like sweet kids.       Listening   I thought this was the first finale that was current w/ only a few sprinkles of way back when. It was kind of strange seeing the boys goof around while singing vocal wise not caring at times. Haley came off as very sweet while singing w/Tony Bennet she sort of hid any of his mistakes and was just playful w/ him she made that combination work.     Mtlfan   Lee should have been acknowledged as the reigning winner. Nigel has no class.  I’m not a Lee fan but this was the biggest disappointment of the show for me. Hey they had time for the worst singers audition and not for Lee? it’s lame btw I liked Mark Anthony performance; he’s quite a good singer. But I could have been spared of JLo ass shaking though       songsungblue   All I have to say is that it is a wonderful feeling when a kid who seems to be really likable and enthusiastic, without pretense, who isn’t afraid to show affection to his parents, friends and fellow idolettes is crowned the winner. Sometimes nice things happen to what appears to be a really nice person.  I thought that happened last year?  With the same essential lack of musical talent, too.    http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   I resemble these remarks. Jack Black is massively charismatic and Casey threw down and didn’t seem intimidated at all. Im just saying, I bet Casey totally knows the words to F*ck Her Gently, which makes two of us.    Indeed! Also noticed Jack Black jamming to the Tom Jones medley. Doubt too many celeb guests go into the audience and enjoy the rest of the show.     Swind   Haley’s vocals on the Beyonce song were so wonderful, grrrr. Really wish she would have performed her new single tonight. I really really want to download and begin falling in love with it already. As other’s said, I’m happy with a Scotty win, because it’s what I expected all season. Status quo as usual in Idol Land.     Indigobunting   I did enjoy parts of the finale- Beyonce was incredible. Gaga was entertaining (but wish they didn’t shoot her from below, lol). My favorite besides Beyonce was actually the James/Casey/Pia skit. I think Casey has a promising future in comedy. And that is why they paired him with Jack Black! I do wish they had Lee on- they definitely had room. And we didn’t need the JLo/Marc Anthony pimpage. Scotty’s sing out was about the worst that I”ve seen, in terms of winners sing outs. But nice kid, and good luck to him and Lauren.     TurkeyIdol   Adam Lambert has balls of steel. Representing the gay community on the red carpet. Good for them!!! http://i1125.photobucket.com/albums/l597/gelly414/ATOP/SUSIE.jpg      mandabutter   So the kids got no Ford car for themselves? (only their teachers?)   YES, they will get cars, too. Ryan announced they can pick whatever Ford model they want. Teachers/principal each got keys 2 a Fusion. James and JP was really mediocre for me. I would have rather listened to that Spiderman kid again. He’s a looker. Congrats Lauren and Scotty!!  I will love watching all the media rounds with these 2. Too cute. But, media, pleez cool it with the “You guys have great chemistry. Are you dating?” I seriously wanna punch somebody. I work with middle and high schoolers and look at these two as babies. Preserve the innocence! Lol.     Parkbench   This Marc performance isn’t my thing….I want to see more Stefano!!!!     believeme   Oh Haley, if you were a boy, you might be win. Naima can be sort of Paul or Casey, Thia/Pia/Karen/Ashton will be Stefano/Jacob. Lauren will be Scotty and win it. I think the coronation will never be hit on the radio. And Ashton can pretend she is Beyonce.     Mtlfan   No. They get to pick whatever Ford car they want.   Thanks Jae and mandabutter. I can’t help to think that the teachers getting car keys was a diversion to avoid Lee giving them to the finalists. lol     callmecrazy   Marc Anthony could use some Crest whitestrips.

Who would be James?  I don’t think I can listen to a girl screaming like that, don’t like the diva type of singing. Pia is out at no 9 because she is not good Nigel.     MayMirabella   BB Mom: I thought we were to refrain on this blog from bashing each other and lecturing each other. ? I respect all opinions here even those I disagree with strongly. Anyway, back to the topic of the thread, the show, I always love when the legends appear on the finale in addition to current superstars. As Tony Bennett is 85 and still sings beautifully and in all reality, many of these icons of this age or those in their 70s ..we need to appreciate them while they are here as we lose so many each year as they age. That is what I liked the best, giving credit to the Pioneers in Music, the legends.     NOLA   Was it just me or did Scotty and Lauren kiss each other on the lips? They looked like lovebirds.  Yes, they put a lip lock on each other. LOL Then a minute or so later, Lauren gave him about 4 kisses on his cheek. Too cute!     mandabutter   I can’t help to think that the teachers getting car keys was a diversion to avoid Lee giving them to the finalists. lol  Wow, I totally didn’t pick up on that…How many years running has the previous AI winner filmed a spot where they give keys to the 2 finalists?? I can only recall David C. and Kris. OMG, watching Jimmy Kimmel. He went on the streets and asked peeps to name winners of Idol based on their picture. The only one correctly named was Cook. WOW. They couldn’t identify Carrie (old pic, I’ll give em that), Kelly, Ruben, Lee, Kris, Taylor or Jordin. Jordin was called Liz. Taylor was “the old guy,” and Carrie got mistaken for Kellie Pickler. Heh.     Coldbluesteel   I thought that all the talented Southerners were purposely gotten rid of because TPTB wanted to get the rest of the country involved in S9. The ratings tanked so we got 2 country people this year. They have to find a balance that works. Next year they need a cute guy from New York against a Southern girl. Battle Royale then.     oza902   Thanks for the brilliant recap MJ! IDK why but I always enjoy reading along your recap as I watch my West Coast AI time slot.. I try not to cheat… but.. of course I did tonight. LOL I think my favorite portion of the show was the “shocking elimination” bit. Too funny!!  I’m glad Scotty won. I think he has potential to be BIG in country. Good luck to him!     Parkbench   Oh and yes Parkbench…MORE STEFANO PLEASE!  Haha! Yay! I’m glad you agree that we need more Stefano! = )     BeachBum   Who do you think wears more make-up… JLo or Adam??     jammasta   The Haley and Tony Bennett duet just told me that I have to buy Haley’s album. Amazing. Tonight was an amazing show. I even liked Lady GaGa to a degree (hated her outfit).  The James/Casey/Pia thing was hilarious. James and Judas Priest had me so excited I wanted to cry. Scotty and Tim McGraw… Beyonce, every duet and group performance… ALL AMAZING! Scotty winning was amazing too.     callmecrazy   YES MORE STEFANO….that’s my new motto. *ha* Stefano sure was working his pants tonight….hot dang. Thank goodness for video so I can watch him over and over again. If I were a smoker I may have needed a cig. *heh*    http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   Gotta see them to believe it… http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6DTjbiqzEk   Oh, wow. I had no idea who these peeps were either, as I’ve never watched X-Factor. That was entertaining for two minutes. Have they not heard of Sinead O’Connor?     Elliegrll   LLWD also got a little boost on iTunes.  It’s been there all day, probably because it’s one of the idol songs that’s on sale for .69 cents.     MayMirabella   But, media, pleez cool it with the “You guys have great chemistry. Are you dating?” I seriously wanna punch somebody. I work with middle and high schoolers and look at these two as babies. Preserve the innocence! Lol.  Yes my sister who is a high school teacher and as a former teacher myself and one who has worked with adolescents most of my career…I say let the kids be kids and enjoy their youth without questions of romance. As now should be the time for the media to ask them questions about the show, their plans for their careers and highlight their talent.     MayMirabella   Casey is funny and he handles these scripted things quite well. He may have a future as a comedy actor ala Jack Black someday. James also does this very well.     sue   Ok I am crazy but Scotty’s coronation song is catching on with me. “This big, I love you this big, this big, this big……..lol…….make it stop.” He is going to be a great role model and a country star. He sang really well with Tim McGraw tonight. I was impressed. I think he will be fine. The lyrics to the coronation song does fit Scotty to a tee even if it is cheesy. “This big, this big…….lol …..     Elliegrll   What happened to Haley singing her new song on the finale? Was that just a rumor?  I think her parents were just confused. It makes sense that UMG would have found songs for Lauren, Scotty, James, Haley and maybe even Jacob, weeks ago, so that they would have time to work on the right production. So, Haley would have performed her new song, if she had been in the final 2.     gabriel oak   Too much Jacob. I wish Paul had sung with Rod Stewart or a band and Pia had sung with anyone.     Parkbench   YES MORE STEFANO….that’s my new motto. *ha* Stefano sure was working his pants tonight….hot dang. Thank goodness for video so I can watch him over and over again. If I were a smoker I may have needed a cig. *heh*  AGREED! Him and the pants were hot…..hotter than the sun! hahaha    http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   Too much Jacob. I wish Paul had sung with Rod Stewart or a band and Pia had sung with anyone.  Like it or not, James placed higher than them so he get’s his moment on the finale. I think it’s fair to do it that way. Casey is funny and he handles these scripted things quite well. He may have a future as a comedy actor ala Jack Black someday. James also does this very well.  Thought they were both good in that skit, too. I can see Casey doing jazz in his spare time, but making it in comedy. And somehow, I can see James on Broadway, replacing Constantine in Rock of Ages. I think he must have been a theatre boi at one point. He enjoys the choreography way too much in the group numbers. LOL.     mozart4898   I confess I finally voted last night and had my first winner in 4 seasons-I was afraid to jinx Scotty as I voted for Archie,Adam and Crystal.  You think you’re bad? People I’ve voted for in AI or AGT: Clay, Crystal, Jackie Evancho, Lauren. Had I watched more seasons of AI I probably would have an even more extensive list of 2nd place finishers to add, lol.     larc   mandabutter says: Wow, I totally didn’t pick up on that…How many years running has the previous AI winner filmed a spot where they give keys to the 2 finalists?? I can only recall David C. and Kris.  Cookie gave keys to Ford Fusions to Kris and Adam. Kris did it last year for Crystal and Lee, I believe. Maybe it wasn’t done this year since Scotty and Lauren are each getting their choice of model, so there would have been no specific model to give them keys for so they could then be seen sitting in the cars. I don’t think Ford is springing for the potential extra dollars just to keep Lee out of the presentation. The company has been doing quite well recently.     callmecrazy   I hope he wears those hotpants on tour….must get tickets pronto tonto.  And I love that he is besties with James.     Mtlfan   I don’t think Ford is springing for the potential extra dollars just to keep Lee out of the presentation. The company has been doing quite well recently.  probably not but wouldn’t they do what TPTB is asking?       Parkbench   Beyonce sounds so good! And Stefano was so funny in that video segment thing. haha     mozart4898   I don’t see anything wrong with it if Lauren and Scotty happen to be dating or anything either. (And who knows if they are…they may not be at all, if you remember Crystal and Lee last year and how there was nothing there at all in the end, but I’ve wondered a few times earlier in the season about their chemistry. The kissing seemed to be a bit more than just friendship IMO.) I mean, people do sometimes end up in serious relationships in high school – my brother is married to his “high school sweetheart,” he’s 27 and they’ve been together for something like 12 years. Not saying it’s something that’d actually end up long term, but many folks that are in high school have a somewhat serious relationship at some point – so how is it not fitting for their age? I’m not one to usually say much like this or care…but I actually think it’s kinda cute, and good for them if they ARE together and are happy with each other.     panz   Very entertaining finale. Loved the Haley/Tony Bennett duet. Loved the Lauren/Carrie duet. Tom Jones and Tim McGraw. There was one Idol woman from this season who I could not identify. Weird, I thought I knew them all.     Pam   Scotty’s interview after the show: http://www.wral.com/entertainment/video/9646196/      Susan   And somehow, I can see James on Broadway, replacing Constantine in Rock of Ages. I think he must have been a theatre boi at one point. He enjoys the choreography way too much in the group numbers. LOL.   Constantine has been gone from the Broadway cast of Rock of Ages for awhile. I saw a much more age-appropriate guy in the lead role on Broadway last October. But yeah, James could totally do that role. His voice is perfect for the songs.     Susan   There was one Idol woman from this season who I could not identify. Weird, I thought I knew them all.  Ashton, probably? She went out at #13. She had long hair tonight and big hair back then.     Trina   I read an article once where James said he taught himself to dance a few years ago, he’s got good rhythm in the cheesy group numbers. And yep he does have a theatre background.  That shocking elimination video, I lost it when Pia came out with the sash LMAO.     NOLA   For those of you who haven’t heard “I Love You This Big” on iTunes, it is much much better. I love it!     Ringo   I for one am glad to see the season end. I am tired of that little girl, Charity Gomez (?) and Derek Fisher popping up everytime I move my mouse a fraction of an inch in the wrong spot on this web page. I nowfind myself tip toeing by down the edge of every screen, regardless of the web page (Google included), out of force of habit. I’m a big Laker fan, but I hate you Derek Fisher!     MayMirabella   Too much Jacob. I wish Paul had sung with Rod Stewart or a band and Pia had sung with anyone.  Jacob finished in 5th place and James in 4th so of course they will get more air time , it happens every year. I think season 8 , they did have more trios and quartets of contestants who finished lower that they did not have this year..mostly group numbers for those who finish 7th or lower is the mode most years. So I was not shocked at all.     callmecrazy   I love how they can make fun of themselves….and can look back at thier experience with idol with some humor. That happens to me as well Ringo….I do a whole lot of tiptoeing to the corner to avoid it. Made me giggle at first but then I was like UGH…. The guy singing with Bono sure looks like Jared Leto.     MayMirabella   Since Lauren turned 16 during this season of Idol, it is also possible she does not have a driver’s license yet. Scotty at 17 probably does. So Ford or Idol may not have wanted to show them getting into a car like we often see…as then there would be those hollering she does not have a license and Ford would worry about that…so to be safe ..this is how they did it.  As it is possible Lauren does not have her license yet , no sure which ages for which states but in most, it is 16 before one can even get a learners permit and she has been busy with other things like Idol and her studies while on the show.     gabriel oak   I saw Lauren kiss Scotty a few times on the cheek. But yes they kind of did look like a couple. Aw, that would be so cute. Actually, even they’re not a couple they should pretend to be. That would def sell more tour tickets.  She also kissed him on the lips. Next she’s going to have his baby, LOL.     songsungblue   I’ve been listening to clips on iTunes of the previous winner singles, and it IS entirely possible that ‘I Love You This Big’ is the worst of them. It’s neck and neck with No Boundaries. In fact, it could be the worst song I’ve ever heard. LMAO! Poor Scotty.   I would swear on a Bible from Scotty’s personal collection that he and Lauren aren’t dating at all. That kiss was Final Two Fever – it happens every time. First it was Kat and Taylor, then it was Crystal and Lee. They just spend a lot of time together and become good friends. And for the record, Lee made it very clear that he wasn’t keeping in touch with Crystal, and she married another guy within six months – that’s the way these things go.     jammasta   GODDAMMIT The Home Planet just changed their Adam Lambert site to Scotty photoshopped on Adam’s most controversial pictures such as his Rolling Stones cover! I should get credit for comparing Scotty and Adam LOL. I want Scotty to drop a fake bombshell and say Lauren is pregnant with his twins to shut up the “are they dating” crowd.     MayMirabella   I find I often forget that these teenagers have tutoring and have to be doing schoolwork for 3 hours a day. They have to forget about their songs, their idol responsibilities, rehearsals in order to do math, write papers, study history and science and so on. The tutor will give them tests and so on. It must be tough as I am sure their minds are everywhere else especially in the last couple of weeks but they have to be in school 3 hours per day no matter what else is going on. I am guessing perhaps studies finished up before Finals Week though as most schools are abou done if not done all ready.     NOLA   Scotty’s win taught us something this year: The PIMP SPOT doesn’t mean a damned thing!     panz   Thanks, Susan. I think you’re right–I didn’t recognize Ashton. Fox Chicago had a fun interview afterwards with Haley and Casey. Looking around for that. Anyone? Haley said she was thrilled to sing with Tony Bennett, who put her at ease when they were rehearsing. Also mentioned something about recording plans but I didn’t quite catch it.     MayMirabella   GODDAMMIT The Home Planet just changed their Adam Lambert site to Scotty photoshopped on Adam’s most controversial pictures such as his Rolling Stones cover!  What LOL!! Scotty and his family and his preacher will not like that..is it complete with the snake at the crotch….LOL…..     Parkbench   I hope he wears those hotpants on tour….must get tickets pronto tonto. And I love that he is besties with James.  I want to get tickets too….mainly for Stefano! and Their bromance is so cute!     MayMirabella   Scotty’s win taught us something this year: The PIMP SPOT doesn’t mean a damned thing!  And the Kristy Lee Cook curse has been defeated. !!!! That is major..LOL!!!  Now to break the Alphabet thing where the winner’s first or last name is last in the alphabet.. as each season that works for first names and in the David Seasons..first letter of last name..it worked..this year same thing.  Soon the new curse to break is for a girl to ever win Idol again…no teen boys or good looking guys next year judges..LOL     Susan   The guy singing with Bono sure looks like Jared Leto.  The guy singing with Bono was a cutie!     Parkbench   Steven was amazing!!!! I loved the orchestra arrangement.     larc   NOLA says: Scotty’s win taught us something this year: The PIMP SPOT doesn’t mean a damned thing!  True, he never had it even once. Probably the only winner so far who didn’t. But Idol likely didn’t give it to him because they knew how the votes were running and thought he didn’t need it.     Jae   M ayMirabella says: 05/26/2011 at 12:56 am Scotty’s win taught us something this year: The PIMP SPOT doesn’t mean a damned thing! He never had it and let Lauren sing second so go figure!     easyrider707   Nice show. I liked all 6 guys this year and Lauren. I thought the less heralded girls (Karen, Thia, Naima, and especially Ashton) had a really nice night. Congrats to Scotty. Very nice to see a champion that folks voted for because they like him. Should translate well into sales.  I felt the last couple of years folks have voted against a front runner as oppossed to voting for a favorite (I.e. voted against Adam and Crystal more than voted for Kris or Lee. The one thing America loves is to hate.    http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   I would swear on a Bible from Scotty’s personal collection that he and Lauren aren’t dating at all. That kiss was Final Two Fever – it happens every time. First it was Kat and Taylor, then it was Crystal and Lee. They just spend a lot of time together and become good friends. And for the record, Lee made it very clear that he wasn’t keeping in touch with Crystal, and she married another guy within six months – that’s the way these things go.  Agreed. People ship contestants every year. I think back in Season 4 it was Carrie and Anthoney.. Canthony! It may go back even farther, but it happens every year. Let’s see… this year we’ve had Casey and Haley; Pia and Stefano; and now Scotty and Lauren. LOL.     HighOnElliott   Dayum! Two Dudes who will always be the coolest….. Tony Bennett and Tom Jones. They still got it! And Haley Haley Haley girl was AWESOME with Tony. I could’ve watched a whole concert of just the two of ‘em. Fantastic. Someday, I need that girl to make a Jazz album…. Wow, Beyonce killed it on 1+1. And seriously hot Latin with Marc, Sheila E! and JLo…. So many stellar performances tonight, and they didn’t involve lip-syncing. How refreshing. Sure beats the crap out of the Billboard awards. This is some of the best entertainment we’ve seen on TV in a very long time. Truly one of the best Idol finales ever.    http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   The one thing America loves is to hate.  I disagree with this. You can’t vote against someone…. you can only vote for others. And other than voting a couple of times, I can’t see anyone wasting their time in that way.     Parkbench   Haha! When Scotty was hugging his family, Jack Black reached out for a hug and didn’t get one!     yellin   I am thinking the boys or James (looks like he says “james” in the video) were supposed to join Steven, but maybe they ran out of time? Something was “off” or too short about it. I know you will get to the bottom of it MJ…lol:) Congrats to Scotty and Lauren both.       ross   So the kids got no Ford car for themselves? (only their teachers?)  YES, they will get cars, too. Ryan announced they can pick whatever Ford model they want. Teachers/principal each got keys 2 a Fusion.  The teachers each got keys to a Focus. I didn’t really need to see the individual “guest” performances. Usually, the guest stars perform with the idols, don’t they? I would rather have seen the entire Top 10 do duets than to see this other stuff that took focus away from the idols.     jammasta   I think back in Season 4 it was Carrie and Anthoney.. Canthony!  Durfano, Kradam, Mavid, the Haley/Pia/Stefano triangle (I have no idea if this was really shipped), Siobhan+Lee…. THE COUPLES ARE ENDLESS!     eyin   One thing that I really noticed is that Thia moves very comfortably on stage, something we never really got to see her do. I don’t think she’ll be a bore on tour. Congrats Scotty.     easyrider707   Evidently you skipped reading the blogs in S8 and S9 or the talk. Refreshing this year to not see this toward any contestant. Also, you can vote against someone very easily hundreds of times in the finale by just voting for the other person, even if you are not a big fan and have no plans on buying songs.     believeme   Every time I heard Stefano, I always wonder how he can be Top 7. He should be banned from doing the falsetto. At least I can listen Jacob if he doesn’t scream. I like Kelvin Covias’ Pussy Cat than James’. The girls’ medley really outstanding compared to boys.    http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   Haley/Pia/Stefano triangle  ?? I thought there were rumors of Pia and Stefano, but how was Haley supposedly involved. LOL.    http://twitter.com/cara_lee  pj   Every time I heard Stefano, I always wonder how he can be Top 7. He should be banned from doing the falsetto. At least I can listen Jacob if he doesn’t scream.  Agreed. Worst part of the Tom Jones medley. Luckily, he went first.     YeahRight   mandabutter says: Yippee! Color me excited. I’m looking forward to the tour. All the guys seem to have a genuine friendship. We shall see.  All the guys minus Jacob. I don’t think Scott hugged him at the end there when he was hugging everybody else.     jammasta   ?? I thought there were rumors of Pia and Stefano, but how was Haley supposedly involved. LOL.  I remembered there being some Haley/Pia drama brought up in some comments about the Pia/Stefano thing. While likely a rumor/false/etc., someone still said it  .     Niall   Color me shocked, but that was one entertaining finale. The only complaint I would really have is the lack of screentime overall for Scotty and Lauren. It was easy to forget at times what the actual purpose of the show was. Haley upped her stock tonight. She came across like a star, even moreso than Pia. Scotty and Lauren are two nice kids and I wish them well, even though neither is my cup of tea. I feel bad for them though because I’m sure after the innocent kisses they exchanged,the mouth breathers and basement dwellers of idol fandom are hard at work on squicky fan fic involving two MINORS.     Kirsten   Best. Finale. EVER! Certainly the one with the best production values. Welcome back, Nigel, you evil twerp. You do know how to put on a good show. All the fossils they found to sing with the kids seemed thrilled to be there and sang on key (remember Chicago last year? No? You’re lucky).  Everybody got their moment to shine (remember those years when everybody but a select few were just glorified back-up singers for like 30 seconds? Yep. It sucked). The pointy pose dancing actually was dancing. Usually it’s just clump-clump, hit the mark, clump-clump. I’m not saying they are ready for SYTYCD, but there were some actual choreography going on there tonight. Great lighting. Sound techs were not completely useless. They sobered up the camera guys from last night. And the director hit his stride. Lots of good use of humour. Some great songs. Some fantastic outfits. Poor Lauren must have really burnt out her vocal chords since she skipped the two girl’s group numbers. I hope she’s okay and they didn’t push her too hard.  If I had a bone to pick, they shouldn’t have back-loaded all those stars who didn’t want to sing with the Idols. They should have been more sprinkled throughout the show like they were in S6. I know that they all wanted to the big ratings of the last half hour, but tell them they have to settle for 23M viewers instead of 23.5M or they can find another show to pimp their wears on. I always feel a little sorry for the final two on the big results show because it’s obvious they’ve been worn thin by all the other stuff they have to get done to actually win the show. Typically, their voices are shot and they have had the least amount of time to practice the group numbers. Yay! Scotty won! And man, during that sing-out, you could see just how much a kid he still is. Sometimes, he’s so composed and confident, I forget. Jimmy might not be happy that he didn’t do more to sing the song, but it was a nice moment. Sometimes you have to forget about making hay and just enjoy the flowers.    http://twitter.com/lindsav  adamland   And somehow, I can see James on Broadway, replacing Constantine in Rock of Ages. I think he must have been a theatre boi at one point. He enjoys the choreography way too much in the group numbers. LOL.  In 2006 & 2008, James performed in a Santa Cruz children’s theater group called Kids on Broadway and played the lead role in Beauty and the Beast and Singin’ in the Rain. Tony in West Side Story and Oscar in Sweet Charity. In 2008, James appeared in Alan Parsons’ “Art & Science of Sound Recording” educational video series, recording a version of Parsons’ “We Play The Game” at Ex’pression College for Digital Arts. So yeah he has to love those group numbers.     Nativenewyorker   Congratulations to Scotty, our new American Idol! Also congratulations to Lauren, our runnerup and the other Idols who brought so much joy with all their talent and great performances this season! This is the first time my favorite has won since Ruben Studdard in season two!  The world didn’t end and I fell for a country music singer! WOW!! This has been one crazy ride and I have loved every minute of it. I had tears in my eyes watching Scotty’s reaction when he won. Everyone may have thought that Scotty had this wrapped up a long time ago, but they forgot to tell Scotty! His reaction was so great to see. He truly is a humble, sweet young man who just was born with this amazing voice. I loved seeing him finally have his chance to go hug his parents and family while he tried to get through his song.  I think it said a lot that Scotty shared his special moment with the other contestants, telling James – I love you, man. James told him to go win it when he was voted off. Then he hugged Casey and sang his name and all the others, Stefano, Haley, Thia, Karen and Pia. I didn’t see him hug Jacob. Lauren couldn’t stop kissing him.  I thought Scotty cleared it all up earlier in the season when Ryan asked what was going on with Lauren. He said, brother and sister. So that is what I have to think it is between them – a close friendship and bond that they formed while they went through this journey together. What a great show! Loved it! I am so happy for Scotty! This is the kid that got me to listen to country music! The people who know me will never get over it!   A final thanks to mj for providing this place where we all come to share our thoughts every season, the hard work, putting up the videos, all the info, everything. You are great!       HighOnElliott   A final thanks to mj for providing this place where we all come to share our thoughts every season, the hard work, putting up the videos, all the info, everything. You are great!  Cheers to you MJ!     abbysee   The PIMP SPOT doesn’t mean a damned thing!  That only applies when your name is Scotty McCreery! I feel bad for them though because I’m sure after the innocent kisses they exchanged,the mouth breathers and basement dwellers of idol fandom are hard at work on squicky fan fic involving two MINORS.  Cause kissing for teens is all squicky and everything, lol. Seriously, it’s not like people are saying they are doing the nasty! (TM Jacob Lusk) Yay! Scotty won! And man, during that sing-out, you could see just how much a kid he still is. Sometimes, he’s so composed and confident, I forget. Jimmy might not be happy that he didn’t do more to sing the song, but it was a nice moment. Sometimes you have to forget about making hay and just enjoy the flowers.  It’s been a pleasure rooting for the same horse, a pleasure, lol! I enjoyed the sing out because he let the veil slip a bit and was just a kid, and it was heartwarming. I adore this kid and want only the best for him, whatever that may be. I’ve enjoyed watching this season and his journey!     abbysee   This is the first time my favorite has won since Ruben Studdard in season two!  Whoa, another Ruben fan on MJ’s yay! Oh yes, thanks MJ. For hosting this yearly party. I love this place, even when I don’t, lol. It’s been a blast as always. You have a great group of music lovers here. Can’t wait for the next season! Cheers to you, and Kirsten as well, I’ve enjoyed alot of her content as well!     Eileen99   LOVED the finale. It was really, really great and so entertaining. LOL that I thought Gaga was the least entertaining of the night (she’s so predictable now). They did a great job booking the acts to appear on the show & the pairings were great. Scotty & Lauren were adorable together, and it was nice seeing Scotty break down and act his age. We’re so used to seeing him so cool & collected all the time. And all Lauren’s kisses. So sweet.  I was smiling all night, and still am. Very happy with the results, and so looking forward to seeing what happens with these two.     idolfan92   A final thanks to mj for providing this place where we all come to share our thoughts every season, the hard work, putting up the videos, all the info, everything. You are great!  I second this!     Q3   A very different finale. I was really pleasantly surprised by the high level of the production values and overall quality of the performances.  There was no time wasted on silliness like Kara in a bikini or Pants on the Ground, instead there was a pretty entertaining shocking book bit. There of my favorite performances were the first three men James + Judas Priest, Jacob + Kirk Franklin and Gladys Knight, and Casey + Jack Black. Since James, Jacob and Casey were not on my fav list, this was a pleasant surprise. Liked lots of other parts of the show. My only problems were that 5 numbers without any Idols which seemed a bit much to me — although I guess are expect to drive ratings. And no time for Lee. Couldn’t they have had him give the Ford keys to Lauren and Scotty after they gave the Teachers their keys. It would have only required cutting 15 secs of J.Lo. “dance”.     Ringo   I thought Scotty cleared it all up earlier in the season when Ryan asked what was going on with Lauren. He said, brother and sister.  I guess the whole Southern tradition of kissin’ cousins has slipped everyone else’s mind?     abbysee   Scotty McCreery IS this year’s American Idol. I can’t even believe it! I am overwhelmed with joy! Congratulations!  Okay, I am post whoring now, but this is exactly how I feel. I am so glad for him. I must admit I started voting for him because even though I acknowledge that he is low key. His singing touched something in me, and even though I didn’t expect it, I just went with it, and voila, he’s season 10′s American Idol. Amazeballs! ETA: Kudos to Lauren Alaina, who acquitted herself with panache tonight. She was so happy for him, and that was such a joy to behold. Say what you will about these two, but their parents raised some great kids.     Kirsten   Time to hand out the awards: Best Outfit of the Night: Haley’s duet dress. That thing is gorgeous and she looked absolutely freakin’ amazing.  Guest who Most Looked Like an Escapee From Fargo : Mark Anthony. Is it me, or could he play Steve Buscemi’s brother? I hope Nigel hid all the woodchippers. Best Outcome from a Failed Single : Lady Gaga. Lately, Gaga has not known that less is sometimes more. Everything is stupidly driven to extremes. She was supposed to sing Judas on this show, but that song flopped harder than a 6-week old dead fish. One massive, over-the-top production number in the dustbin. So, they quickly cobbled together a paper mache cliff and told her just to stand on the top because there was no time to learn new choreography. Finally, she just sang. And then cooly fell off the cliff (just like her song Judas did). Woo! Best Sport: James. Seriously, he sang the pussycat song and made fun of his shock boot. I like him. Best Reason to Listen to Your Vocal Coach: Judas Priest. Did the lead singer always sound like a bunch of gravel in a washing machine because that is one seriously shot voice.  Most Enthusiastic Guest : Kirk Franklin. That guy was everywhere and having the time of his life. Tough not to smile Most in Awe of His Guest Duet Partner: Scotty. You could just tell how he couldn’t believe he was getting to sing with Tim McGraw. You could practically see himself pinching himself.  Person Most Earnest About the Dance Sessions: Stefano. He was determined to work it. Person who Missed Most of the Dance Sessions:  Scotty. He was totally checking out what the other guys were doing. That’s the trouble with going to school and having to compete in the finale. Person who Most Dances to their own Drum: Paul, James and Casey. Motto: Just have fun and people will enjoy it. And I did. Best Duet: I loved them all. Everybody was having a blast. I sound just like Steven. Do you think Nigel will pay me millions of dollars to be a judge next year?  Best Jacket: Spider man dude’s. Totally a throwback to the 80s and I’d feel like an idiot wearing it, but strangely, I covet it. What a fun night. What a fun crew.     girlygirl   I was at the finale show tonight. What an amazing production! This is the 2nd straight year I’ve been to the results show, and this one totally kick the S9 results’ show butt  . The actual result was very anticlimatic, but the performances ranged from solid to amazing. It was so much fun just to be there. My favorite moments were the Top 13 girls singing with Beyonce, seeing the 2 remaining members of TLC perform, and the Casey/Jack Black duet. But there really wasn’t a bad performance in the bunch. The only thing I was upset about was the fact they didn’t even let Lee do the ceremonial “hand the car keys to the Top 2″ moment. Meanwhile, Kris & Katy were sitting right behind Adam & Sauli. Some of my friends had a good view of them from their seats, and they said that Kris & Adam were talking to each other during every commercial break, and that they were swarmed by other idols nd random people. Here’s a photo — sort of like where’s Waldo. see if you can spot the 4 of them   http://twitpic.com/52k3jx      girlygirl   Weird random note – people seem to be confusing the Tim McGraw’s song with Kris’s singlie — because LLWD is at #230 on itunes! hey, I’m sure Kris appreciates the extra money       eyin   Also, I know we’ve seen a Lauren and Scotty duet three times already, but man I missed the traditional Top 2 duet on finale night. I was actually waiting for it. I still think Season 3 had the best Finalists’ Pointy Pose.     McCreerian   I’M SO EXCITED FOR SCOTTY!!!! HE DESERVED IT! Ok I will calm down. But just think, he went from people doubting him with “babylockthemdoors” and “nuts of wonder” to winning this whole thing!     Kirsten   I was at the finale show tonight.  Me = Jellus H8ter What an amazing production! This is the 2nd straight year I’ve been to the results show, and this one totally kick the S9 results’ show butt  Kicked it’s butt, threw it out the door and turned out the light.  Woo.  Anyway, I do have a question. Were any of the production numbers shot before the show? That string of non-Idol performances seemed to feature some serious set-pieces and I’m not sure they could have put them all up and broken them down during the commercial breaks (granted, the commercial breaks were long enough). And at some point they would have had to have extracted Spiderman from the rafters. What a fun night. The girls were amazeballs in their group number with Beyonce (is there nothing Haley can’t sing?), the guys group number was SO much fun. I can’t think of a bad duet.     CCOREY2034   I am so glad Scotty won and he totally deserved it. All that Lauren pimping all season and IMO she didn’t deserve the title.  OMG my favorite moment of the night was Haley-Tony. OMG she is just amazing. We have another Haley moment to add to her many moments. I honestly cannot get enough of this girl and I would buy anything from her. Did anyone notice how much better Haley is over Pia as well? Does anyone see a future for Haley Reinhart? I just love her to death. Again she delivers. She only has given us some of the biggest moments of season 10. What contestant gave you the biggest moments?     McCreerian   Any word on how the after party is going/went? I’m sure there are a ton of people there. Any idol alumni who made it?     MayMirabella   All the guys minus Jacob. I don’t think Scott hugged him at the end there when he was hugging everybody else.  Scotty was just being rushed through and it was getting crowded as the judges got there just as he was about to hug Jacob. I am sure it happened later. As I think they all get along as remember Jacob was the first one to hug Casey when he got saved that night and recovered from the shock..backstage and Jacob was always there hugging everyone along with the rest, I think they all get along well.     shadow21   I just wanted to come in here and say thanks to you MJ! If it wasn’t for you, there would be countless times I would have to find videos of the performances or the show.  I really came in here as a long time supporter and viewer of your blog. Keep doing what your doing! You deserve a lot of credit for this blog! BTW…..loved the finale for the performances…but moving onto next year! Scotty winning was VERY expected! We all knew it. I just hope next year a female can FINALLY win!     weelassie   Just think how many groups turned the country boy away when they were assembling their groups and he won the whole shebang. too funny. I had no idea Adam was so much taller than Sauli.     Niall   Cause kissing for teens is all squicky and everything, lol. Seriously, it’s not like people are saying they are doing the nasty!  Don’t bet on it.     McCreerian   Any record deal news for the final 2 yet? I want to know which labels they are getting signed to!     weelassie   Looking at the red carpet shots, geez, we could have a group number of Archie, Cookie, Adam, Kris, Lee, Blake, Chris, Tim, Jason, Allison, and more i can’t remember right now.lol. and Mary Murphy and Mark K could have danced during the number.     YeahRight   gabriel oak says: Too much Jacob. I wish Paul had sung with Rod Stewart or a band and Pia had sung with anyone.  Too much Jacob? He had his spotlight performance with Gladys Knight and Kirk Franklin and his solo in the Tom Jones medley. Did I miss anything else? He came in 5th. I know the producers hated him, but they had to give him his spotlight performance. And I still think Scott dissed him at the end. He didn’t hug him when he was hugging everybody else. The girls were amazeballs in their group number with Beyonce (is there nothing Haley can’t sing?)  Yeah, Beyonce. I thought she sounded horrible.     webster   Overall, a fun season, and a large part of that was this place, so thanks to MJ and the rest of the community. But I found the finale to be a snooze. I hung in for the first hour, but all of the music numbers (and of course, all the cheezie bits) just felt incredibly tedious, so I turned it off. Even Haley and Casey’s numbers were disappointing. But, it’s been an exhausting work week, so maybe it just wasn’t a good night to be watching tv. I hops idol does a good job of thinking about what new things worked and what didn’t. I really hope they return to judging the voting rounds.     McCreerian   Assuming they are all back next year, I think the judges will improve a lot. Kara was horrible in Season 8, but in Season 9 she was actually the most constructive judge and had the best advice.    http://twitter.com/lindsav  adamland   I had no idea Adam was so much taller than Sauli.  LOL he’s taller but his wedge boots add about 3 inches to his height plus another 3 for the hair.     Nativenewyorker   I guess the whole Southern tradition of kissin’ cousins has slipped everyone else’s mind?  Ringo, Okay, you got me with that one!       MayMirabella   The biggest change that needs to be made is for the judges to not be afraid to be a little tougher and not be so afraid that the contestants may cry or get upset. If someone is going to have a career in the music business, it is not an easy road and filled with tough critiques. The judges do them no favors taking it too easy on them. I think Randy did get tough on a couple of them but overall, it was only 2 or 3 all season and he was inconsistent. When Simon was there, Randy was tougher and said a lot of ..Dawg that was not good or just aiight.He did not even say..Just Aiight to any performance of some of them all season. It is like Randy mirrors the attitude of the other guy on the panel, Steven praises them all so Randy is more mild than ever before when he was with Simon. It was like Simon made it ok for Randy to get tougher orsomething ?  I hope Nigel tells the judges to speak their minds and not be so easy on the contestants.     MayMirabella   Adam is 6’1″ and remember how he towered over Kris? And add that new hairstyle and boots..and he gained another 3 inches .     Niall   What was also interesting to me was that while I did think Lee should have been allowed to perform just based on the fact that he was last year’s winner, his impact on me and probably most of America has been so minimal that I forgot about him entirely until a few minutes ago, when I said to myself “oh yeah, that’s right. Lee wasn’t allowed to perform.” It’s like he never happened, which was probably Nigel’s goal.     MayMirabella   I think Randy will be on the show for as long as it lasts. He will be known as the only original judge and I am sure he makes a boatload of money and gets offered huge raises to stay just because he like Ryan have been there for all 10 years. I wish he would leave and Simon would offer him a job but it would be judging with he and Paula and we would have original idol panel on XFactor. Who knows, Simon and Randy are very close friends so maybe someday it will happen.  I have doubts that Steven will stay for more than 2-3 years if that. As he may want to get back on the road touring and it would interfere with auditions and Idol…as with auditions later in the summer and fall and Hollywood week and such..he almost has to do a tour on off months ..or right after Idol and schedule it all around auditions.  Jennifer Lopez is probably loving this as her videos and songs can be seen by a wide audience and Mark also is getting a lot of PR. I am not a JLO fan but I think she is there to stay as the show acts like it was a huge , huge thing to get her and if paid well enough, she will stay. Paula left because Simon and Randy were getting considerably better raises and Ryan too, So I see this same bunch for a couple of years until contract negotiations break down or Simon tries to nab one or two of them for X Factor or another show and pays them better. Plus she can be home with her kids more often instead of out on the road touring and performing all over the world.     Dlynne   It was an entertaining show. I think my favorite performance was James’. It was such an awesome moment for him. He looked so happy. My least favorite performance was the boys’, and not because they didn’t sing well but because I was all WTF with Tom Jones. He was a strange choice for that group. Haley really deserves the props tonight, too. The girl can really sing anything. No wonder she never let them put her in a box by making her pick a genre and stick with it. I’ll definitely check out any music she releases. I do wish that Lee had been given an acknowledgement. It’s really no fun as a fan to see one of your favorites tossed aside like that. He deserved better. A final thanks to mj for providing this place where we all come to share our thoughts every season, the hard work, putting up the videos, all the info, everything. You are great!  And lastly, this ^. I couldn’t have said it better. Thank you, MJ!     MayMirabella   And the only reason Carrie performed and no other past idols did was directly to Lauren being a finalist. It used to be past Idols performed a group number ..I recall Kelly, Reuben, Fantasia performing a number on Season 4 Finale. I think Nigel is getting away from that with past idols and past idol contestants and insteads features them on Results night throughout the season. I think Finale is reserved now for big name acts or acts that can perform duets with the top 6 or group numbers or hugely successful current artists perforning alone ala Bono and GaGa.     Trina   Not only was it crappy Lee didn’t get to perform but they shoved him in what looked like the 6th row and Ryan completely ignored him. Really cold.     jammasta   So I’ve had 3 favorites win! Ruben, Kris, and Scotty. If you count my picks from the final 2, 4 or 5 winners (Taylor and Kelly, but I didn’t watch Kelly’s season enough).  Question is, who is my favorite winner, Scotty or Kris? I think just because he’s more recent, Scotty has the slight edge.  1. Scotty McCreery 2. Kris Allen 3. Kelly Clarkson 4. David Cook 5. Carrie Underwood 6. Jordin Sparks 7. Ruben Studdard 8. Fantasia Barrino 9. Taylor Hicks 10. Lee DeWyze That’s how I’d rank the winners in my personal opinion. I don’t HATE Lee, though, he’s just the weakest winner (and I feel terrible for him being snubbed horribly… At least he had a second to talk on my local news!)  I found Adam and…. Sauli? in the picture, but I could barely see Kris and Katy.  Jason Castro, Stefano Langone, James Durbin, Kris Allen, David Cook, and a few others who were at the red carpet event shouted out to Sacramento on my local news! Woo hoo! Someone also showed Scotty a news reporter who apparently resembled him and Scotty laughed  .     MayMirabella   Not only was it crappy Lee didn’t get to perform but they shoved him in what looked like the 6th row and Ryan completely ignored him. Really cold.  True as there were a couple of times tonight when Ryan had to wait for the next act to set up and he could have walked back to Lee and asked the audience to acknowledge last year’s Idol.     MayMirabella   I do think what the show should do briefly on Finale night, if nothing else, is ask all Idol winners to stand up in the audience and take a bow. It takes all of 20 seconds or much less.     McCreerian   The last 4 winners should be thanking this girl here: http://static.thehollywoodgossip.com/images/gallery/kristy-lee-cook-photo.jpg  LOL     Montavilla   What they could do is acknowledge one past winner as they go to commercial break. That wouldn’t take more than a few seconds at a time and it would be interesting.  It’s really a shame not to have the most recent winner perform. I suppose Lee doesn’t have anything to plug, but I’m sure he hasn’t forgotten all his songs. I was trying to think what I wouldn’t mind losing in order to accommodate a Lee performance. I enjoyed the spectacle of the Spiderman song, but it had nothing at all to do with AI. So, that’s the one I would have cut.  But I guess that current Idol has no reason to plug past Idol winners, since none of them are signed to UMG.     tomk   Can’t really compare Haley to Pia…it would be liking comparing an artist like Alanis to Christina Aguilera; just two totally different genres of music and two completely different fanbases that they will try to appeal to. There’s room for both of them. I do think Pia needs to break out of her “stage shell” (judging by interviews and what not, she is very likeable – but she just hasn’t been able to bust it out on the stage). In that way, she does need to develop a bit of Haley’s “Kick A**” type of attitude when performing.     CCOREY2034   Season 10 was a good season overall, it wasn’t great ala a season 5 or season 7 but much improved from season 9. It had such great talent this season. Actually the finale made up for last nights dreck of a final show. Honestly the thing is we need more judging next year. Honestly Randy is locked in for next year, so is Steven Tyler but the big question will Jennifer Lopez renew her contract? She said shes going to be on tour with her new album. I bet she doesn’t return for season 11 but the thing is she is replacable IMO. It just finding the right person.     Lisa   ‘American Idol’ castoffs steal the show http://tinyurl.com/3ta44gk      music woman   My favorite moment tonight (besides James and Judas Priest) was when Ryan was sitting at the judges’ table and went to announced Casey Abrams and announced CASEY JAMES! LOL! Yeahhhh! (yes I am a Casey James fan)    http://www.fatladysings.us  TFLS   Happy, happy, joy joy! I got my Mark Kanemura fix – so s’all good as far as I’m concerned.

Everybody else     chrislongisland   As for the judges, I would love to see the self-aggrandizing jealous JLO leave.     samgamgee   Okay, so let me post my ranking as well. lol 1.

Kelly Clarkson 2. Carrie Underwood 8-10. Everybody else  My personal rankings of the winners: 1. Carrie Underwood 2-10. Don’t really care for the rest     shuey   THANK GOD THIS CRAP YEAR IS OVER  YEEHAA     TLKC   It was interesting to watch a finale where I didn’t care/probably knew who would win. Much more relaxed and enjoyable. I can see how people who normally don’t watch the show could tune in and have a nice time. Favourite funnies: Jack Black and Casey singing Fat Bottomed Girls; Jack Black joining the row of Scotty’s family for a hug at the end and not getting one. Least entertaining: Spiderman (though Spidey had an incredible voice and was very cute.) And the Tom Jones medley until the man himself showed up and reminded everybody how well those songs can be sung. Nice to see Lee placed for maximum visibility throughout the evening and I hope he was seated there for that purpose. Wish they had kept him in the line-up but no David Cook performance either (and he has a new single.) MAJOR EPIPHANY: during Hayley’s performance with Tony Bennet it hit me: she sounds like Billie Holliday! I pulled out my BH vinyl and played “No Regrets” – holy cow! I am definitely going to see her if she comes to town and am downloading some of her songs on iTunes this morning. I have NEVER downloaded a contestant’s Idol songs before. She has a solid career IMHO; may not be filling stadiums or topping charts but she is going places.     abl890   http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/idol-worship/american-idol-cast-pia-toscano-192453  Looks like Pia, Scotty, and Lauren may all be with Interscope.     fuzzywuzzy   I thought that the finale was entertaining, even though it was a giant promotion-fest for the established stars who appeared. Scotty seems like a really nice guy, and although I’m not a fan of his singing, I hope that he does well. He’s carried himself really well throughout the competition. Lauren has a lot of potential and held up well last night too. I think that her duet with Carrie would have been a real show stopping moment, if she were in full voice. Nice that Scotty and Lauren appear to be friends. I haven’t read the latest posts on this thread, but if people are posting their rankings of favorite AI winners, then here’s mine: 1. Kelly 2. Cook 3. Carrie 4-9. the rest in no particular order  10. Lee     Valentin432   Apart from the single tracks, the albums are charting too: Albums: 4. American Idol Season 10: Scotty McCreery – Scotty McCreery 8. American Idol Season 10: Lauren Alaina – Lauren Alaina     Incipit   Thanks mj for providing web space here – and thanks everybody for posting in this entertaining thread! Really, a fun read this morning. Wicked nasty wind storms = no internet last night – but I already knew who was going to win – and mj has videos for later, if I care to look, so it’s all good. Tony Bennet and Haley sounds intriguing – skipping the ‘Big’ also sounds like a plan. *wink*     TLKC   Adam Lambert has balls of steel. Representing the gay community on the red carpet. Good for them!!! http://i1125.photobucket.com/albums/l597/gelly414/ATOP/SUSIE.jpg   Thanks for this wonderful picture, TurkeyIdol. Gorgeous and inspiring.     kvwicks13   Here are my personal rankings: 1. Lee 2. David 3. Kelly 4. Carrie 5. Scotty 6. Kris 7. Jordan 8. Rubin 9 Taylor 10 Fantasia     kmd   James and Casey’s performances were the best. They were great. Haley was good with Tony Bennett too. It was a good and entertaining show but I don’t think it matters who wins it. They did not even mention past idol winners last night except for Carrie.     TLKC   Oh MJ, forgot to say, THANKS for providing such excellent on-the-spot coverage of Idol, not just tonight but year-in, year-out. You have created a truly wonderful meeting place for us Idol nutters to share our thoughts, even disagree, without too much !*&%!*. Can’t imagine watching Idol without at least lurking on this blog. You add some really awesome sauce to the main meal.     Esqt   Love this year’s finale! I like that there were more current & relevant guests, mostly visual performers. Hands down to the castoffs. They stole the show, for me. Beyonce w/ the girls were amazing – Pia, Karen, & Thia especially. The pageant girl who was consistently on pitch & danced on rhythm in EVERY group poses during the idol run was noticed & given more face time…finally. The “shocking elimination” skit was a hoot. I rewatched it aaa many times & Pia’s appearance at the end still cracks me up everytime.     theonlygirl   Love seeing Adam on the red carpet holding hands with his boyfriend. He radiates so much love at this moment, it’s so nice to see. I’m so happy for him, he has wanted this for a long time. I watched bits and pieces of the finale. (thankyou for the vids mj!) and while I didnt watch the idols performing ( I dont care ), I loved Beyonce’s medley with the girls, and her ballad, and even Gaga’s performance. I used to love her, but now my love has dumbed down to like, and i have to say Beyonce wiped the floor with her to be honest. That woman is flawless. I also loved Marc Antony’s performance. I know he only got the spot because of his wife, but damn, he is one GREAT salsa performer, and salsa is awesome!     luly   I only saw parts of the final, but it looked fun  . Congrats Scotty!     Lucy1234   My Idol Winner rankings 1. Carrie 2. Kellie 3. Cook Don’t care for any of the rest  Ranking of seasons: Season 1 (loved Justin and Kelly and was hooked from then on) Season 4 Carrie, Bo and Constantine Season 8 Danny and Adam but mostly Danny Season 10 – Lauren, James, Pia, Paul were my favs Season 7 Cook fan for that year Season 5 Liked Daughtry but didn’t like Taylor or I would have had the season higher. Season 2 – no favorite that year still riding high with Justin and Kelly Season 3 and 6 and 9 were my least favorites.    http://www.dancin.ca  dancin   very nice kids both lauren and scotty (classy sing out) and i’m happy for them both   ai 10 over n out!!     abbysee   I know he only got the spot because of his wife, but damn, he is one GREAT salsa performer, and salsa is awesome!  That was one of my favorite moments. I love Marc, he’s an incredible singer, and an awesome performance. Ms. Escovedo was just icing on a very nice cake. Since we are ranking our favorite idols winners Kelly Ruben Fantasia Taylor Scotty or Cookie Jordin Carrie Kris Lee Now if you throw in some also rans that would change things entirely except for the first three probably.     chrislongisland   Here’s my favorite contestant, season by season: Season 1: Kelly Clarkson (winner) Season 2: Kim Locke (3rd place) Season 3: Jennifer Hudson (7th place) Season 4: Carrie Underwood (winner) Season 5: Kellie Pickler (5th place) Season 6: Jordin Sparks (winner) Season 7: Brooke White (5th place) Season 8: Adam Lambert (2nd place) Season 9: Crystal Bowersox (2nd place) Season 10: Haley Reinhart (3rd place)     Jon   I gotta say DAMN. Haley looks hot in those photos. I really did enjoyed most of the finale. I knew that Haley wasn’t going to perform her single. Wish her all the best for her future post-idol career. Definitely supporting her.  Congrats to Scotty for winning. He won this thing since day 1. I do believe he won this mostly with his chrisma and likability than his actual talent. Really curious how he’ll do. If Danny Gokey can have a decent carrer in country, then Scotty gotta be the most successful country star since Carrie. Also wanted to add an interview with Casey and Haley last night that really showed their chemistry. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHc6C7hdA0U&feature=player_embedded      steph6449   dizzyfeet: I was so upset Lee DeWyze wouldn’t present the winners trophy to Scotty. Especially as he’d been on the show this Season. I guess he was shy  Eeps. If that’s real, then sounds like something is definitely going on behind the scenes. If it’s a joke, I’m no Lee fan but it’s a pretty tasteless and gratuitous one.    http://www.twilightslo.com  Mateja   My personal rankings of the winners: 1. Kelly Clarkson 2. Jordin Sparks 3. Carrie Underwood 4. Scotty McCreery 5. David Cook 6. Fantasia 7. Ruben Studdard 8. Taylor Hicks 9. Kris Allen 10. Lee DeWyze Kelly is my favorite winner. I also love Jordin and Carrie. Both are great singers, but I like pop/rnb music more than country, so Jordin beats Carrie. Scotty is in 4th place for me, at least for now. Country is not my favorite genre, but when Scotty is good, he’s very very good. If Lauren won, I would also put her right behind Carrie for now, but I like Lauren more than Scotty, so she would be a bit closer to Carrie.  David Cook, Fantasia and Ruben Studdard are in the middle for me. I think they are all decent singers and recording artists and all put out some good material, but they don’t appeal to me as much as the first 4.  Taylor Hicks can be decent as a singer/performer, but his material does nothing for me. Kris Allen and Lee DeWyze just do it for me as singers. My favorite contestants over the years: Season 1: Kelly Clarkson (winner), followed by Tamyra Gray (4th) Season 2: Clay Aiken (2nd place) – based on live performances on the show from the videos I’ve seen Season 3: Jennifer Hudson (7th place) Season 4: Carrie Underwood (winner) Season 5: Chris Daughtry (4th place), I also like Kellie Pickler (6th) Season 6: Jordin Sparks (winner) Season 7: David Archuleta (2nd place) Season 8: Adam Lambert (2nd place), also loved Allison Iraheta (4th) Season 9: Umm, I guess Michael Lynche (4th), because he gave several good performances in a pretty bad season. Season 10: Haley Reinhart (3rd place), followed by Lauren Alaina (2nd) and Scotty McCreery (winner)     jing_ftw   Marc Anthony + Hector Lavoe’s classic + Sheila E + JLo’s Sexy Expressive and Salsa Dance = CRAZY EFFIN GOOD STUFF!!! GOOSEBUMPS!!!     Valentin432   I recall Kelly, Reuben, Fantasia performing a number on Season 4 Finale  This has never happened, I don’t think any of these 3 were at the season 4 finale (at least I’m sure about Kelly and Fantasia)     steph6449   This article that someone posted is nominally about Pia but what is says about the process for Scotty and Lauren’s albums is ~interesting. Country music shake and bake, apparently   http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/idol-worship/american-idol-cast-pia-toscano-192453  Toscano isn’t the only finalist Jerkins has been working with. With a directive from Interscope Geffen A&M chairman Jimmy Iovine, he’s been tasked with composing songs for runner-up Lauren Alaina and winner Scotty McCreery. “This was training for us producers,” Jerkins tells THR. “I wrote five country songs last week. It’s transformed not just the contestants but even the producer. Tricky [Stewart] produced that ‘Mama’ song for Lauren, and he said, ‘With this show, we’re not just urban pop guys anymore.’ George Strait can call me tomorrow and I’m ready to go!”  . Watching some of the videos, not sure how old Gladys Knight is these days but she sounds fantastic with tons of presence on stage.     musicality   I had to laugh when Durbin came out in that outfit. He looked like he was going out for Halloween. Halford took Durbin to school and showed him what a metal singer should sound like. It highlighted the shrillness of Durbin’s voice. Carrie took Lauren to school too. That duet showed the weakness in Lauren’s voice too. But with Lauren it’s probably lack of confidence. The duet between Casey and Jack Black was fun. Who knew Casey was such a fun type of guy. JLo’s dancing was cringe inducing. When I look at JLo I keep seeing my mom. She’s pretty but still – ewwwww. I couldn’t figure out how GaGa managed to still sing loud and strong without missing a beat when she put the microphone done while she was doing that awkward dance with the guy. A for Halford D for Durbin A for Carrie D for Lauren A for McGraw A- for Scotty A for Bennett A- for Haley A for Jack Black B+ for Casey     tinawina   That finale was awesome. Nigel is the king of producers. I don’t know who Simon has doing the XFactor, bit that person has their work cut out for them. I can’t even list my favorite moments because there were too many. I loved all the top 6 duets with celebrities, the little vignettes with the contestants, the girls with Beyonce, Mark Anthony (HAWT), Gaga, Scotty trying to catch confetti with his tongue, Beyonce singing her heart out… I could go on. Anyway, I had a blast watching that. Highly entertaining and ended the season on an emotional high. And since everyone else is doing it, my favorite winners: Kelly Fanny David Kris Ruben Carrie Scotty Taylor Jordin (large gap) Lee Fav seasons, in order (didn’t watch most of S1 so I don’t rank that one) 5, 7, 4, 10, 8, 3, 2, 6, 9 Fav contestants: Kelly, Fanny, Nadia Turner, Bo, Paris, Mandisa, Melinda, Blake, Brooke, Amanda Overmeyer, David C, Allison, Adam, Kris, Crystal Bowersox, Pia, Haley, Naima    http://ucsub.colorado.edu/~hansenkd/BrahmsGuides  MahlerFan   Also wanted to add an interview with Casey and Haley last night that really showed their chemistry. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHc6C7hdA0U&feature=player_embedded   This is a beautiful interview. Haley is so awesome in every way and Casey is such a joyful human being. I don’t know why they are making such a huge point out of denying any romance. They are so obviously perfect for each other. Hey, if Casey does manage to land Haley, he is the real winner of Season 10 (great comment posted on the video by somebody). Both have Chicago roots, so it could actually work. Does anybody really believe that nothing happened? I call BS. They at least made out. All pure speculation, of course, but I adore both of them and in my dreams they are making extraordinarily talented musical babies together.     Valentin432   maskedscheduler masked scheduler Early returns project #IDOL to be up about 10% in viewers from last year’s finale as well aa in 18-49′s and teens. 3 minutes ago     Nina1   Excellent, excellent show! I guess that means it is summer now and TV wasteland! I loved Beyonce, she is just so, so  clean ! And kudos to Mark Anthony! Jack Black outsung Casey. Scot outsung McGraw, but Tim wins body. Pia and Naima were  soooo  good. I sure hope Naima gets a career. (I think Pia has one.) And all the girls did wonderful group numbers. Carrie seemed to be trying to help Lauren, which was nice. Haley was fantastic (and so needs to do a jazz album). A great production, just great!    http://wwpv.smcvt.edu  VAidolFan09   As for the judges, I would love to see the self-aggrandizing jealous JLO leave.  Who the heck is JLO supposed to be jealous of?     savgal   Really disappointed there was no Scotty/Lauren duet last night, but hopefully they will record an original–guarantee it would make $$$. Saw ILYTB at #2 on iTunes and LMMD at #4. Both of their voices are amazing recorded. Even though not very crazy about Scotty’s debut song, was great for him to sing while hugging his family and the other Idols. Carrie’s song “Inside Your Heaven” was dumb, too, but it made some bucks–was quickly forgotten when “Jesus, Take the Wheel” came out. So I am hoping for a song the calibre of JTTW for Scotty. I think Lauren’s song fits her to a T. “Scot outsung McGraw, but Tim wins body.” — great comment! Made me laugh out loud.    http://ucsub.colorado.edu/~hansenkd/BrahmsGuides  MahlerFan   Come on. JLo’s dance was hot and sexy. That whole number was pretty damn fantastic. If Marc comes with the contract, I can think of liabilities that are a LOT worse.    http://ucsub.colorado.edu/~hansenkd/BrahmsGuides  MahlerFan   Really disappointed there was no Scotty/Lauren duet last night  Because they didn’t sing enough duets over the course of the season? Would have been overkill. When Taylor and Kat sang “Time of My Life,” it was new because they had never done anything together, so it was interesting. Scotty and Lauren had already sung together multiple times, competitively and non-competitively. Really no reason to do it again.     Kirsten   They are charting now but it means nothing because most of these singles were purchased weeks ago (except Scotty and Lauren’s new singles)   How can it mean nothing? They are charting now because they are selling now. The iTunes rank shows how many singles have sold within the last so many days (it’s a rolling window). They don’t batch up all the sales and report them when they suddenly stop suppressing them from charting. Eeps. If that’s real, then sounds like something is definitely going on behind the scenes. If it’s a joke, I’m no Lee fan but it’s a pretty tasteless and gratuitous one.  Yep. So strange. Maybe Nigel was drunk tweeting again.     Kirsten   Toscano isn’t the only finalist Jerkins has been working with. With a directive from Interscope Geffen A&M chairman Jimmy Iovine, he’s been tasked with composing songs for runner-up Lauren Alaina and winner Scotty McCreery. “This was training for us producers,” Jerkins tells THR. “I wrote five country songs last week. It’s transformed not just the contestants but even the producer. Tricky [Stewart] produced that ‘Mama’ song for Lauren, and he said, ‘With this show, we’re not just urban pop guys anymore.’ George Strait can call me tomorrow and I’m ready to go!”  Um…Iovine does realize that he has two kids who have the makings of being country artists right? Shouldn’t he be trying to get actual country songwriters to write some songs for them? They’d seem a lot less like carpetbaggers if he did.  Come on Iovine, you chose songs so well last week. Don’t forget your head just so your favourite producers can have more work.     TLKC   I hope the story about Lee declining to present the award isn’t true. I do feel bad for him but David Cook was rumoured as well and he didn’t get a spot either, so he’s in very good company. They did put Lee in a highly visible location and we saw him behind Ryan off-and-on throughout the show, so they’re not dis-owning him or anything.     HR   Lauren hurt her voice. I’m going to assume some adjustments were made to allow her to rest it that may have included numbers she was to have participated in.  I’m going to say the theory that no one cares about the contestants this year and only is entertained by the show is off to a rough start with the tour selling better and each of the two finalists having a song in the top ten on Itunes this year. I can’t say I know what their opening album sales will be but it does look to be better then last year.     Jae   Goodmorning! This is the first time since s7 that I have woken up after my season fave took the title. I have nothing to gripe about. Weird!  I wish the best for all these kids and can’t wait to see them on tour. It was nice seeing Thia and Karen sing so well on the finale. I had liked them so much early on. Now just awaiting all the media fun!  Thanks as always for these threads MJ!     windmills   Kirsten: Um…Iovine does realize that he has two kids who have the makings of being country artists right? Shouldn’t he be trying to get actual country songwriters to write some songs for them? They’d seem a lot less like carpetbaggers if he did.  UMG Nashville is definitely putting country writers to work for them. For instance Dallas Davidson is lined up to work with Scotty. He had hand in writing the most country #1s in 2010, he’s a cowriter on Lady A’s Just A Kiss (not the best recommendation!), and he cowrote with CaseyJ earlier this year. I expect the rest of the Peach Pickers are involved too. Rodney Jerkins cowriting a song for Scotty may not be the worst thing in that I think a good country soul song could work for Scotty BUT it needs to be somebody country writing the lyrics. If not then forget it (but Scotty will probably be stuck with it anyway).  Scotty and LaurenA will be setting a record for the highest debut week (digital) sales for a debut single by a male and female country act respectively. If Scotty’s song were better then I’d say he had a chance at breaking the debut week record for a single for all male country acts (138k – Blake Shelton’s Honeybee).  I don’t think they’ll be getting carpetbagger accusations. For all their other flaws, it’s clear Scotty and LaurenA are rooted in country. They do have other issues to overcome in the country world though.     luvmy5guys   Overall loved the finale.. but of all the performances that were cut short … why Steven Tyler! He was actually what I looked forward to the most.. he was awesome but way too short (the should have shortened Marc Anthony and let Steven do a full out Dream On     Valentin432   Rewatched the corronation moment and Scotty’s was the first since Cook that was emotional with no awkwerdness and the guys is really charismatic, probably the main reason for his success. Also “I Love You This Big” is an easy title to use in every idol conversation, even better than “No Boundaries”.     Nostradamas   So, after spending the night dodging tornados and wind storms, I watched some of the clips here to recap……..and the most  obvious thing I saw was that the two LEAST talented children were in the final two….great job AI voters….yea really great….. Oh well, their 15 minutes of fame are nearly over…prepare to crash and burn in the real world kiddies…     Valentin432   In a show that had 3 of the best performers of the past 10 years, Steven Tyler was hands down my favorite performance. He reminded everyone what it means to be a rockstar. Beyonce was magnificent, I never bought one cd of hers but I’ll be the first to buy a concert ticket. I think it’s a huge coup to get Bono and The Edge on the show and the Spiderman thing was ok. Lady Gaga was upstaged even tough I was really happy that Mark K got such a great gig    http://www.amadcow2.com  amadcow2   Thanks MJ and members of this site for an entertaining season. In looking back, I see a lot of positive and negative about this year. I think that the judges did a great job of selecting a very diverse and talented top 13, but then they dropped the ball with consistency during the meat of the season. Watching last night’s show gave me the following random thoughts: - I loved the personalities and talent in the top 13. I did think that the top 2 were boring. - voting needs to be addressed to reflect more favorably on the viewing audience. - I missed Paul’s drunken uncle dance (and his tweets) - Thia did herself a disservice by trying out this year. She should have waited two years and then won the whole thing. - Karen was a much better singer than 12th place. - I missed Naima’s energy. I hope she does well. - Haley’s growth and story was epic and I wish she won. - James and Casey were eliminated at about the right spot for each. - Pia was her own worst enemy. She lost by playing the game safe like if she was in season 3. - Scotty is a real nice kid and deserves only good things. - Lauren should have been eliminated around top 4 - Randy needs to go away… far away.     lucy   Wow, Ryan certainly had a lot of product to pimp last night.     Trina   David performed TWICE this season including just the night before! And he won three years ago. Why should anyone feel bad he wasn’t on last night? He’s not anywhere near the same boat as Lee.    http://ucsub.colorado.edu/~hansenkd/BrahmsGuides  MahlerFan   Overall loved the finale.. but of all the performances that were cut short … why Steven Tyler! He was actually what I looked forward to the most.. he was awesome but way too short (the should have shortened Marc Anthony and let Steven do a full out Dream On  Haley and Casey complained about that in the interview. Casey wanted Steven to have the full choir and everything.    http://ucsub.colorado.edu/~hansenkd/BrahmsGuides  MahlerFan   Lady Gaga was upstaged even tough I was really happy that Mark K got such a great gig  I actually quite enjoyed the song. I was hoping for a new souped-up piano, though.     saramcvt   First, I want to thank MJ for providing such a great place to stay current on all things AI (and other shows like the Voice). I did enjoy last night’s finale! So many good performances, but my fav was the guy’s group number with Tom Jones. The guys just seemed so happy and in sync. Everything about that number was Win for me. I also thought Scotty showed why he was a top contender all season. He really held his own with Tim McGraw (who is still a fantastically handsome man). The other thing I will take away was the geniune support and care on display between Scotty and Lauren. They may be only friends, but they are SO darn cute together!!!!!! Overall, a great night!     Nina1   I was so upset Lee DeWyze wouldn’t present the winners trophy to Scotty. Especially as he’d been on the show this Season. I guess he was shy  Nigel is rewriting history again. If I had to choose who to believe in any situation, it sure wouldn’t be Nigel.     tripp_ncwy   Wow, Ryan certainly had a lot of product to pimp last night.  I’m glad I was not the only one who noticed.     Buffynut   Anyway, I do have a question. Were any of the production numbers shot before the show? That string of non-Idol performances seemed to feature some serious set-pieces and I’m not sure they could have put them all up and broken them down during the commercial breaks (granted, the commercial breaks were long enough). And at some point they would have had to have extracted Spiderman from the rafters.  Kirsten, it looks like girlygirl hasn’t answered this yet. I was at the Finale also and every performance was live. They setup all the production during commercials. The commercials to me, seemed many and long! One of the Spiderman guys came down from a platform above my head, between Orch. and Balcony. He was there for a bit before the Bono number actually started. The only close call, the whole night (as far as setting up goes,) was the spider web that was the background while they were singing. It wasn’t going back up to the ceiling, like it was supposed to. It had dropped down from the ceiling for set up. It even warranted Nigel going up on stage to see what was wrong. They finally got it off with maybe 2 seconds to spare. We were all wondering WTF they were going to do if they couldn’t get that thing off the stage. It was a great finale. And as great as it sounded on TV, I have come to the conclusion that nothing should ever be televised from The Nokia. The sound and the voices live were 10X better than the broadcast!     Karen   dizzyfeet: I was so upset Lee DeWyze wouldn’t present the winners trophy to Scotty. Especially as he’d been on the show this Season. I guess he was shy  Maybe Nigel wanted the trophy presentation done like the Huff and Lee objected.

Lol : Totally agree with this.     tripp_ncwy   Scotty billboard not sure where maybe LA.  http://twitpic.com/52r37r      ross   There were some great things on the finale – I think I especially enjoyed the guys’ group number – it was a lot of fun. Kinda predictable they’d have Scotty do Tom Jones country song, though. Reminded me it’s a new kind of Idol where all season, someone whose talents are limited to one genre hardly ever has to go outside his wheelhouse, and then wins. I’m not a big fan of Scotty but not sorry he won and congrats to him – nice kid. I didn’t especially enjoy the season, and can’t say if I’ll be watching next year or not. I really prefer more musically mature contestants, overall. Cook, Castro, Archie, Adam, Casey James, Lee, Crystal, and especially my favorite, Kris, to name just a few who I’ve either loved, liked or admired the past few years. I felt their musicality and tastes in music were wide ranging and interesting and they were almost standing up for something they believed in, when it came to music. This year was much more showbiz; I didn’t especially like the limiting of instruments (though Season 9 was not great, I don’t know if that was the reason), and I didn’t feel there was a lot of musical maturity to a lot of the performers. I didn’t dislike any of them but I was bored as a music fan. Just my opinion, not trying to rain on the parade! Thanks, MJ, once more for the great coverage and for letting us express our opinions here!    http://wwpv.smcvt.edu  VAidolFan09   All in all, a fantastic end to a fantastic season! I wish some of my early favorites stuck around longer but I’m damn satisfied with the outcome.  Lady GaGa was great as usual. The Edge of Glory is a really powerful song, IMO.  And (not counting season 9, because I’m pretending it never happened) I finally had my favorite win again! First time since Taylor Hicks!     lucy   Wow, Ryan certainly had a lot of product to pimp last night. I’m glad I was not the only one who noticed.  Don’t think you were! He enunciated each placement very carefully so we would be *sure* to notice. (That was probably written into all the guests’ contracts….) I was waiting to hear him announce that somebody had a new line of souffle mixes or hair-care products coming out, honestly. My winners’ ranking (based on my personal music taste only, of course — and I like the fact that there seem to have been winners produced over the years to match a lot of people’s different tastes, which is a cool, and kind of unexpected thing about the show, it seems.): Kelly Fantasia Medium-sized gap Ruben David Carrie Big gap Kris Big gap  Jordin Taylor Humungous gap Lee Scotty    http://myspace.com/susanatfox  sumidol   “”HOLY MOLY. From Worst. Final. Evah. to BEST FINALE EVAAHHHH! Congratulations Mr. Nigel Lygoe on a job well done. Season “”" Exactly! I did not watch the final because I knew it would be bad and from all accounts it was but the finale!!!! wonderful awesomeness, even though another boring guy won, that we probably wont hear much about again, in a year or two, other than that, last night was great! I do wish Scotty well, he seems like the nicest kid     TLKC   David performed TWICE this season including just the night before! And he won three years ago. Why should anyone feel bad he wasn’t on last night? He’s not anywhere near the same boat as Lee.   Oh my bad! Didn’t watch the night before and spent all of last night waiting for David to show up! Glad he wasn’t bumped and sorry that Lee was.    http://myspace.com/susanatfox  sumidol   The saddest thing though last night was (even though I just never cared for Lee) seeing he and his wife peeking at the camera from behind Ryan and not getting any recognition at all as last years winner, handing off the trophy sort of thing should have been done, at least? If not a song from Lee, I felt so bad for the guy, he looked kind of ashamed or mad?     Sassycatz   I hope the story about Lee declining to present the award isn’t true. I do feel bad for him but David Cook was rumoured as well and he didn’t get a spot either, so he’s in very good company.  The press kept getting “performing on the finale” mixed up with performing on final two night, for which David was scheduled and performed. Of course, it didn’t help that Idol, itself, was calling the two nights, “The Finale.”  I guess, Finale part 1 and Finale part 2.  So, no. There was no credible reports that David was scheduled to perform on Part 2 of the Finale, other than the rumors that were floating around earlier that all the winning idols would perform in celebration of the 10 Year Anniversary which clearly didn’t happen and might have been an earlier plan which was dropped. Who knows. ETA: Also it’s hard to feel sorry for a guy who not only closed the Top Two performance night but was used in the opening of the show, with Carrie, as a former Idol winner who went from singing as a child to winning the show and becoming a successful recording artist.     tripp_ncwy   sumidol, Lee is not married. That was his girlfriend.     tripp_ncwy   They didn’t even do the previous winner’s video package this season and I thought Lee shot some footage for that.     sonyab   Contestants sing Born This Way: Oh man I hate this song!!! It reminds me too much of express yourself!  James Durbin and Judas Priest: WOAH! Perfect fit!!!! Can JD join the band? Can he? Can he?!   Randy Jackson: What is going on with ths show? He’s in it to win it! ROFL!  Jacob Lusk,Kirk Franklin and Gladys Knight: Perfect fit!!!! Jacob Lusk should be a gospel singer!!   Jack Black and Casey Abrams: WOAH! That was awesome! I loved it!!!! They are the next supercouple!  Their couple name can be Jasey!  Oh kiss already! ROFL!  Beyonce with the girls: When her and the girls were singing single ladies? I was too distracted over Beyonce’s outfit. I was thinking is she going to have a wardrobe malfuncion?  Haley Reinnhart and Tony Bennett: PERFECT FIT!!!  That was great!!! Smooth baby very smooth!   Scotty McCreery and Tim McGraw: Perfect fit!!! They were great together!  Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez: Wow that was fun, sexy, and hot!!! I loved it!!  Contestants talking about their eliminations: Hahaha that was hysterical! No Casey no you don’t suck!   Scotty’s music teacher, and Lauren’s principle: Why would they get a car? Strange.  Lady Gaga and that man with her: They looked like they were having sex on that cliff. That was a strange performance.   The contestants talking about how young the Top 2 are: ROFL! Great stuff!  Steven Tyler: YEAH STEVEN YEAH! You still are a great singer! I love you!   Beyonce: Her singing her song. American idol is not a family show anymore is it?  And she kept bending down. I thought she was going to have a wardrobe malfuncion!  Scotty and Lauren: Wow it looked like Scotty had more people in his hometown than Lauren. Scotty: HE WON YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really really thought Lauren was going to win! I guess people weren’t affected by Lauren and her mother.  Damn I lost all my pool points. I gave it all to Lauren. DAMN!  Scotty was hugging his family awww! Uh Scotty? Jack Black wanted you to hug him too! Don’t forget Jack Black!!!       windmills   Josh Turner tweeted  @SMcCreeryAI10 Congrats on winning @AmericanIdol!! Why were you so emotional? LOL! Proud of you for giving God the glory!      dinaa68   mmmm…I didn’t enjoy the finale as much as I thought I would. Too much emphasis on celebrities and not enough on the contestants. Although I do love Lady Gaga and enjoyed her performance. Also, why did the girls get a current, relevant performer like Beyonce to sing with while the guys had to do a Tom Jones medley? At least the guys had fun with it. I’m a James girl, so I thought he and Priest totally killed it, although I was sad that his dream of singing with Steven wasn’t realized. When Steven started singing, my heart started pounding, hoping for James to appear. Alas, did not happen. Scotty and Lauren are good kids, still, it should have been James and Pia in the finale, with James winning.     Landmd   Was a great show last night, so much better than the sleep inducing final two night!! Haley was great last night, cant wait to hear new music from her!! Still ticked at AI for the disrepect they show towards Lee and all fans of the show, really looks bad for the show if that is how they treat any winner. My rankings for past winners: 1. Lee 2. David 3. Kelly 4. Kris 5. Carrie 6. Scotty 7. Jordin 8. Rubin 9 Taylor 10 Fantasia     kvwicks13   Maybe that’s why everyone liked the finale so much because it was not so much about the contestants. That’s how the show was all year long, more pimping of judges than the contestants.     dinaa68   PS: Lee WAS treated very badly. He should have been invited to perform, or at the very least acknowledged during the show. And it was unnecessary of Nigel to tweet about him “refusing” to present the trophy. Talk about kicking someone when they’re down…     artemis   My favorite Idol winners: 1.Lee DeWyze 2.David Cook 3.Liked the rest of them,except this year.Just not a fan, but he seems like a nice kid-good luck to him. Nigel is totally lacking in class, unlike Lee.He’s been getting lots of upset tweets from fans and some flack in the press from people like Lindsey Parker for his treatment of Lee in leaving him off.the Finale. Lee just spent two weeks in Asia and in every one of his many interviews he praised the show, Season 10, and the talent of the contestants. Nigel repays him by trying to flip the situation and making Lee look like a diva.Lee DeWyze is one of the nicet people on the planet. Nigel-not so much.     girlygirl   Nigel has lost it if he thinks Lee is the one to blame here. Nigel & the other TPTB totally disrespected last year’s winner and the smart fans realize that. They did give Lee a shout out to the audience last night, but it was during a commercial break (they also pointed out Cook, Adam and Gordon Ramsey during commercial breaks)     lucy   That’s how the show was all year long, more pimping of judges than the contestants.  If they bring back this group of judges, I don’t think I’ll watch next year. Boring boring boring. And not helpful to the contestants, either, in my opinion….. I like contest shows because you can see people get motivated to improve and grow and struggle. I saw next to nothing of that this year. But I did hear a lot of crap about JLo and Steven’s new videos and books and winning beauty and the like. If they want that, they should buy infomercial time, in my opinion. They can afford it.     LaurelG   I agree with whomever said the AI Finale is a much more enjoyable experience without a dog in the hunt. Overall the performances were really solid, a testament to the high level of talent this year. If Haley wasn’t going to win it then I’m satisfied with Scotty taking the title. Hard to believe he’s just 17. Way more ready for primetime than Lauren.  The cut away shots of Jack Black in the audience were hysterical. He was certainly having fun. lol. I thought Karen, Thia and Pia sounded fantastic in their solo bits. And I really liked the comedy bits, especially the ones with Casey, James and Stefano. Very funny stuff. Wow. Marc Anthony’s glazed, sweaty look was seriously distracting. He looked as if he’d been starved and held hostage in a dungeon for 5 months and then they put him in a car and drove him straight to the stage! ha. I honestly thought he was going to fall down at some point. And then there’s JLo standing next to him, positively glowing. What an odd couple.  That jazzy number Haley sang with Tony B. was right in her wheelhouse. She sounded like a seasoned pro. I hope she gets to make a record. ETA: Add my voice to the chorus who thinks Lee was treated poorly.     girlygirl   well, if we are going to rank our favorite Idol winners, I’ll throw in my 2 cents.  Kris Kelly David Carrie Jordin Taylor Ruben Fantasia Lee Scotty     girlygirl   Kirsten sorry, I crashed quickly after I posted, so I didn’t see your question. Nope, all of the production numbers last night were live. The audience was a LITTLE nervous before the Spiderman one. Didn’t want ol’ Spidey landing on anyone…     lucy   PS: Lee WAS treated very badly. He should have been invited to perform, or at the very least acknowledged during the show. And it was unnecessary of Nigel to tweet about him “refusing” to present the trophy. Talk about kicking someone when they’re down… This is such a jerky move on Nigel’s part that I’m loath to believe it happened. But I guess it did. Depressing.       Ladybug   I don’t check in as much here as in the past, but I was a spectator, pure and simple, this year. No investment at all in who won. I will say that this was a really,  really good finale. So much better than I expected and the girls rocked the show last night, for me. I still think the S5 finale was the best ever and even last night did not change that opinion, though it was a terrific evening of entertainment. Loved the humor bits, too. Done just right. I have long since accepted that Idol will showcase the winners (and non-winners) it considers successes and ignore the rest. It is what it is — Taylor, Kris, Lee. See you guys with the other valet parking attendants. It is also interesting reading everyone’s favorite Idol winners, so I will have a go as well: 1. Taylor 2. Kelly 3. Ruben All the rest can be 4-9 in any order. No favorite. No one I much care about musically. #10 Fantasia will always be last on any of my lists. My list of favorite Idols consists of a lot of Idol also-rans (Bo, Clay, Brooke, Archie, Adam + others). I do thank the crazy machine that is American Idol for introducing me to them, and to the world.    http://www.amadcow2.com  amadcow2   MJ, perhaps there should be some discussion on ‘lessons learned’ on this blog. It would be interesting to hear what everyone thinks (I’m sure that there are some common themes). Here are my thoughts (now only if Nigel were reading this…): - The selection process, Hollywood week, and top 24 pick were about right on target this year. I would try to keep to that formula and look for another talented and diverse crop. - The top 24 to top 13 bloodbath was a little severe. I don’t think that the final 13 was necessarily the best 13 from that group. I would look at top 6 from each group and 2 wild cards to make a top 14. - Voting needs to change. Power voting is just too prevalent. When you can download an app for your phone that sends out 100 votes per hour, or you can multiply your votes by setting up groups with the same number, things are bad and the vote total doesn’t equal the demographic of the viewing audience. Even ‘dial idol’ automates the voting process (albeit with outdated technology). The bottom line is that voting needs to be more reflective of the viewing public, still allow for fans to vote multiple times, and still make money for their sponsors. My idea is to have diminishing returns on votes over a certain limit (i.e., over 50 votes then votes count 1/2 or 1/10). - The judges need to provide help to the contestants. JLo was very constructive at some points, but totally not at others. Steven was fun, but irrelevant. What ONE change, would be best? Replace Randy with Jimmy Iovine. Randy is more than useless. He’s inconsistent. The fact of the matter is that all three judges dropped the ball during the elimination rounds and that hurt the show. - Have fresher themes. Themes are great in that it forces creativity on the contestants. However, we can’t just have these same moldy old themes year after year. Ideas for theme nights would be: acapella night, songs without rhythm (no strings or drums allowed in the arrangement), Bluegrass night, songs your parents made out to, … the list goes on.. just make it fresh and not a retread … except for Beatles week.. you can never go wrong with the Beatles       shwriteme   That’s it. I’m done with American Idol. They had a great pool of talent this year and still, we get one of the mediocre performers as a winner. It’s happened too many times for me. No more.     sonyab   luval says: Am so glad Beyonce didn’t sing her new single. yuk  What’s her new single?     Jon   My Final thoughts on the season are that it was pretty good. Not the best season ever, but it was still one of my favorites. If i had to rank the season to past seasons, best to worst, i think i’ll go with: 1. Season 8 2. Season 7 3. Season 5 4. Season 10 5. Season 4 6. Season 2 7. Season 1 8. Season 6 9. Season 3 10. Season 9 I think I’m more partial to Season 10 because of Haley. If she wasn’t on the show I would of tuned out when Casey was eliminated because he was entertaining to watch. It’s no surprise that Haley was the only one to grow on the show with being the only one getting real critiques. As much it was so frustrating to watch her being the only getting picked on, it did help her along the way and it did make her comeback all the more satisfying. Next year the judges NEED to up their game. Unfortunately, this marks the first year where my favorite didn’t make it into Top 2. Hope next year America actually gets it right from the beginning, but not getting my hopes up.     McCreerian   If they bring back this group of judges, I don’t think I’ll watch next year. Boring boring boring. And not helpful to the contestants, either, in my opinion….. I like contest shows because you can see people get motivated to improve and grow and struggle. I saw next to nothing of that this year.  I think they will improve next year. Kara was pretty bad her first year, but the year after she was very constructive and gave some good advice. Yes, she was condescending at times, but she knew what she was talking about. I think the judges have work cut out for them next year.     jing_ftw   perhaps there should be some discussion on ‘lessons learned’ on this blog.  If I have to name one change it has to be limiting the votes. When a show watched by around 20 million people, most of whom will not pick up the phone and vote for anyone, gets 120 million votes, you know something is wrong. Limit it to 10 votes per method. A distant second would be more sharp-but-real criticism from the judges. But I even think that fixing the voting would improve the judging.     Mel1   I hope Scotty has a nice career, however, I have to disagree that he deserves to win because he is such a nice, well-mannered teen and will be a good role model. This is a singing competition, not a nice guy/girl role model competition.     LaleyFan   Scotty did NOT deserve to win AT ALL. Nothing will ever make me believe otherwise. However, great show. Lauren’s going to kick Scotty’s ass in the real world! I have no doubt.     lucy   I think they will improve next year. Kara was pretty bad her first year, but the year after she was very constructive and gave some good advice. Yes, she was condescending at times, but she knew what she was talking about. I think the judges have work cut out for them next year.  I hope you’re right. But I kind of think that ST and JL are just too much big-time performers with way too much vested interest in being liked to ever function as actual judges. If the studio audience starts booing them — and they will, if they say the least little critical thing, no matter how helpful and kindly intended — I have a hard time seeing either of them continuing to criticize. Performers don’t like getting booed! And they *love* the warm waves of studio-audience affection they get when they just say “Beautiful!” and “Perfect! Ya did it again!”     idolwatcher   All I can say is thank goodness for my dvr. Don’t know if it was just me or what but I could not have sat through that finale if I had to watch all of it. One of the strangest finales I’ve seen. And I think I’ve seen all I need to see of Jennifer and her hubby – I hope not to see her on the judging panel next year. When they played the video of Steven Tyler’s judging antics I realized that was what was missing during the actual competition. I feel like he just put in his time and remembered to mumble “beautiful” when it was his turn. He could be a real asset (emphasis on “could”).     samgamgee   My Final thoughts on the season are that it was pretty good. Not the best season ever, but it was still one of my favorites. If i had to rank the season to past seasons, best to worst, i think i’ll go with: 1. Season 8 2. Season 7 3. Season 5 4. Season 10 5. Season 4 6. Season 2 7. Season 1 8. Season 6 9. Season 3 10. Season 9  I find it interesting that people can be poles apart when it comes to appreciating music. My favorite season ever is Season 9 because the singer-songwriter types are the closest to my heart. They’re like my soul mates. There were so many unique and indie contestants last year such as Crystal, Didi, and Lilly.     lucy   There were so many unique and indie contestants last year such as Crystal, Didi, and Lilly.  True … except that Lilly didn’t even make it into the Top 12. …. That fact alone kind of bummed me about Season 9, I admit! (and then Didi and Siobhan, for example, kept disappointing me …) You’re making me realize how many different factors go into how I feel about a season!     zzatrms   I’d also like to say thank you to MJ. I don’t know how she does it. She is always up to date not only on American Idol, but also other entertainment news.     alxsavage   My favorite season ever is Season 9 because the singer-songwriter types are the closest to my heart. They’re like my soul mates. There were so many unique and indie contestants last year such as Crystal, Didi, and Lilly.  Amen to this. I would add Katelyn Epperly to the list. It was like having a fresh, young edition of Lilith Fair on tv. Specially Lilly, the one and only real hipster that Idol’s ever had. Girl’s got great taste, if she had been on the Top 12 I’m sure she would have given us at least a couple of “moments”. Such a haunting voice! But she was right, the kind of people that appreciate her are not the ones voting, or even watching the show. This year’s final 2 is a confirmation of that. I still prefer many of the girls on last year’s top 24 to any of the contestants from this season. It’s a taste thing, I guess.     Reflections On Life   The Promise of a season is much different than the Success of a season. IMHO Season 9 Promised to be the best season ever for me, exactly for the Lilith Fair aspect. But it bombed as a season, though Crystal’s run was stellar. Fantastic Finale show! Worth watching on TV (I’ve been following the season via this blog’s videos and occasionally the live stream posting). Extremely entertaining, musical diversity, comedy, beautiful sets.  Beyonce’s solo was the first time I ever heard her truly connect emotionally with a song – she tends to be more of a technical & vocal-acrobatics singer but w/o a soul – that performance shows that she’s really grown.     hicksaholic   Much much better finale than I expected. Neither Lauren nor Scotty are my favorites so it was kind of nice to just sit back and enjoy. I too thought it was wrong of TPTB to exclude Lee. Not sure why they didn’t save him for finale instead of earlier in the season. My rankings of my favorites(at least as best I can remember) 1) Taylor Hicks 2) Matt Giraud 3) Casey Abrams 4) Crystal Bowersox 5) Elliott Yamin 6) Adam Lambert 7) Bo Bice Fantasia 9) Melinda Doolittle 10) Ruben Studdard I’m definite on 1 and 2. The rest might move around a little.     hoosiermama   They did give Lee a shout out to the audience last night, but it was during a commercial break (they also pointed out Cook, Adam and Gordon Ramsey during commercial breaks)  Ah gee,  girlygirl , I was already sad for Lee, but now I’m sad for Kris, too! He got no love last night, but Gordon Ramsey got a shout out? Oh Nigel. *sigh* Overall, though, I really enjoyed the finale. Love me some Tom Jones and Tony Bennett, and the idols who sang with them were great (the girls with Beyonce, too). Even Jacob was good with Gladys Knight. I laughed at the comedy bits as well. I could have done without the solo promo singers, but whatever. The results were as expected and I wish Scotty and Lauren all the best!     smart141voter   No Conspiracy in American Idol? Really? 1. The demographic of American Idol viewers is mostly viewers from the Southern States (South) (see wikipedia). 2. The rating trend was downward. This year revenue is down 17% than last year. New producer (Nigel Lythgoe) has to do something about it. 3. Out of 10 winners 8 winners were from the South (2 of them are very successful: Kelly Clarkson & Carrie Underwood; the majority of their music-genre fans is from the South). 4. There were 2 ‘potential’ contenders from the South in Top 13 (Lauren Alaina & Scott McCreery; their music-genre is popular in the South). 5. The voting system is NOT verifiable. Even if a contestant is considered very talented by the music experts/industry/viewers, he/she can be voted off, and suspicion about manipulation is almost zero. Because in people’s mind: “Because viewers can vote unlimited, contestant whose fans vote like ‘crazy’ will win, contestants who can’t generate excitement will lose.” This is where TPTB has the ‘loophole’: they reserve the right to disqualify, block or remove any votes from any individual. They have created their own privilege to steer the direction of the outcome of the show to what they deem necessary for the sake of the show. Viewers are just ‘pawns’ and ‘scapegoats’ (“How come they are so stupid to vote him/her off?”; Remember: ‘cougars’/’tweens/teens were to be blamed ) The contestants are the talented young musicians who are in desperate need to survive. Absolutely they are thankful for being exposed to millions and got (meagerly) paid too (they get $1000/week; in comparison: host, judges get between $10M-$20M for each of them; who knows how big is the chunk for TPTB) Remember: without these contestants, there is no show. But they better shut up. The repercussion is huge. 6. The goal of “All New” American Idol was to reverse the downward trend. How? Courting the viewers from the South. How? The winner has to be from the South. 7. Eliminate all 5 female contestants (they all are NOT from the South) 8. Then Paul, Stefano, Casey, Jacob, James, Haley. 9. Lauren & Scotty: in the final. 1st & 2nd from the South. Double whammy. Rating soaring (majority of viewers (South) love it). Trend reversed (even without Simon, wow). Goal achieved. Huge success. $$$ pouring in. ‘Long live American $dol (& N$gel)’!     Desdemona   McCreerian says: 05/26/2011 at 4:20 am My rankings: 1. Carrie Underwood 2. Scotty McCreery 3. Kelly Clarkson 4. Jordin Sparks 5. Kris Allen 6. David Cook 7. Fantasia Barrino 8. Lee Dewyze 9. Ruben Studdard 10. Taylor Hicks   Awwww, poo!   Taylor Hicks is my #1 If James had won this year, he’d be #2 I’m not really particular about the order of the others. Like them all. (I am glad Scotty won, and I downloaded his single this morning. Honestly, I really like it and hope he sells a million plus)!     ross   I have long since accepted that Idol will showcase the winners (and non-winners) it considers successes and ignore the rest. It is what it is — Taylor, Kris, Lee. See you guys with the other valet parking attendants.  I can’t speak for the other two but as a Kris fan, I can’t complain; he was on the show twice last year (charity performance for Haiti, single and group number on the finale). This year, he was asked in one interview if he’d be on, said that “we talked about it,” but apparently it wasn’t the time. I don’t know what he would have done, a cover? Why? When he has new music, he’ll be there. Anyhow, I don’t agree with the parking attendant analogy, I guess.   I think the Lee thing was weird. Of course he should have been asked to appear, even briefly, on camera. There’s a precedent for the reigning Idol to make one last appearance before the new one is crowned – so why not just do it?     weese   Scotty won using a strategy you would only use if you were miles ahead in the voting right from the start. It is hard to say he shouldn’t have won–he wasn’t bad–ever. If I was trying out for Idol I would move to the south and be really really nice. Youngsters who have dreams of winning this thing–plan ahead.     ross   Scotty won using a strategy you would only use if you were miles ahead in the voting right from the start. It is hard to say he shouldn’t have won–he wasn’t bad–ever. If I was trying out for Idol I would move to the south and be really really nice. Youngsters who have dreams of winning this thing–plan ahead.  The key to winning is included in your post – don’t be bad, ever. Not everyone who’s always good wins, but it can’t hurt. Personally I thought this was a weak group; I don’t think he would have won in another year (a year where he would have been more challenged by the genres, the judges, or the other contestants) – but this was the year, and he did win.     ninergrl6   I usually LOVE the Idol finale regardless of who wins, but I honestly thought this was the worst finale in years. So many non-Idol related performances! There was no purpose for Gaga, Spiderman, and Beyonce’s 2nd performance beyond self-promotion. Yes, I realize 99% Idol performances are  about promotion, but those had no connection to anything Idol related. I was shocked that Scotty and Lauren didn’t sing a duet, even a reprise of one from earlier in the season. And I was hoping that Lauren would do “Don’t Want To Miss a Thing” with Steven. I can think of countless different ways the Idols (past and present) could have been utilized for the finale instead of pop stars with their own agendas. The whole thing was just disconnected and, for the most part, unsatisfying. Very disappointing.     bean99   I enjoyed the finale for the most part. Still miffed that they treated Lee that way. We could have done without the video of the worst singers. At the least, Ryan could have asked him something in the audience.  Scotty handled himself so well. Loved the hugging.  Lauren also. After crying when anyone left all season she had nary a tear for herself.  I enjoyed seeing Pia and huts wished she had more solos. Loved the most shocking boot video.     Ratna12   Here’s a photo — sort of like where’s Waldo. see if you can spot the 4 of them  http://twitpic.com/52k3jx   Thanks girlygirl. Finally found Kris just after I read the comment that he was wearing glasses. I, too was waiting for Cory to give shout-out to Kris.  Oh well.
