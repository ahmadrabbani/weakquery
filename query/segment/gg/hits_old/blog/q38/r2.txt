"I'm changing that image." From taking home the top prize on  American Idol , to scoring three number-one albums, to collecting five Grammys, Underwood has proven herself as a major star. And with her favorite smoky eyes ("me and black eyeliner go way back") and pumped-up locks ("I wish that big hair would come back in style") Underwood shows that she can turn on the glitzeven without rhinestones. "You want people to see you and think, 'Wow! She looks awesome,'" Underwood has said. "'Wow! She's a star.'"  As a high school senior in Checotah, Oklahoma, Underwood showed her familiarity with the curling iron.
