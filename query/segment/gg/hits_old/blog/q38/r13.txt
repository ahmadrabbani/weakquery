Kelly did an amazing job sing this song. I love both Idols.  pamdem  (11/12/2011 4:45:09 PM)  perhaps there is a better example of CU singing this song than her performance at the Grand Ole Opry, which i just watched. but truly, if this is your idea of clarity -- yes, she has power but her tone is -- harsh; dare I say even ugly. and her emotion does not match that which Clarkson brings. there are things she has done that i like very much. but in no way can she even begin to compare to KC.  lor3ng  (11/12/2011 3:38:48 PM)  In four words: Kelly is the best! :D  DirectorHands  (11/11/2011 9:41:12 PM)  I would love to hear Kelly, Adele and Jennifer Hudson perform this as a trio LIVE..... the place would be on FIRE!  puggle10  (11/11/2011 6:50:06 PM)  Kelly does a great job, but Carrie is simply untouchable. Yes, Kelly can sing in that growl/rasp to good effect, but it gets a little repetitive at times. Carrie sings with such power, clarity, and emotion that no one today can match her overall package. This song shows just how amazing her "Carnival Ride" cd was and should have won all the Best Album awards that year - instead George "Has Been" Strait got a career award over Carrie. Plain wrong. Bravo to Kelly and Carrie.     Kelly Clarkson - "I Know You Won't (Unplugged)"
