Sure, there were strapless gowns, up dos and diamonds, but for some reason, it all fell into place in a fresh and exciting way. Mila Kunis was pretty in a lavender lace gown by Elie Saab. More than anything it was the color that felt the most striking, playing a nice opposite against her raven hair. Michelle Williams’ pearly Chanel Haute Couture column gown worked so well with her platinum hair and even though there was no color in her ensemble, she didn’t look washed out, but rather totally gorgeous. Cate Blanchett is a red carpet risk taker and her choices usually turn out well. This time was no exception. Her pale pink Givenchy dress was so interestingly structured, with textured beads at the shoulders, it read like wearable art. Amy Adams looked like she was channeling Bianca Jagger in her navy blue beaded L’wren Scott dress and Cartier necklace. The shade of blue looked so good against her red hair and she perfectly nailed the sexy '70s look. It was great to see some vivid color on the red carpet and Jennifer Hudson was possibly the brightest star out there. Her tangerine toned Atelier Versace halter neck gown popped so amazingly against her skin and added a playful tone to this year’s Oscar fashion. A few disappointments: Melissa Leo’s white and gold Marc Bouwer dress was cool in theory, but the fact that the entire dress was constructed of that heavily textured fabric made it look weighty and wet suit thick. While I love how simple and elegant Jennifer Lawrence looked in her body-hugging Calvin Klein sheath, it was just a tad too casual and breezy. She could have done a great necklace with that deep of a scoop neck or maybe a statement bangle. --Melissa Magsaysay PHOTOS:   Photo gallery of all the red carpet best and worst dressed  Photos: Mila Kunis.
