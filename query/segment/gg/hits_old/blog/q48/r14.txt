Sometimes they look hot, sometimes not.  The Washington Post Sunday Source Deputy Editor  Suzanne D'Amato dissected Oscar fashion on  Monday, March 6, at 11 a.m. ET .  ____________________  Suzanne D'Amato: Good morning everyone! So...what'd you think? Who had the best dress last night? Whose fashion flopped? Send me your questions and comments!  _______________________  Los Angeles, Calif.: Fashion? What fashion? There wasn't a single dress of any distinction whatsoever. But that's no surprise as fashion is OVER. When Yves Saint-Laurent retired that was a clear signal that that was that. Now we've got publisexuals like Tom Ford, clowns like John Galliano and grotesques like Alexander McQueen. Meanwhile Vera Wang's ready-to-wear wedding outfits get face time on the tube and Tyra Banks is the new Sally Jesse Raphael. I don't see a new Balenciaga, Dior or Givenchy emerging from this tasteless morass. Do you?  Suzanne D'Amato: While I agree that most of the dresses last night were pretty lackluster, I don't think that fashion is "over" by any means. Young designers such as Proenza Schouler, Derek Lam, Sari Gueron and Thakoon Panichgul are absolutely amazing. They may not be at Tom Ford's level yet, but give 'em a few years!  _______________________  Vienna, Va.: Did anyone else notice how, um, altered Felicity Huffman's face looked? I almost didn't recognize her.  Suzanne D'Amato: Hmm, I didn't really notice -- I think her cut-down-to-there dress was what caught my attention (and not in a good way). Chatters? Any thoughts?  _______________________  Washington, D.C.: OK, I don't get it. So many otherwise-gorgeous women were wearing flesh-colored lipstick that made their mouths seem to disappear. It looked awful! Why is that the style this year?  Suzanne D'Amato: I'm assuming they wanted to match their dresses (a lot of nude-toned frocks this year!) but I completely agree. Especially when so many Hollywood types get their lips beefed up with injections...that puffy, flesh-tone lip just looks wrong. Michelle Williams was one star who went with classic red -- and looked stunning for it.  _______________________  Washington, D.C.: Everyone seems to be raving about Jennifer Lopez's dress. Was I the only one that hated it? I like the train, but thought the sweetheart neckline was unflaterring and the color was awful on her.  Suzanne D'Amato: I thought it had a classic, old-Hollywood cut that suited her figure well. And while I didn't love the color, after all of the black and nude on everyone else it was kind of refreshing. Chatters, any thoughts?  _______________________  Broadway, Va.: Who do you think wore the best gown of the evening?  Suzanne D'Amato: Michelle Williams, without a doubt.  _______________________  District Heights, Md.: In all the early morning news shows remarks about best dressed women not one mentioned Jada-Pinkett-Smith ... her outfit was dead on ... without question ... yet Naomi Watts and others got tons of coverage ... Give me a break  Suzanne D'Amato: The dresses of nominees and presenters tend to get more attention in general, but I agree that Jada looked lovely. Great color, and she's in such amazing shape, she pulls off the strapless look beautifully.  _______________________  Cleveland Park, D.C.: Charlize is the prettiest thing in Hollywood, but who the heck dresses her? It looked like one of those overstuffed penguins had nested on her shoulder. Don't distract from that face, CT! Please.  Suzanne D'Amato: Charlize is gorgeous, but yes -- it looked like she had brought a little pillow with her in case the ceremony ran long.  _______________________  Dallas, Tex.: Let's give props to Meryl Streep, who ditched her usual matronly gowns for something fitted and lovely. AND she was hysterical ...  Suzanne D'Amato: I agree. An actress who is so talented, and so comfortable in her own skin, can't help but look incredible...  _______________________  Washington, D.C.: I know it wasn't the "real" Oscars, but what the heck was Rachel McAdams thinking?  Suzanne D'Amato: This was a major topic of discussion at the Oscar party I attended! On the one hand, actresses tend to play it so safe that you don't want to diss anyone who tries something different. On the other hand...what WAS she thinking?? It looked like she'd spilled a tube of glitter all over the front of her dress.  _______________________  Washington, D.C.: I thought Michelle Williams looked amazing. Mustard is a difficult color to pull off, but it seemed to work perfectly for her and was a welcome relief from all the nude dresses on the red carpet. The fact that almost half of the women came in nude makes me think that the fashion consultants are more concerned with trend than what actually looks good on their clients. There's no way I'd ever let a pale blond wear nude -- it completely washes you out.  Suzanne D'Amato: I couldn't agree more. Two words that speak to your latter point? Nicole Kidman.  _______________________  Richmond, Va.: Best -- Michelle William and Ziyi Zhang  Worst -- Naomi Watts, Nicole Kidman, Charlize Theron  Just damned odd -- J. Lo  Suzanne D'Amato: Thoughts, chatters? I'd agree with you for the most part, though I always have a soft spot in my heart for Naomi Watts.  _______________________  Michelle Williams Fan Club, D.C.: There was Mrs. Ledger, and there was everyone else.  (J-Lo looked classy for once, though she loses points for staying too long in the Mystic tan bed.)  Suzanne D'Amato: Most actresses seem to have gotten the bronzer under control -- J. Lo and Sandra Bullock being two notable exceptions last night.  _______________________  Dallas, Tex.: Nicole Kidman has been wearing nude for years now. Why doesn't someone tell her?  Suzanne D'Amato: I'm not sure. She's beautiful, but with her skinny, skinny frame, stick-straight hair, tight dress, pale skin...it's all a little severe, in my opinion!  _______________________  Bring back the crazies: I miss Bjork and her swan dress. Everyone was safe and blah. Boring.  Suzanne D'Amato: Yes, I think that if I had one overall criticism, it's that everyone played it too safe. Of course, maybe they were just trying to protect themselves from the snarky comments of people like us!  _______________________  Washington, D.C.: I loved Keira Knightley's gown and hair. I just wished she hadn't ruined the neckline with that heavy piece of jewelry!  Suzanne D'Amato: I liked Keira's gown, but she's so young and lovely, she doesn't need all of that heavy eye makeup. As for the necklace...still not sure what I think. Chatters?  _______________________  Arlington, Va.: What was up with Larry McMurtry showing up to the Oscars in jeans, and an ill fitting jacket, shirt and bow tie that looked decades old? I know he's got a bunch of money, and that these aren't his first big awards: I have a ton of his books, and Lonesome Dove, which won a million Emmys, on DVD?  Suzanne D'Amato: Actually, I loved it! There are always a few people who "dare" to show up at the Oscars looking like themselves, and on a night where everyone's manicured, groomed and styled to death, that's a powerful statement.  _______________________  Dresses ...: I may be in the minority here, but I loved Reese Witherspoon's dress. It had classic lines, but the sort of ribboned look and the crystals (or whatever the shiny stuff was!) added a lot of interest.  I don't know, I really liked it.  Suzanne D'Amato: Reese looked so incredible in "Walk the Line" that I found that dress was a little disappointing. It's that whole blonde/nude gown thing. Chatters, what did you think?  _______________________  Washington, D.C.: Salma Hayek looked beautiful in her blue gown!  Suzanne D'Amato: The shot of color really stood out in a sea of black and nude, no?  _______________________  Man's point of view: Too many skinny women in dresses that made them even skinnier. Two words: Salma Hayek.  Suzanne D'Amato: Some of those clavicles were downright scary, no?  _______________________  Washington, D.C.: What's up with all the dresses with pockets? Did my mom design these?  Suzanne D'Amato: Actually, this is a really interesting trend, both in high and mass market fashion. I don't want to give anything away but...keep an eye out for some answers in the next edition of Sunday Source!  _______________________  washingtonpost.com:  Fashion Shots  _______________________  Herndon, Va.: Despite what everyone else may be saying, I thought George Clooney looked very cute in his tuxedo.  Suzanne D'Amato: Wait...what's everyone saying? I thought he looked great! The man has got that Cary Grant look down to a science.  _______________________  Potomac, Md.: Forget about the boring dresses. What is up with the guys? It seems that in years past the male attendees were willing to take a 'few' fashion risks. They all seem stuck in the same boring penguin costume! Did any of the men's outfits strike you as showing any creativity (leaving out distinctive glasses a la Nicholson and Terrence Howard)?  Suzanne D'Amato: Not really. Some ill-fitting tuxes, some oddly loopy and/or droopy bow ties (looking at you, Jake G)...other than that, there wasn't much that spoke to me. Chatters?  _______________________  Tysons, Va.: I think Salma Hayek was the best dressed. I loved the shoulder straps. Too bad none of the blondes chose a color like that!  Suzanne D'Amato: I though the shoulder straps were a bit too tricky -- with a color like that (and a figure like hers) simple spaghetti straps would have worked perfectly. But she did look great, no doubt about it.  _______________________  Re: Keira's Necklace: She is a beautiful little slip of a thing. A necklace that big needed someone older and with more ... amplitude to wear it. I thought it would have looked fantastic on Queen Latifah, for example.  Suzanne D'Amato: That's true. In a way it reminded me of Mary-Kate Olsen, with her gargantuan bangle bracelets and sunglasses...and that wee little frame. Queen Latifah would have rocked Keira's necklace, no doubt, but I loved that she wore so little jewelry.  _______________________  Louisville, Ky.: I loved Rachel Weisz hair and even dress, but it was too similar to Catherine Zeta-Jones Oscar night dress.  Suzanne D'Amato: Wow, you're *really* paying attention, aren't you? That comparison would never have even occurred to me.  _______________________  Washington, D.C. : Michelle Williams looked gorgeous and the dress was great. The color was not. Do you think we'll see a move away from the Hollywood stylist soon? You can spot a Rachel Zoe client a mile away and it's really dull, dull, dull.  Suzanne D'Amato: I doubt we'll see a move away from the Hollywood stylist anytime soon. Everyone is just so image-obsessed these days: Style can really kick-start a career (how else to account for the success of someone like Sienna Miller?) and the opposite -- showing up somewhere looking "bad" -- can subject you to weeks of ridicule. So most actresses view getting dressed as a job; It's important for them to get it right.  _______________________  Washington, D.C.: I thought Amy Adams looked lovely -- beautiful dress, plus her hair and makeup were simple and elegant. Not only that, but she seemed so darn nice.  Suzanne D'Amato: She looked natural, which on a night like this can be the hardest thing of all. Not to mention, she actually seemed like she was having fun!  _______________________  Alexandria, Va.: What was Naomi Watts thinking? Her "gown" was nothing more than wads of frayed fabric. Can Jennifer Aniston wear any color besides black? And she sure did seem kind of testy to me last night. I wish someone had told Felicity how awful her cleavage looked, especially after Sheryl Crow's recent chest mishap. Keira's dress was gorgeous but her necklace was too heavy. I loved Sandra Bullock's pockets but her hair looked like a rat's nest. Witherspoon? Eh. Amy Adams, Michelle Williams, and Salma Hayek looked great. But overall, the celebs dressed better for the Golden Globes.  Thanks for letting me get that off my chest!  Suzanne D'Amato: That's why we're here. Thanks for your input!  _______________________  Washington, D.C.: While the fashion may not have been as extravagant this year, there were some women who clearly stood out: Amy Adams, Reese Witherspoon, who finally chose a dress that looked terrific on her, and Jada Pinkett-Smith in the bright blue.  Suzanne D'Amato: There were some standouts, no doubt. And there were also a number of women who weren't part of the ceremony, but who also looked great -- like Mrs. P-S.  _______________________  Guys fashion: What about those fabulous Wallace and Gromit bow ties -- including the matching bow ties for the Oscars? It was so appropriate for their movie and their personalities -- they get my vote for best-accessorized men!  Suzanne D'Amato: Yes, I liked that too. Sometimes when you're not so concerned about capital-F "fashion" the result is a lot more fun!  _______________________  Suzanne D'Amato: Thanks for your great questions, everyone! I hope you had as much fun as I did.  _______________________  Editor's Note: washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over Live Online discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions. washingtonpost.com is not responsible for any content posted by third parties.
