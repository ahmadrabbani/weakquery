The Best and Worst of Oscar Fashion Simon Doonan names the 10 most noteworthy looks of the night. By  Simon Doonan   | Posted Sunday, Feb. 27, 2011, at 9:58 PM ET          Tweet                   Watching pampered movie actors presenting each other with awards and blowing hot air up each other's skirts is borderline unbearable. I alleviated the proctology by inaugurating my own system of awards.     The chic-est girl-of-the-night-award : Amy Adams in her clingy high-necked L'Wren Scott and giant Cartier bauble and bracelet. It was an old-school Lauren Bacall moment.         Gwynny also looked pretty good in that silver Calvin Klein number.        The spiffiest bloke-of-the-night-award : Russell Brand in his matchy black was the only standout in a sea of conventional tuxes.            The great-but-so-high-fashion-it-will-definitely-get-pilloried-by-Joan-Rivers award : Cate Blanchett in her strangely fabulous Givenchy.    The old-broad-still-rocking-it award : Sharon Stone in her feather-trimmed whoever-that-was.         The you're-much-too-young-to-look-so-conventional award : Jennifer Lawrence channeling Angie Dickinson circa 1980 in her unimpeachable Calvin Klein sheath.        The maybe-my-boobs-are-tattooed award: Delicious Mila Kunis in her lacey Elie Saab.
