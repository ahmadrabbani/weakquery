Leo had to be bleeped during the live Oscars broadcast when she used the F-word during her acceptance speech. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson)          LOS ANGELES — Melissa Leo won the supporting-actress Academy Award on Sunday for her role as the domineering matriarch of a boxing family in "The Fighter and her acceptance speech has been one of the hottest post-Oscar talking points. Network censors bleeped Leo for dropping the F-word during her speech. Backstage at the Kodak Theatre, Leo jokingly conceded it was "probably a very inappropriate place to use that particular word." "Those words, I apologize to anyone that they offend. There is a great deal of the English language that is in my vernacular," Leo said. But the Oscars, being a global affair, were telecast elsewhere in the world with Leo's words uncensored. Viewers who watched the show on Star Movies, a major channel available throughout Asia, heard the F-word loud and clear. Leo's win capped an unusual career surge in middle age for the 50-year-old actress, who had moderate success on TV's "Homicide: Life on the Street" in her 30s but leaped to big-screen stardom in her late 40s, a time when most actresses find good roles hard to come by. Some in Hollywood had speculated that Leo might have undermined her Oscar chances with self-promoting ads she ran in film trade papers. Such self-hype is considered tacky by some awards voters. Leo's choice of post-win vocabulary and Oscar fashions are among the topics of today's most popular online videos.
