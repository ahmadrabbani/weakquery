I am taking account that the resource is from Wikipedia<br />But according to it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousimar_Palhares" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rousamir Palhares Is fighting Hector Lombard at UFC 127</a> <br />I am going to believe this is not at all confirmed, i am just wondering if anybody even knows if Lombard is in talks of a contract?

And evidently said mention of Lombard fight has been removed from the page, if it ever was there. Although kudos to whoever did put "Paul Harris" as one of his other names.<img src="/forums/i/mi/8.gif" alt="" />

The problem isn't wikipedia itself.  There is plenty of good information to be gained off a site like Wikipedia.  The problem is that facts aren't backed up from other sources by the researchers to prove that what they read on Wikipedia was, in fact, fact.  <br /><br />I think it's asinine for anyone to say that Wikipedia can NEVER be a good source.  You just have to be diligent about your research and make sure you're not listing something that was completely pulled out of someone's ass.  As a matter of fact I would challenge people to question the sources they pull from in books or magazine just as much as they question Wikipedia.

As Achilles was stating, it's that they often aren't primary sources. You're completely right, Jackelope, Wikipedia can be a very good launching point for getting your research going and verifying sources, however, it's not a primary source. <br /><br />Teaching student to delineate between that which can be cited and that which can be used to help with your research is the biggest problem that instructors have. Often times they are not clear about what makes a primary source or a secondary source. <br /><br />Most students these days will consider a work cited in another scholarly work a primary source when, in fact, it's a refereed secondary source. It's about knowing how to check other's references and verify that you can eventually prove that it is a primary source. <br /><br />Most students can't or won't do this. <br /><br />Also, the biggest problem with Wikipedia, as compared to books and magazines, is that anybody can change the information at any time on Wikipedia. Once you purchase a book or magazine you have a tangible object that cannot be changed. This does not mean that the information you receive in a book or a magazine is correct by any stretch of the imagination. <br /><br />Most of the books written by David Irving on the subject of the Holocaust were, at one time, considered scholarly works that were taught in classrooms across all academic levels. Nobody bothered to check the veracity of his claims until Deborah Lipstadt began digging a little and called him a Holocaust denier. This led to a trial where famous historian Richard J. Evans began to examine EVERY source that Irving had ever cited and proved in a court of law that he had, indeed, plagiarized and was a Holocaust denier. Not even two years prior to this trial this man's "authority" on the events of the Holocaust were considered good enough to teach American students. There's a book written by the man who proved Irving was a liar during this entire saga called Lying About Hitler by Richard Evans. <br /><br />So, yes, students should check everything. For the record, though, most college professors do not consider magazine any more acceptable in a paper than a Wikipedia reference.

i got banned from contributing to wikipedia a few years back when everyone could just add what they wanted to topics because i happen to have the same name as a little known baseball player and changed the article.   i just put some stuff in there about me like "possibly the greatest man ever to live, definitely the greatest most that know him have ever met" and just random accomplishments that no one could have ever done.   needless to say, from then on i knew not to believe anything on there without checking into it further.
