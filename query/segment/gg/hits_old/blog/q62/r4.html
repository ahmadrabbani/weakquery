      <font face="Verdana" size="2">Many educators and editors are leery of 
      Wikipedia because students and less experienced writers use it as a 
      primary source, rather than as a compendium of background information that 
      needs to be checked and confirmed before being included in an article or 
      essay.<br>
      <br>
      It also seems to be a temptation to plagiarists. Some journalists have 
      been found to include large blocks of Wiki­pedia text, verbatim, in work 
      under their bylines, raising doubts about their commitment to 
      fact-checking, reporting and writing, as well as honesty.<br>
      <br>
      Even if a writer is clever enough to rewrite the Wikipedia text into her 
      own words, the &quot;facts&quot; have not been checked. The articles on Wikipedia 
      are in most cases not written by experts in those fields (in fact, real 
      experts are forbidden from quoting their own work on Wikipedia), and it is 
      impossible to know for sure which bits in the lifted material are correct 
      and which are not. This undermines the purpose of writing academic or 
      journalistic articles: to convey accurate information to the reader.<br>
      <br>
      In the United States, some high schools have blocked their students from 
      accessing Wikipedia, others are trying to teach pupils how to use it as a 
      general resource along with more reliable, primary material. At 
      universities, professors are warning their students about relying upon 
      Wiki­pedia. These educators are concerned because they want their students 
      to learn correct information and concepts, not incorrect ones. They also 
      want them to learn to be discerning, to ask, when they read: &quot;Who says so? 
      And does the person who is saying so have enough knowledge or experience 
      that I should rely on it?&quot; Wikipedia does not supply this information.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I think what is more important than banning resources that a student 
      might or might not use is helping students to understand how to make 
      critical judgments about the resources they uncover,&quot; Sandra Jordan, 
      associate provost of Murray State University in Kentucky, was quoted as 
      saying in an article in the school newspaper about professors' concerns 
      with Wikipedia. The April 6, 2007 Murray State News article, by Emily 
      Wuchner, also quoted student Tyler Moore as saying he still uses the site 
      for background information. But he has learned from his teachers to search 
      out research-based articles that have &quot;actual sources and references and 
      citations in them.&quot; When he first started using Wikipedia, he said, &quot;I 
      thought I could trust all of the information that was on the site. I 
      didn't really know that anyone could go in and just modify or change it, 
      so I took all of the information as being correct.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      There is a problem with inaccurate postings like the hoax article about 
      the &quot;Upper Peninsula War&quot; between Canadians and Americans, complete with 
      maps and &quot;historical photos.&quot; This war never happened, yet the article 
      remained on Wikipedia for two weeks. Articles on obscure topics receive 
      less monitoring from Wikipedia checkers.<br>
      <br>
      Other problems have arisen when companies, organizations, governments, 
      groups and individuals write their own Wikipedia entries (which the site 
      says it does not allow), when they &quot;edit&quot; articles written by others to 
      make themselves look better, or &quot;correct&quot; articles on their opponents to 
      make them look worse.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Young and old alike often go to Wikipedia and see that its name ends in 
      '-pedia',&quot; says Andy Carvin (http://www. andycarvin.com/archives) in his 
      blog on Internet culture.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;They assume it's just like any other encyclopedia and they should take 
      its content as vetted, accurate information, which ain't always the case.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <b>WIKI FACTS</b><br>
