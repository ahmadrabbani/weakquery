  Advice for Better Academic Writing</b></font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Provide a good introduction: it sets the theme, entices the reader, and tells 
    what lies ahead. An insightful first sentence/thesis statement can provide your essay with a good opening and sharpen the reader's attention. However, carefully craft this initial sentence to directly introduce your main question or topic.  Avoid overly general statements/platitudes about cities, urbanism, human nature, etc. that are not specifically linked to your theme. (For example, avoid an opening sentence such as &quot;Humans and cities are interactive, and neither can exist without the other.&quot; or &quot;Sustaining a livable planet is the most important goal of humanity, even more important than equity or growth or historic preservation.&quot;)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Be sure that the reader quickly 
    understands your main question (the "research question"), how you will address 
    the question, and your answer to the question. </font> 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When writing about a book or article, 
    provide more than just a summary of issues. Instead, write a close reading analysis, 
    interpretation, critique, or comparison. You may first need to summarize the 
    text, but then step back and take an intelligent, critical look at the text 
    and set it in the larger context of writings on cities and planning. </font> 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But be sure to not go to the other 
    extreme by simply writing a freewheeling list of your opinions. Writing just 
    from experience has its place, but that is not the focus of this course; the 
    function here is to write critically from the readings. (This shift away from 
    either simple summaries or experiential thought-pieces represents the shift 
    from high school to college writing.) </font> 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pay close attention to your writing 
    "voice." Avoid both stiff, academic-sounding language and overly informal "colloquial" 
    language. One effective approach is to use your first-person voice to introduce 
    the topic and questions, then step back and have the various cited authors present 
    their competing arguments, and then conclude by returning to the first person 
    to summarize and critique. </font> 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Avoid unnecessary use of passive 
    voice; it often muddles the issue of agency (i.e., who said or did what) and 
    makes sentence structures unnecessarily complicated. <i>An example of passive 
      voice</i>:<i> </i>&quot;Automobile manufacturing jobs in Detroit have been greatly 
    reduced since 1950.&quot; <i>Better</i>: &quot;Automation and industrial decentralization 
    have greatly reduced automobile manufacturing jobs in Detroit since 1950.&quot;<br>
    Also: do not go out of the way to avoid using first-person voice just to sound 
    &quot;objective.&quot; <i>An example of passive voice</i>: &quot;it is argued 
    that suburban residents participate less in civic organizations.&quot; <i>Better</i>: 
    &quot;I argue that suburban residents participate less in civic organizations.&quot; 
    (or, if you want to avoid using &quot;I&quot;, you might try: &quot;This paper 
    argues that suburban residents participate less in civic organizations.&quot;)</font> 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keep your writing focused: don't 
    give a lot of background and history at the beginning without it clearly supporting 
    your main points. Show the reader why the march through a couple of pages of 
    background/history is useful. Otherwise it reads like meandering. </font> 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Avoid over-generalizations without supporting documentation (e.g., "cities were 
    horrible places to live until the 20th Century..." or "...suburbs are uniformly 
    sterile, racist, boring places....").</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Give your writing a clear, organized 
    structure. Don't just write what is in your head: you can start that way (the 
    exploratory stage of writing), but you then need to restructure and edit for 
    clarity and continuity. Your ideas are only as logical, clear and strong as 
    your writing. (The transition from undergraduate to graduate papers includes 
    the shift from writing a single last-minute version that only the professor 
    sees to writing a series of drafts that are read by many people). </font> 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simplify your writing: you don't 
    need complicated, awkward sentence structures to express complex ideas. Be straightforward, 
    but without losing any subtlety. </font> 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Provide good transitions between 
    ideas. Let the reader know when you are moving from one idea to another (with 
    transitional sentences, and perhaps with section headings). Show the connection 
    between ideas. Develop a systematic, cumulative argument. </font> 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If your academic writing seems 
    rusty, take a look at Howard S. Becker, <i><a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&bookkey=256908">Writing 
      for Social Scientists: How to Start and Finish Your Thesis, Book, or Article</a></i>. 
    (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007). It is a fun, informal and often 
    helpful guide. </font> 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Double-space your text, include 
    page numbers, and use adequate margins.</font> 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, show your sources. Citations 
    aren't just a boring, pedantic academic ritual: they let the reader double-check 
    your facts, and reveal your sources and intellectual influences.<b> All source 
      materials -- whether directly quoted or summarized -- must be properly documented

        Specific Advice for Writing Papers that Analyze and Critique Urban Theory
/ Planning Theory Writings</b></font></font>
<p>1. If you are responding to a rather broad question, you might be able to
   write a more effective essay by narrowing the focus of your analysis. Be sure,
  however, to still address the central theme of the original question. Possible
  ways to narrow a question: explicitly identify several elements of a question
  and then state your intention of focusing on a subset of these elements; limit
  the answer geographically (e.g., just U.S.), temporally (e.g., late
  20th century), or by discipline (e.g., a sociological interpretation as opposed
  to a design or economic interpretation; etc.). Give the reader a clear sense
  of the direction and structure of the paper on the first page, including any
  narrowing assumptions you make.
<p>2. For  a theory paper,  keep your focus on ideas, concepts, and intellectual
  history. Use cases / examples where appropriate to illustrate your points,
  but remember that this is NOT primarily an empirical, case study-based exercise.</p>
<p>3. Find the right balance between providing a concise synopsis of the various
  authors' ideas and offering your own critique/interpretation. Your job is neither
  to simply summarize the readings (too descriptive) nor to simply write an untethered
  thought-piece on planning and cities (too idiosyncratic). Find the happy middle
  ground through a close reading and analysis of the texts.</p>
<p>4. Should one cite class lectures?  Normally for academic writing one should
  refer to the literature (rather than class lectures). The logic here is that
  the class readings (and any outside readings) constitute the substantive &quot;evidence&quot; for
  your paper's analysis; the class lectures are primarily to enliven this material,
  highlight the main themes, and place the readings in context. As a result,
  you should emphasize class readings. Of course, if there were substantive ideas
  or interpretations presented in class that were not directly from the readings,
  then do cite the lecture rather than the literature.</p>
<p>5. Finally, what makes a strong paper? (I am sure different instructors will
  give a variety of answers.) Here are some selected characteristics
  of strong versus not-so-strong papers. They are in no particular order, and
  may be somewhat redundant:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>STRONG POINTS:<br>
    Rigorous, analytical, smart writing; systematic development of arguments; clearly
      written; thoughtful and wise; clearly organized; probing; ambitious and successful;
      insightful; nicely combines synopsis of authors' ideas with his/her own critique;
      good use of literature (both assigned and outside readings); good use of
      examples; good use of transitions between ideas (and sections of the paper);
      conveys well both the important points and the nuances in the various authors'
      ideas; strong, crisp conclusion that nicely ties the paper together. Analytical
      (said twice, but it's important!); a pleasure to read; good, solid introduction.
      makes useful distinctions between ideas.</p>
  <p>SHORTCOMINGS:<br>
    simplistic and descriptive without analysis; somewhat misses the broader
      scope of the question; unsubstantiated overgeneralizations/assertions;
      overly colloquial writing; unstructured; polemical; meanders; off topic;
      conflates different topics/ideas; uses quotes without citations; Muddled
      logic; cover a few basics, but didn't really dig into the question; doesn't
      define ambiguous terms; ideas somewhat disjointed; sets up a nice paper
      structure in the introduction but doesn't deliver; needs to do a closer
      reading of the source texts; choppy writing; too vague; Forces false dichotomies;
      relies too much on one text/author when the question requires a broader
      range of ideas and sources; didn't copy edit paper.</p>

         Proper Citations</b></font><br>
  The purpose of citations is: <br>

<p><strong><a name="wikipedia"></a>AND A NOTE ON CITING (OR NOT CITING) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">WIKIPEDIA</a>:
</strong>
<p>Wikipedia  falls into a &quot;gray zone&quot; of sources.  It is a remarkable and innovative web-based project, and is notable for its breadth of information, timeliness, easy access, and largely voluntary authorship. That said, it does not (yet) fit into the category of acceptable scholarly source materials (e.g., refereed/peer-reviewed journals, books from academic presses, etc.). This is NOT to say that wikipedia articles are necessarily less &quot;true&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; than traditional sources. Wikipedia pages are generally better than random web pages, and Wikipedia does have a rather interesting and fairly good editorial policy. But for academic papers, I would not recommend citing Wikipedia (just as I would not recommend citing an encyclopedia).  
<p>Wikipedia seems best when covering relatively non-controversial topics where its volunteer authors are deeply knowledgeable about the subject (e.g., the history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html">html</a>) -- these articles are reviewed/edited by many authors.   Wikipedia is more problematic in at least two areas:  (a) obscure topics (where a single author uploads material with little collaboration/feedback), and (b) controversial topics where ideological battles trump rigor and balance (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide">Armenian Genocide</a>). (These latter sites are often <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Semi-protection_policy">locked</a> to outside editing, since such sites are often vandalized:<br>

  My advice to students: I encourage you to use Wikipedia as a quick, first stop to get up-to-speed on a topic, but NOT as a definitive or best source.   Wikipedia has a stated requirement that authors  &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About#Wikipedia_content_criteria">verify</a>&quot; their entries with sources.   Use Wikipedia as an intermediary to find these primary sources, rather than using Wikipedia as an end in itself.     (When a student cites Wikipedia in a paper, I ask them to instead find this pre-existing source.)   In the end, I would recommend NOT using Wikipedia as a source in a student paper.

       The Problem of Plagiarism</b></font> 
<p>Plagiarism is &quot;intellectual theft&quot;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><sup>2</sup> 
  </font>and is a serious matter. It is the responsibility of each student to 
  understand the problem of plagiarism, and there is no excuse or tolerance for 
  plagiarism among university student work. Plagiarism can be cause for failing 
  an assignment, failing a class and/or expulsion. 
Though the nature of intellectual property has become more complex in an era of electronic sources, the fundamental principles of academic integrity remain: cite your sources, give credit where credit is due, and enable your readers to confirm the sources and materials you use in your work. 
<p>All scholarly work is effectively a dialogue between 
the existing literature (past and present) and the writer. Citing the literature is  not a sign of derivative, unoriginal thinking, but rather an appropriate, necessary acknowledgment of this engagement between your own thinking and the ideas of others.   
<p><strong>When should one cite sources?</strong><br>
  You must acknowledge all sources and enclose all direct quotes in quotation 
  marks. This not only applies to text, but also to data, data tables and charts, 
  maps, and any other source material. Use proper citation formatting, including 
  page numbers (see <a href="#citation">above</a>). Even if you just summarize 
  ideas from another author, be sure to cite. (It is NOT sufficient to simply 
  have the source material listed in the bibliography; you must use citations 
  within the text itself.) 
<p><strong>Paraphrasing/Summarizing:</strong><br>
  If you directly quote text, then put in quotation marks and cite. If you instead 
  would like to paraphrase an outside source, it is NOT sufficient to simply rearrange 
  or substitute a few words from the quote and present as your own writing. Summarizing 
  other people's work requires a comprehensive rethinking and reinterpretation 
  in your own language and wording. There should be no confusion or ambiguity 
  as to what text, ideas, data and illustrations are those of the student versus 
  those of an outside (and clearly identified) source. 
<p><strong>Source Format and Citations:</strong><br>
  You must also cite <b>all</b> sources regardless of the source format. This 
  includes not just books and articles (both those assigned on the syllabus and 
  other materials you find), but also anything found on the <strong>Internet</strong> 
  (regardless of whether the Internet source is an electronic journal, a report 
  from a research institute, a personal home page, a newspaper, the web site of 
  a nonprofit organization, etc.). Cutting-and-pasting text from the web is technically 
  easier than typing in a quote from a published, bound book; nevertheless, the 
  former has the same citation requirements as the latter. (Do not therefore confuse 
  &quot;public access&quot; with &quot;public knowledge&quot;.) Cutting-and-pasting 
  text from the web (without proper and complete citation) is NO substitute for 
  proper academic writing, and can easily lead to failing a class, or worse. (See 
  information <a href="#electronic">above</a> about citing electronic sources.) 
<p><strong>To summarize: </strong><br>
  When in doubt, cite the source(s). If you borrow actual text (be it a phrase, 
  a sentence, or more), you MUST not only provide a complete source, but also 
  put the text in quotes. This applies to both printed and electronic sources, 
  including any and all materials found on the Internet. Using text from the web 
  without proper recognition of the source is not acceptable and constitutes plagiarism.

       Taking an &quot;Incomplete&quot; Grade in a Course</b></font>
<p>The  expectation is that students will complete all the requirements 
  for courses on time (following the deadlines stated in the syllabus). In exceptional 
  situations, I will consider a student's request for a temporary &quot;incomplete&quot; 
  grade (&quot;I&quot;) on the grade sheet. When the student has subsequently 
  submitted all course materials, I will evaluate the materials and fill out a 
  &quot;change of grade&quot; form and give to the College registrar. <em>Please 
  note: </em>Requests for incompletes are NOT automatic; you must request and 
  receive permission to take an incomplete <em>before</em> the end of the term. 
  Please also read these URP and Rackham requirements for incompletes below.</p>
<p>&bull;  the Urban Planning Program's policy on incompletes (source:<em> URP Bulletin 2009-2010</em>, pp. 46-6):</p>
<p>INCOMPLETES  <br>
The Urban and Regional Planning Program follows Rackham policies on the assignment  of grades (see http://www.rackham.umich.edu/downloads/publications/gsh.pdf) and  supplements those policies as follows.  Students are expected to complete all course assignments in full and on time  according to the course schedule established by the instructor. Consistent  with rackham policy, if a student fails to attend a substantial portion of course  lectures and fails to complete a substantial number of the assignments for a  course, the instructor will assign a &ldquo;No Report.&rdquo; This grade will be converted  automatically by the university to an involuntary withdrawal (ED) after the end of  a term. Students who receive an NR will be required to retake the course.  Students are occasionally hindered from completing all of the requirements of  a course because of unforeseen hardships. In that event, the instructor, at his  or her discretion, may assign a grade of &ldquo;Incomplete&rdquo; for the course. Following  Rackham policy, the instructor may assign an Incomplete only if the student  has attended and completed a substantial portion of the course lectures and  completed a substantial portion of the required work.  <br>
When assigning an Incomplete, the instructor will consult promptly with  the student to determine the nature of the student&rsquo;s hardship, establish  the remaining work to be completed, and set a reasonable deadline for its  completion. That deadline should be set as soon after the end of the term as  possible and should not exceed two months following the end of the term,  except under exceptional circumstances. The instructor will notify the student of  the work remaining and the deadline(s) for completing that work in writing, which  may be by email communications.  46  If the student completes all of the required work by the deadline, the instructor  will assign the student&rsquo;s final grade by incorporating all of the completed work.  <br>
If the student fails to complete all or part of the remaining work by the extended  deadline, the instructor will assign the final course grade based on the work  completed before the end of the term and before the extended deadline. In  either case, because the notation &ldquo;I&rdquo; remains a permanent part of the academic  record according to Rackham policy, the final grade as it appears on the  student&rsquo;s transcript will be noted, for example, as &ldquo;I B+.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&bull; the Rackham policy on incompletes (<a href="http://www.rackham.umich.edu/policies/gsh/section1/">Rackham Graduate School Academic Policies (1. General Academic Requirements and Regulations) </a> (accessed 27 Oct 2009):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>&quot;A student may receive a grade of Incomplete (&quot;I&quot;) only if the work remaining to be done for the course by the end of the semester is small and the instructor approves an extension for completing the unfinished work. The instructor must agree to this arrangement and determine a deadline for finishing the assigned work before a grade is assigned. The notation of &quot;I&quot; remains a permanent part of the academic record. When coursework is completed to the satisfaction of the instructor, the grade will appear on the transcript as, for example, &quot;I B+.&quot; The grade point average is based only on hours of coursework completed.&quot;</em></p>

            Master's Theses/Professional
      Projects </b></font> </p>
<p>The process of developing a thesis or professional project ideally starts
  before the end of your first academic year. Use the summer to develop your
  research proposal, configure a committee, and write several drafts of your
  proposal with feedback from your thesis/professional report chair. You should
  have a polished research proposal ready to be reviewed and approved by the
  URP Curriculum Committee in early September.</p>
<p>The actual writing process typically involves several iterations
  of drafts and revisions over a number of months. If you are
  planning to graduate on time, be sure to submit early drafts to your committee
  SEVERAL months before your final completion date, and submit a <strong>complete,
  penultimate </strong>version
  no later than 4 weeks before the end of classes, which will allow for enough
  time for comments and final revisions to be<strong> completed
        by the last day of class</strong>.
         Develop a specific time table for the submission of drafts and
        final versions, allowing sufficient time for comments and revisions (typically
      at least 4 weeks between versions). If you are planning to complete the
        thesis/project AFTER the end of the semester (e.g., during the summer),
        please talk with the committee chair about obtaining permission for an &quot;incomplete&quot; for
        your thesis/project credits (UP733/734).</p>
