 Aperto Networks Delivers on the Promise of WiMAX Interoperability

  Aperto Networks Delivers on the Promise of WiMAX Interoperability     9th November, 2005     Aperto Networks, a leading WiMAX systems provider serving over 200 operators in 65 countries, announced today that it had successfully interoperated with four other WiMAX equipment vendors at the WiMAX Forum's second public "plugfest" which began on October 30 and ended on November 6, in Beijing, PRC.   The event, which was co-sponsored by Cetecom, ETSI and CATR, provided WiMAX equipment suppliers the opportunity to test and interwork their respective pre-certified products and equipment in advance of final certification.   "Aperto continues its tradition of WiMAX leadership on the basis of proven results by demonstrating interoperability with four other WiMAX systems," said Aperto chairman and CEO Reza Ahy. "Aperto has been a key contributor and a founding Board member of the WiMAX Forum leadership since its inception. We have been a committed WiMAX advocate inclusive of being the Chair of the Service Provider Working Group, and an active member of the Certification Working Group, the Marketing Working Group and the Applications Working Group of the WiMAX Forum. Moreover, Aperto is a founding member and multiple Chair of IEEE's 802.16 standard, Chair of the Physical Layer in ETSI HiperMAN, a leader and major contributor to the 802.16-2004 standard, and a key advocate of the IEEE-802.16e standard. The successful Beijing public plugfest is a critical milestone accomplished towards the formal WiMAX Certification of our products by the end of 2005."   Aperto Networks shipped its WiMAX product portfolio to the CETECOM certification labs in Malaga, Spain, in August. Aperto Networks' PacketMAX(TM) products will be among the first wave of WiMAX fixed network system products to be WiMAX Forum Certified(TM) -- those that are certified as conformant to the standard and interoperable with other vendors' products.          All Material Subject to Copyright.
