Even users on the move who are connected to the Internet from their PDAs and laptops are benefited with. The products are carrier-grade, cost-effective and as well features WiMAX, says the company.   Manish Gupta, VP of marketing and alliances for Aperto Networks, and  WiMAX Forum ( News -  Alert ) board member, said, "Aperto has signed up over a dozen customers interested in deploying PacketMAX based WiMAX networks across the nation. They have been waiting for this announcement before launching commercial service."    Gupta added, "This is the final step in offering a complete solution for the lightly-licensed 3.65 GHz band. It means that many service providers can now cost-effectively compete head-to-head with larger established operators and benefit from WiMAX technology."    The FCC certified 3.65 GHZ solution incorporates: PM5000 and PM3000 base stations; and PM120/PM320 customer premises equipments (CPEs).    Since, Aperto’s Mobile WiMAX solution also offers solutions for the 2.5 GHz and 3.5 GHz bands, PacketMAX solutions have the capability to deliver the widest frequency support in the WiMAX ecosystem, said the company.     "Strategic offerings like Aperto's 3.65 GHz PacketMAX solution are vital to regional service providers who want to leverage the benefits of WiMAX," said Emmy Johnson, founder and principal analyst at Sky Light Research, in a statement. "It is expensive to secure the protections that traditionally only come with fully licensed deployments. But with PacketMAX's reputation for QoS, link optimization, and redundancy, anyone can now affordably offer carrier-grade WiMAX broadband services."    Aperto Networks is a founding board member of the WiMAX Forum, as well as a founder and lead contributor to  IEEE ( News -  Alert ) 802.16 and the ETSI-BRAN standards.   Milpitas, California-based Aperto Networks delivers voice and broadband services via IP-rich, point-to-point and point-to-multipoint networks, enabling carriers to offer a wider variety of services to more customers using less equipment.    Don’t forget to check out TMCnet’s  White Paper Library , which provides a selection of in-depth information on relevant topics affecting the IP Communications industry.
