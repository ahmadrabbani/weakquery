This line includes the new Wave-2 compliant PacketMAX 4000, the company's 1-4 sector modular Mobile WiMAX base station.     "We are proud to announce the availability of our flagship product for Mobile WiMAX," said Manish Gupta, Vice President of Marketing & Alliances at Aperto. "PacketMAX 4000 is unique in the industry in its unprecedented versatility and support for full redundancy in such a small footprint. This system is receiving extremely positive response from our customers and ecosystem partners."   By minimizing capital commitment per site, PacketMAX 4000 enables service providers to offer fixed, portable, and mobile broadband services and achieve profitability in a short period of time. At the same time, the system is highly scalable and can grow according to network coverage and capacity needs. It operates in wide array of 2.x GHz and 3.x GHz bands and supports multiple channel widths in compliance with the WiMAX Forum Wave-2 defined profiles.   PacketMAX 4000 ( www.apertonet.com ) incorporates the carrier-grade features synonymous with the PacketMAX brand. It supports redundancy of all major subsystems including power, backhaul, wireless controllers, and radios. PacketMAX 4000 also utilizes leading technology such as STC, MRC, and 2X2 or 4X4 MIMO to ensure superior service delivery for any application and subscriber segment.   PacketMAX 4000 plays a central role in enabling end-to-end Mobile WiMAX solutions that include best-of-breed subscriber units, base stations, ASN gateways, and CSN platforms-all pre-validated and pre-integrated to exploit the industry-leading features of PacketMAX.   A complete line of Wave-2 compliant subscriber units suitable for any operating environment complements the PacketMAX 4000. These include:  * PacketMAX 400 Series: Fixed outdoor gateways that couple support for the IEEE 802.16e-2005 standard with the highest system gain to provide an optimal solution for throughput-hungry businesses and enterprises.  * PacketMAX 500 Series: Self-installable desktop subscriber units that provide an alternative to DSL for all-indoor consumer environments. Integrated voice and WiFi options make the PacketMAX 500 series an elegant, single-box solution normally serviced by telephone adapters, WiFi access points, and DSL modems.  * PacketMAX 600 Series: Compact USB 2.0 subscriber devices that combine the reliability and performance of PacketMAX with the convenience of the USB form factor. The PacketMAX 600 has driver support for all popular operating systems. The unit turns any laptop or desktop with a standard USB port into a mobile broadband receiver station.  * PacketMAX 700 Series: PCMCIA and ExpressCard devices that fit into any standard laptop or PDA with a PCMCIA or Express card slot. The integrated high-gain antenna and power management features make the PacketMAX 700 a powerful ally in experiencing the joy of ubiquitous WiMAX.  "Due to the large capital investment required, operators are naturally cautious about quickly building out full-scale WiMAX networks ( www.apertonet.com )," said Caroline Gabriel, Research Director at Rethink Research. "Products like the PacketMAX 4000 give operators an intelligent, cost-effective strategy for introducing affordable Mobile WiMAX services on a pay-as-you-grow basis."   Aperto's line of PacketMAX Mobile WiMAX equipment will be on display at this week's WiMAX Forum Global Congress in Amsterdam, along with other members of the award-winning PacketMAX family. This includes the PacketMAX 5000, Aperto's 12-sector base station, the first product in the industry to be WiMAX Forum Certified and the only carrier-grade base station that can simultaneously support the IEEE802.16-2004 and IEEE802.16-2005 standards in a single chassis.
