Iddo="I will praise him"    Casiphia="silvery"    Nethinims - temple slaves assigned to the Levites and priests for service in the sanctuary   8:18 And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;     Mahli="sick"    Levi="joined to"    Israel="God prevails"    Sherebiah="Jehovah has scorched"   8:19 And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;     Hashabiah="Jehovah has considered"    Isaiah or Jesaiah or Jeshaiah="Jehovah has saved"    Merari="bitter"   8:20-30 Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name. Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered: I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents; Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold. And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers. Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD. So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.  8:31 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.  Nisan 12, two days before Passover (corresponds to April 4/5, 2001)  The timing of these events can be further clarified by looking at chapter 7 of Ezra which states:  7:7-9 And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.  First day of first month, Nisan 1 (March 24/25, 2001) everyone starts to assemble, 8:1-14  Torah portion being read that week: Exodus 35:1-40:1-38 (deals with construction of the tabernacle: gathering the material, the workmen, building the ark, the lampstand, the incense altar, burnt-offering altar, the courtyard, materials used, the priestly garments, Moses inspects the work, putting the tabernacle together, the glory of the Lord fills the tabernacle); Exodus 12:1-20 (Passover); Ezekiel 45:16-46:18 (the Prince gives offerings in Third Temple); 1 Samuel 20:18,42   After three days of the people gathering, Ezra becomes aware that there are no Levites in the group, 8:15  He sends for Ariel, Eliezer, etc., 8:16  He sends them out to get Levites and Nethinim, 8:17  They come, 8:18-20  A fast is proclaimed, 8:21  They leave Ahava on the 12th day of the first month, Nisan 12 (April 4/5, 2001)  Torah portion: Leviticus 1:1-5:26 (instructions for the offerings); Isaiah 43:21-44:23 (disobedience, idols are false gods, Israel not to be forsaken)   They arrive in Jerusalem on the 1st day of the 5th month (about 3 1/2 months after they left [day for a year?]), Av 1 (July 20/21, 2001)  Torah portion: Numbers 30:2-36:13 (rules about vows, war against Midian, 2 1/2 tribes receive their land, journeys of the children of Israel, boundaries of the Promised Land, Leverite cities, cities of refuge, each tribe inherits land that cannot be moved from one to the other)    8:32 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.  8:33 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;     Meremoth="elevations"    Uriah or Urijah="Jehovah (Yahweh) is my light (flame)"    Eleazar="God has helped"    Phinehas="mouth of brass"    Jozabad or Josabad="Jehovah has endowed"    Jeshua="he is saved"    Noadiah="meeting with Jehovah"    Binnui="built up"   8:34-35 By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time. Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.  8:36 And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.     commissions - decree, law, edict,    lieutenants - satrap, a governor of a Persian province      Encyclopaedia Judaica, CD-ROM Edition [I added everything in brackets]  Ariel  The name given to Jerusalem in Isaiah 29: 1�2,7, where God will bring distress upon Ariel, and will make her like an ariel (for meaning, see below). Ariel in this sense is probably connected with the form erellam in Isaiah 33:7, understood as the plural form arielim ("Jerusalemites"), parallel to "messengers of Shalom" (i.e., of Jerusalem; cf. Gen. 14: 18; Ps. 76:3).     [Isaiah 29:1 Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices.    Isaiah 29:2 Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.    Isaiah 29:7 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.    Isaiah 33:7-9 Behold, their valiant ones [Ariel] shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly. The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man. The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.   Isaiah 33:7-9 seems to describe Israel at this time. Those that love Jerusalem are crying because the city is in danger of being given away. The "peace process" has proven to be a farce and those that were promoting the idea of negotiations are realizing that it is impossible. The highways are abandoned to stone-throwing, bomb blasts and death. The wayfaring man--the traveller--decides to cancel his trip because of the unrest. Arafat has broken every promise he has ever made and incites his people to view the Israelites with contempt and pure hatred having mercy on none, not even the children of those he is said to represent. Lebanon has been abandoned...]   A cultic object in Ezekiel 43: 15�16, where it occurs in the forms ariel and harel. This is apparently an altar hearth superimposed upon the base of the altar, having horns at its four corners. Alternatively, it may be viewed as the top two sections of a three-tiered altar, again with the function of a hearth. This usage has been connected by some with the 'rl dwdh which Mesha of Moab dragged before Chemosh from a captured town (Mesha Stele, 1:12). It may also be connected with II Samuel, 23:20 = I Chronicles 11:22 "The two Ariels of Moab."  One of the chief men summoned by Ezra in Ezra 8:16 (cf. also Gen. 46:16; Num. 26:17). The etymology of this word is the subject of some dispute. Three principal modes of interpretation have been proposed: (a) from ari-el, "lion of God" or "Great Lion." This is the most probable derivation for the personal name in Ezra; (b) from a posited root ari, "to burn," with lamed afformative, thus meaning "hearth," similar to the Arabic iratun, "hearth"; and (c) as a loan word from the Akkadian arall-, the name for both the netherworld and the world-mountain. (In this view the altar is understood as a miniature ziggurat, which is taken to be the symbol of the world-mountain.) Regardless of the ultimate derivation of the word, the meaning of Isaiah 29:1�2 seems to be that Jerusalem, here (prophetically?) called Ariel, is to become like the altar, i.e., a scene of holocaust.
