            (&#8220;Arik&#8221;) Sharon</a>          was born at Kfar Malal on February 27, 1928. He served 
          in the <a href="/jsource/Society_&_Culture/IDFtoc.html">IDF</a> 
          for more than 25 years, retiring with the rank of Major-General. 
          He holds an LL.B in Law from the <a href="/jsource/Education/hu.html">Hebrew

           infantry company  in the Alexandroni Brigade.
           In 1953, he founded and  led the &#8220;101&rdquo;

           retaliatory operations against Palestinian

          military service in  the 1973 <a href="/jsource/History/1973toc.html">Yom
           Kippur War</a> to command an armored division.
           He led  the crossing of the Suez Canal which
           helped secure an Israeli victory  in

           with Egypt</a>.</p>
        <p align="justify">Ariel Sharon was elected to the <a href="/jsource/Politics/mktoc.html">Knesset</a>

        <p align="justify">In 1981, Ariel Sharon was
          appointed  Defense Minister, serving in this
          post during the <a href="/jsource/History/Lebanon_War.html">Lebanon

           infrastructure in <a href="/jsource/arabs/lebtoc.html">Lebanon</a>.
            In the realm of international relations,
           he was instrumental  in renewing diplomatic
           relations with the African nations  which
           had broken off ties with Israel during the <a href="/jsource/History/1973toc.html">Yom
            Kippur War</a>. In November 1981, he brought
            about the  first <a href="/jsource/US-Israel/strattoc.html">strategic
             cooperation agreement with the U.S.</a> and
             widened  defense ties between Israel and
             many nations. He also  helped bring thousands

        <p align="justify">Sharon remained in the government as 
          a minister without portfolio and then served as Minister 
          of Industry and Trade from 1984-90. In this capacity, 
          he concluded the <a href="/jsource/US-Israel/FTA.html">Free

        <p align="justify">From 1990-1992, he served as Minister 
          of Construction and Housing and Chairman of the Ministerial 
          Committee on Immigration and Absorption. Following the 
          fall of the Soviet Union and the waves of <a href="/jsource/Immigration/FSU.html">immigration 
          from Russia</a>, he initiated and carried out a program 
          to absorb the immigrants throughout the country, including 
          the construction of 144,000 apartments.</p>
        <p align="justify">From 1992-1996, he served as a member

          <a href="/jsource/arabs/egypttoc.html">Egypt</a> and 
          the <a href="/jsource/Peace/patoc.html">Palestinians</a>.

        <p align="justify">In 1998, Ariel Sharon was appointed

        <p align="justify">While serving as Foreign Minister, 
          Sharon met with U.S., European, Palestinian and Arab 
          leaders to advance the peace process. He worked mostly 
          to create and advance projects such as the Flagship 
          Water Project funded by the international community 
          to find a long-term solution to the region's <a href="/jsource/History/watertoc.html">water 
          crisis</a> and a basis to peaceful relations between 
          Israel, Jordan, the Palestinians and other Middle Eastern

        <p align="justify">Following the election of <a href="/jsource/biography/barak.html">Ehud 
          Barak</a> as Prime Minister in May 1999, Ariel Sharon 
          was called upon to become interim <a href="/jsource/Politics/LikudParty.html">Likud</a> 
          party leader following the resignation of <a href="/jsource/biography/netanyahu.html">Benjamin 
          Netanyahu</a>. In September 1999, he was elected Chairman

          Defense Committee in the <a href="/jsource/Politics/knesset.html">Knesset</a>.</p>
        <p align="justify">On September 28, 2000, Sharon
          made a visit to the <a href="/jsource/Society_&_Culture/geo/Mount.html">Temple
           Mount</a> in <a href="/jsource/Peace/jerutoc.html">Jerusalem</a>,
            the holiest place in <a href="/jsource/judaism.html">Judaism</a> to
            emphasize Israel's claim to sovereignty
            over the Temple Mount. Palestinians maintained
            that Sharon came with &ldquo;thousands of Israeli
           soldiers&rdquo; and defiled  a Muslim holy place,
           when in fact, Israel's Internal  Security
           Minister <a href="/jsource/biography/Ben_Ami.html">Shlomo
            Ben-Ami</a> permitted Sharon to visit the
            Temple Mount  only after calling Palestinian
            security chief <a href="/jsource/biography/Rajoub.html">Jabril
             Rajoub</a> and receiving his assurance
             that if Sharon  did not enter the mosques,
             no problems would arise.  Sharon did not
             attempt to enter any mosques and his 
             34 minute visit was conducted during normal
             hours when  the area is open to tourists.
             Palestinian youths &#8212; 
          eventually numbering around 1,500 &#8212; shouted
          slogans  in an attempt to inflame the situation.
          Some 1,500 Israeli  police were present at
          the scene to forestall violence.</p>
        <p align="justify">Following Sharon's Temple
          Mount visit,  the Palestinians, under the
          direction of <a href="/jsource/biography/arafattoc.html">Yasser
           Arafat</a>, launched an unprecendented wave
           of violence  and terror against Israelis,
           dubbed the &ldquo;<a href="/jsource/Peace/intifada2toc.html">al-Aksa
            Intifada</a>&rdquo; by the Palestinians
            for its association  with the <a href="/jsource/Society_&_Culture/geo/Mount.html">al-Aksa
             Mosque</a> located on the Temple Mount.
             Palestinian  leaders claim that Sharon's
             visit sparked the violence,  but on November
             7, 2000, an investigatory committee  led
             by former U.S. Senator George Mitchell
             was established  to determine the causes
             of the violence and to make  recommendations
             for calming the situation. <a href="/jsource/Peace/Mitchellrep.html">The
              Mitchell Report</a> issued in April 30,
              2001, concluded  &ldquo;the Sharon visit did
              not cuase the &ldquo;al-Aksa  intifada.&rdquo;</p>
        <p align="justify">In a <a href="/jsource/Politics/2001toc.html">special 
          election</a> held February 6, 2001, Ariel Sharon was 
          elected Prime Minister. He presented his government 
          to the <a href="/jsource/Politics/knesset.html">Knesset</a> 
          on March 7, 2001. After calling early elections to the 
          <a href="/jsource/Politics/16gov.html">16th Knesset</a>, 
          which were held on January 28, 2003, Ariel Sharon was 
          charged by the president with the task of forming a 
          government and presented his new government to the Knesset 
          on February 27, 2003.</p>
        <p align="justify">After several years of bloodshed,
          terror, and stalled peace talks with the
          Palestinians, Sharon devised a bold <a href="/jsource/Peace/sharonplantoc.html">plan</a> 
          that would ensure a higher degree of security
          for Israelis,  and improve the lives of Palestinians.
          While Palestinian 
          <a href="/jsource/Terrorism/terrortoc.html">terrorism</a> 
          against Israelis was at its peak, and going
          virtually  unchecked by Arafat and other
          Palestinian leaders, Sharon  decided that
          Israel should act unilaterally to improve
           its security situation and reduce bloodshed.
          This plan,  known as the <a href="/jsource/Peace/sharonplantoc.html">disengagement
           plan</a>, called for the complete withdrawal
           of Israeli  troops and settlers in
           the <a href="/jsource/Peace/gazatoc.html">Gaza
            Strip</a>, as well as the dismantlement
            of all <a href="/jsource/Peace/settletoc.html">settlements</a> 
          in the area, including four settlements in
           northen 
          <a href="/jsource/Peace/wbtoc.html"> Samaria</a>.
          Between August 16 and August 30, 2005,  Israel
          safely evacuated more than 8,500 Israeli
          settlers and, on September 11, 2005, Israeli
          soldiers left Gaza, ending Israel's 38-year
          presence in the area. </p>
        <p align="justify">The implementation
          of the disengagement plan was viewed as a
          success by most of the Israeli public, although
          it sparked bitter protests from ministers
          of Sharon's Likud Party, causing a party
          schism. Facing bitter infighting in Likud,
          Sharon formally resigned from the party to
          form a <a href="/jsource/Politics/sharonnewparty.html">new
           centrist party</a>, &#8220;Kadima,&#8221; or &#8220;Forward&#8221; 
          on November 21, 2005.</p>
        <p align="justify">Following the Likud Party spilt, Sharon 
          outlined the goals of his new party. One, he said, is 
          to closely follow the United States-backed <a href="/jsource/Peace/roadtoc.html">road 
          map</a> plan for peace with the Palestinians. Sharon 
          declared that there will be no more unilateral withdrawals 
          from the West Bank, and insisted that Palestinian terrorist 
          groups be disarmed and dismantled. The Kadima party 
          platform calls for &#8220;maximum security and assuring 
          that Israel be a Jewish national home and that another 
          state that shall arise be demilitarized, with terrorists 
          disarmed.&#8221;</p>
        <p align="justify">In mid-December, 2005, Sharon
          spent  two days in a hospital after suffering
          a minor stroke,  which doctors said caused
          no irreparable brain damage.  However, on
          January 4, 2006, Sharon was rushed to the
           hospital following another, more serious
           stroke. Sharon suffered a
          massive brain hemorrhage, which caused extensive
          cerebral bleeding.  </p>
        <p align="justify">President <a href="/jsource/US-Israel/bushtoc.html">George
            W.  Bush</a> said that Sharon was &ldquo;a man
            of courage  and peace,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;on behalf
            of all Americans,  we send our best wishes
            and hopes to the prime minister  and his
            family.&rdquo;</p>
        <p align="justify">Prime Minsterial duties
          were turned  over to <a href="/jsource/biography/olmert.html">Ehud
           Olmert</a>, who held a cabinet meeting on
           January 5,  2006, to signal the transfer
           of power. Olmert was subsequently elected
            Prime Minister until <a href="../Politics/electoc.html">elections</a> on March
           28, 2006.</p>
        <p align="justify">Sharon remains hospitalized
          and is not expected to recover from his illness. </p>
        <p align="justify">Ariel Sharon has been present
          at or  involved in nearly every seminal moment
          in modern Israel's  history. From pre-state
          Israel and <a href="/jsource/israel-war.html">Israel's wars</a> of  survival, to
          politics and the disengagement plan, Sharon
           has played a highly significant role in
          shaping Israel's  future. Although once considered
          a hardline politician  who was the &ldquo;father
          of the settlement movement,&#8221; and 
          a brilliant leader in the wartime, Sharon
          devoted his last years in politics to pursuing
          peace with security for Israel and its neighbors.</p>
        <p align="justify">Sharon is widowed and has two sons,
