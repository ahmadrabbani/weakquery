    -  Christian leaders called on Israel to leave this biblical city after
    a gunbattle and fire erupted Monday around the Church of the Nativity,
    site of a weeklong standoff between Israeli soldiers and armed Palestinians
    that appeared to be straining delciate relations between Israel and the
    Vatican.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The Vatican said it was following the situation with
    &quot;extreme apprehension,&quot; and trying to verify what happened. But
    it also reminded Israel of a 1993 pledge not to interfere at holy places
    and warned that it was hearing information that, if true, &quot;would lead
    to the aggravation of an already dramatic situation.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Some church officials, including a Franciscan friar who
    briefed senior Vatican officials on the situation, were less diplomatic,
    angrily accusing Israel of provoking the unprecedented violence around
    one of Christianity's holiest shrines.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>A senior Israeli army officer said two Israeli border
    policemen, wounded when they came under fire from Palestinian gunmen inside
    the compound, had thrown a smoke bomb that sparked the blaze. But the Rev.
    David Jaeger of the office of the Custodian of Catholic sites in the Holy
    Land called the pre-dawn clash and fire an Israeli attack that violates
    &quot;every canon of human decency. It shreds the credibility of the people
    who launched it.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The fire burned in a second-floor meeting hall above
    the courtyard of St. Catherine's church adjacent to the Church of the
Nativity,
    which is built over the grotto where tradition says Jesus was born. The
    blaze destroyed a piano, chairs, altar cloths and ceremonial cups belonging
    to St. Catherine's, the site of midnight Mass every Christmas in
Bethlehem.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians in the compound said an Israeli soldier
    shot and killed a Palestinian policeman, 23-year-old Khaled Syam, as he
    went to put out the fire.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The senior Israeli officer, speaking on condition of
    anonymity, said Palestinians signaled gunmen in a bell tower to fire on
    two Israeli border police manning a nearby rooftop lookout. Gunmen inside
    the compound fired rifles and threw hand grenades, and soldiers returning
    fire killed a Palestinian, he said.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>A Catholic missionary news agency in Rome quoted the
    Rev. Giovanni Battistelli, the Franciscan's top representative in the Holy
    Land, as disputing the Israeli version: &quot;Nobody opened fire from
inside
    the basilica compound. It was an attack carried out by Israeli
forces.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli forces moved into Bethlehem shortly after
beginning
    their 11-day-old offensive in the West Bank, an operation targeting
militant
    groups that have carried out terror attacks in Israel. More than 200 armed
    Palestinians, including police and militiamen, have been holed up in the
    church for a week.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Relations between the Vatican and Israel, formalized
    only in 1993, long have been sensitive, largely because of differences
    over Pope Pius XII's role during the Holocaust and the Israeli-Palestinian
    crisis. Critics of Pius maintain he failed to speak out and use his
position
    to protect European Jews from the Nazis. The Vatican, which plans to
beatify
    Pius and put him on the path to sainthood, maintains he used discreet
diplomacy
    to try to help Jews.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Leaders of other Christian denominations in the Holy
    Land have supported the Franciscans' position about the Church of the
Nativity,
    issuing a statement urging Israeli forces to &quot;go in peace&quot; from
    Bethlehem.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>But Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who also is
    under growing U.S. pressure to pull out of West Bank Palestinian cities
    immediately, told parliament Monday that soldiers would surround the church
    until the gunmen surrender.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Since it is not our aim to desecrate the sanctity
    of the place, as the murderers who took control of the spot and took the
    clerics hostage are doing, we expect the international community to demand
    that they lay down their arms and leave the holy place,&quot; Sharon told
    parliament. &quot;Until then, the (Israeli army) will remain in
position.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Franciscans, who deny the 60 clergymen in the church
    compound are hostages, said the clerics will remain in place throughout
    the standoff.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel's Foreign Ministry tried to ease the growing
anxiety
    of not only Roman Catholic leaders in Jerusalem but also those of other
    Christian denominations, meeting privately with them Monday evening.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Foreign Ministry spokesman Yaffa Ben-Ari said Israel
    initiated the meeting to &quot;find ways to alleviate the pressures of
    the situation.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>She said church leaders asked Israel not to take any
    actions that would further harm the church and that Deputy Foreign Minister
    Michael Melchior &quot;expressed the promise to make sure we will keep
    the sanctity of life and church.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Rabbi David Rosen, director of inter-religious affairs
    at the American Jewish Committee, said the situation is serious and he
    expects the Vatican is frustrated but that the threat of the church
standoff
    undermining relations appears worse than it is.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Rosen, who helped negotiate the 1993 agreement
establishing
    formal ties, said the Vatican understands that the assessment of events
    at the church compound from some of its Christian leaders in the Holy Land
    is colored by their views as Palestinians.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>About 2 percent of the 3 million Palestinians in the
    West Bank and Gaza are Christian.</FONT>
