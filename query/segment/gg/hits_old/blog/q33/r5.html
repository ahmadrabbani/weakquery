      </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">On 6 June 1982, the Israeli army invaded 
      Lebanon, in reaction to the attempted assassination of the Israeli 
      ambassador Argov in London on June 4. On the same day, the Israeli secret 
      services attributed the attempted assassination to a dissident Palestinian 
      organisation commandeered by the Iraqi government, which was then 
      concerned with deflecting attention from its recent setback in the 
      Iran-Iraq war. The long-prepared Israeli operation was christened &quot;Peace 
      in the Galilee&quot;. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Initially, the Israeli government had 
      announced its intention to penetrate 40km into Lebanese territory. The 
      military commander, under the orders of Defence Minister Ariel Sharon, had 
      meanwhile decided to execute a more ambitious project that Mr Sharon had 
      prepared several months previously. After having occupied the south of the 
      country and destroyed Palestinian and Lebanese residences there, 
      simultaneously committing a series of violations against the civilian 
      population , the Israeli troops penetrated as far as Beirut, and by 18 
      June 1982 they had surrounded the Palestine Liberation Organisation's 
      armed forces in the west side of the town. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">According to Lebanese statistics, the Israeli 
      offensive, particularly the intensive shelling against Beirut, caused 
      18,000 deaths and 30,000 injuries, mostly among civilians. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">After two months of fighting, a ceasefire was 
      negotiated through the intermediary of United States Envoy Philip Habib. 
      It was agreed that the PLO would evacuate Beirut, under the supervision of 
      a multinational force deployed in the evacuated part of the town. The 
      Habib Accords envisaged that West Beirut would subsequently be invested by 
      the Lebanese army, and the Palestinian leadership were given American 
      guarantees for the security of civilians in the camps after their 
      departure. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The evacuation of the PLO ended on 1 
      September 1982. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">On 10 September 1982, the multinational 
      forces left Beirut. The next day, Mr Ariel Sharon announced that &quot;2,000 
      terrorists&quot; had remained inside the Palestinian refugee camps around 
      Beirut. On Wednesday 15 September, after the previous day's assassination 
      of President-elect Basher Gemayel, the Israeli army occupied West Beirut, 
      &quot;surrounding and sealing&quot; the camps of Sabra and Shatila, which were 
      inhabited by an entirely civilian Lebanese and Palestinian population, the 
      entirety of armed resistors (more than 14,000 people) having evacuated 
      Beirut and its suburbs. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Historians and journalists agree that it was 
      probably during a meeting between Ariel Sharon and Bashir Gemayel in 
      Bikfaya on 12 September that an agreement was concluded to authorise the 
      &quot;Lebanese forces&quot; to &quot;mop up&quot; these Palestinian camps. The intention to 
      send the Phalangist forces into West Beirut had already been announced by 
      Mr Sharon on 9 July 1982 , and in his biography he confirms having 
      negotiated the operation during his meeting with Bikfaya. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">According to Ariel Sharon's 22 September 1982 
      declarations in the Knesset (Israeli parliament), the entry of the 
      Phalangists into the refugee camps of Beirut was decided on Wednesday 15 
      September 1982 at 15.30. Also according to General Sharon, the Israeli 
      commandant had received the following instruction: <i>&quot;The Tsahal forces 
      are forbidden to enter the refugee camps. The &quot;mopping-up&quot; of the camps 
      will be carried out by the Phalanges or the Lebanese army.&quot;</i> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">From dawn on 15 September 1982, Israeli 
      fighter-bombers were flying low over West Beirut and Israeli troops had 
      secured their entry. From 9am, General Sharon was present to personally 
      direct the Israeli penetration, installing himself in the general army 
      area at the Kuwait embassy junction situated at the edge of Shatila. From 
      the roof of this six-storey building, it was possible to clearly observe 
      the town and the camps of Sabra and Shatila. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">From midday, the camps of Sabra and Shatila - 
      in reality a single zone of refugee camps in the south of West Beirut - 
      were surrounded by Israeli tanks and soldiers, who had installed 
      checkpoints all around the camps permitting the surveillance of the 
      entrances and exits. During the late afternoon and evening, the camps were 
      bombarded with shells. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">By Thursday 16 September 1982, the Israeli 
      army controlled West Beirut. In a release, the military spokesperson 
      declared, <i>&quot;Tsahal controls all the strategic points of Beirut. The 
      refugee camps, including the concentrations of terrorists, are surrounded 
      and closed.&quot;</i> In the morning of 16 September, the following order was 
      issued by the army high command: <i>&quot;The searching and mopping up of the 
      camps will be done by the Phalangists/Lebanese army.&quot;</i> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">During the morning, shells were fired down 
      towards the camps from high locations and Israeli snipers were shooting 
      down at people in the streets. At about midday, the Israeli military 
      command gave the Phalangist militia green light to enter the refugee 
      camps. Shortly after 5 o'clock pm, a unit of approximately 150 Phalangists 
      entered Shatila camp from the south and southwest. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">At that point, General Drori telephoned Ariel 
      Sharon and announced, <i>&quot;Our friends are advancing into the camps. We 
      have coordinated their entry.&quot;</i> Sharon replied, <i>&quot;Congratulations! 
      Our friends' operation is approved.&quot;</i> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">For the next 40 hours inside the <i>
      &quot;surrounded and sealed&quot;</i> camps, the Phalangist militia raped, killed 
      and injured a large number of unarmed civilians, mostly children, women 
      and old people. These actions were accompanied or followed by systematic 
      roundups, backed or reinforced by the Israeli army, resulting in dozens of 
      disappearances. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Until the morning of Saturday 18 September 
      1982, the Israeli army, which knew perfectly well what was going on in the 
      camps, and whose leaders were in permanent contact with the militia 
      leaders who perpetrated the massacre, did not intervene. Instead, they 
      prevented civilians from escaping the camps and organised for the camps to 
      be lit up throughout the night by flares sent into the sky from 
      helicopters and mortars. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The count of victims varies between 700 (the 
      official Israeli figure) and 3,500 (notably in the inquiry launched by the 
      Israeli journalist Kapeliouk). The exact figure will never be determined 
      because in addition to the approximately 1,000 people who were buried in 
      communal graves by the ICRC or in the cemeteries of Beirut by members of 
      their families, a large number of corpses were buried under bulldozed 
      buildings by the militia themselves. Also, particularly on 17 and 18 
      September, hundreds of people were carried away alive in trucks towards 
      unknown destinations, never to return. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The victims and survivors of the massacres 
      have never received any judicial instruction, whether in Lebanon, Israel 
      or elsewhere. After 400,000 people took to the streets in protest, the 
      Israeli parliament (Knesset) named a commission of inquiry presided over 
      by Mr Yitzhak Kahan in September 1982. In spite of the limitations of the 
      commission's mandate (it was a political and not a judicial mandate) and 
      the total absence of the voices and demands of the victims, the Commission 
      concluded that the Minster of Defence was personally responsible for the 
      massacres. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Upon the insistence of the Commission, and 
      the demonstrations that followed its report, Mr Sharon resigned from his 
      post of Minister of Defence but remained in the government as Minister 
      Without Portfolio. It is worth noting that, during the 'Peace Now' 
      demonstration immediately prior to Sharon's 'resignation', demonstrators 
      were attacked with grenades, resulting in the death of a young 
      demonstrator. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Several non-official inquiries and reports 
      including those of MacBride and of the Nordic Commission, based mainly on 
      the testimony of eyewitnesses, as well as other pieces of journalistic and 
      historical research, have brought together vital pieces of information. 
      These texts, in part or in full, are annexed to this file. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">In spite of the evidence of what the UN 
      Security Council described as a 'criminal massacre,' and the sad ranking 
      of the Sabra and Shatila massacres in humankind's collective memory as 
      among the great crimes of the 20th Century, the man found &quot;personally 
      responsible&quot;, his associates and the people who carried out the massacres 
      have never been pursued or punished. In 1984, the Israeli journalists 
      Schiff and Yaari concluded their chapter on the massacre with this 
      reflection:<i> &quot;If there is a moral to the painful episode of Sabra and 
      Shatila, it has yet to be acknowledged.&quot;</i> This reality of impunity 
      remains true to this day. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The United Nations Security Council condemned 
      the massacre with Resolution 521 (19 September 1982). This condemnation 
      was followed by a 16 December 1982 General Assembly resolution qualifying 
      the massacre as an &quot;act of genocide.&quot; </p>

        He was hungry and we were far from the kitchen. My sister wanted him to 
        quieten down, and she put her hand over his mouth for fear that they 
        would hear. Her husband decided that we would have to give ourselves up, 
        adding that each person's fate was anyway preordained by God. The women 
        went out first, my brothers, my father, my brother-in-law and other 
        members of the family followed. My brother was ill. As soon as they 
        heard our voices, they shot in our direction and came straight back 
        inside the house. They asked us where we had been the day before when 
        they had come in and not found anyone there. Then they ordered the women 
        and children to go out. My brother-in-law started kissing his little 
        girl as if he were saying goodbye. An armed man came towards my niece, 
        tied a rope around her neck and threatened to strangle her if her father 
        didn't let go of her. He let go of her and gave her to me. They wanted 
        to take me too but my mother told them I was a girl. They made my mother 
        and the women walk to the Sports Centre. While I was walking I saw my 
        aunt's husband, Abu Nayef, killed near our house with blows of an axe to 
        his head. The dead bodies were disfigured. While I was carrying my 
        niece, I bumped into a dead body that had been hit with an axe and I 
        fell over. They knew then that I was a boy, and one of them put me up 
        against the wall; he wanted to fire a bullet into my head. My mother 
        begged him and kissed his feet so that he would let me go. He pushed her 
        away. When he did that, he heard the clinking of some money she had 
        hidden next to her chest. He asked her what that meant. She replied that 
        he could have all the money he wanted but he had to let me stay with 
        her. In this way we carried on our way and we arrived at the Sports 
        Centre. The Israeli bulldozers were busy digging large trenches. We were 
        told that we all had to get in because they wanted to bury us all alive. 
        My mother started begging him again, and then she asked for a mouthful 
        of water before dying. </p>

        escaped once again, towards the interior of the camp. Then, when 
        daybreak came, we hid ourselves in the shelter of the rest home. I was 
        pregnant at the time, and I had two daughters who were still taking 
        milk. We stayed in the rest home for two days, until Saturday. We didn't 
        have any more milk. My husband went out to get some for the girls. That 
        night was so long, and the Israelis were firing flares to illuminate the 
        sky. It was like this when my husband went to Sabra. The Israelis had 
        come as far as the Gaza hospital. After that, I went out to look for 
        him, and my sister went to look for her husband. We arrived at the 
        entrance to Shatila. There, they had put the men on one side and the 
        women on the other side. I started looking among all the men. I saw him, 
        and I said to him, &quot;You know, these are Phalangists.&quot; He replied, &quot;What 
        happened at Tel al Zaater will happen to us.&quot; The armed men ordered us 
        to walk in front, and the men behind. We walked like this until we 
        arrived at the communal grave. There, the bulldozer had started digging. 
        Among us was a man who was wearing a white nurse's shirt; they called 
        him and filled him with bullets in front of everyone. The women started

        hiding in the bathroom. When they [the soldiers] left the house, I

        While we were walking, we saw people who had been killed with axes. 
        Among them were doctors from Gaza hospital. They lined them up and 
        slaughtered them; then they started shooting at us and killed a large 
        number of people, including 18 of our neighbours' sons. While they were 
        shooting, the whole camp was surrounded by Israeli tanks and all the 
        diggers were Israeli. An Israeli patrol presented itself to us and asked 
        us to go to the Sports Centre. The men went, while we women were taken 
        to the Kuwait embassy. </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">That's how we saw them loading the young

        the sustained shooting. The shelling reached the main roads and we 
        didn't know what the reason for it was. It was incredible. We couldn't 
        even move from one place to another or escape because of the shells and 
        machine-gun fire. </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">We stayed at home and suddenly a shell hit 
        our neighbours' house. Some of the shrapnel hit my son in the chest and 
        the leg, and we took him to Akka hospital, but they wouldn't admit him 
        because of the large number of injured people already there. We took him 
        to Gaza hospital. My brother and I stayed with him at the hospital, but 
        the shelling of Sabra and Shatila camps intensified. A woman came to 
        tell us that she had seen them coming; I fled but I saw how they entered 
        and took away all the injured and sick people. So I escaped and I came 
        back three hours later. They had taken away many people and the only one 
        left was my injured son. I don't know how many people they took away 
        alive. </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Then we took my son to a hospital in Hamra, 
        and the next day I heard that they had come to Sabra and they had taken 
        away the girls. When I came back here I saw my daughter Fatima had been 
        hit with an axe, along with my little girl. I noticed that they had dug 
        a ditch in the ground and they had buried them alive in the ditch. The 
        baby's throat had been slit. I also saw people who had been killed and 
        pregnant women with their stomachs ripped open. About thirty young 
        people had been massacred near our house, without any distinction made 
        as to whether they were Lebanese or Palestinian. They didn't spare 
        anyone; they killed everyone they came across. In the home of our 
        neighbour Ali Salim Fayad, they had killed his wife and children. </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">My God, what can I say, what can I tell 
        you? They had demolished the shops in Sabra road and dug large ditches 
        where they had buried the victims. I saw about 400 children's corpses. 
        They upturned the earth and buried them. From the twelve members of our

        father's uncle. There, the shelling started again, and we went into the 
        bedroom, the men staying in the salon. Then we went to a neighbour's 
        house. There were about 25 or more of us. A little later, we heard the 
        cries of a girl who had been injured in the back. Armed men had 
        stationed themselves in the area. Then we heard shooting, screams and 
        strange voices. Aida, my cousin, went up to the shop and turned on the 
        light. A man slit her throat and they dragged her by her hair. She 
        started screaming &quot;Daddy!&quot; then her voice went dead. Her father wanted 
        to follow her. They killed him immediately. That's how they understood 
        that we were in the house. They came down to the floor above us, where 
        they broke and ransacked everything and we heard them calling out to 
        each other, &quot;George, Tonyโฆ&quot; When we heard them breaking everything our 
        voices rose, and that's how they knew that we were on the floor below. 
        One of them came down and saw us. He immediately told the others, and 
        they all came down. My father was sitting on a chair, and as soon as he 
        saw them, he kissed me, put some cologne on me and told my mother to 
        take good care of the children. My father's cousin said to his wife,

        looked up at the red sky, red streaked with flare grenades. Once we 
        arrived at the beginning of the road, we heard the shots aimed at my 
        father and my uncle, as well as some shouting. We walked several metres, 
        flanked by armed men. My cousin saw her father and she started 
        screaming. I saw my father's car, which they had opened and were sitting 
        in. That image is also engraved in my memory, because I asked my mother 
        what they were doing with my father's car but she didn't reply. As we 
        walked along we saw the dead people. </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">They took us to the Sports Centre, and they 
        placed us there in a room where there was a woman and her children. They 
        brought people there. They took some of them away in cars and killed the

        exploded. People fled, and we were among them. What can I say? When we 
        were at the Sports Centre, the Israelis were securing the protection of 
        the Phalangists, and Israeli tanks were stationed there. Also, it was 
        the Israelis who shouted into the loudspeakers, &quot;Give yourselves up and

        <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>On Wednesday, when the Israeli army 
        arrived at the Sports Centre with its tanks, and when we found out that 
        the Israelis were there, I went with a friend to ask them what was going 
        on. </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">They asked me if I was a terrorist, I said 
        no. Then they said to us, stay at home, there's nothing happening. I 
        went home. It was the 15th of September. </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">On Thursday 16 September, I was talking to 
        Abu Merhef and Abu Nabil when suddenly we heard the sound of bombs 
        falling on the houses, and the screams of injured people. We ran to help 
        the wounded, and to drive them the Akka and Gaza hospitals. Afterwards, 
        I suggested to my father that he go down into the shelter. The shelling 
        kept intensifying, and we went down into the shelter. The children were 
        thirsty. I went to get some water and blankets. My brother had been away 
        from the house for 15 days because of his job. He came, and stood with 
        us at the door to the shelter. Suddenly, we saw some Israelis and some 
        Phalangists coming towards us, swearing and cursing. They told us to 
        come out. We did. They placed us against the wall and pointed at Abu 
        Merhef; he had 500 pounds in his pocket. Abu Merhef told them to take 
        250 pounds and to leave him with 250 pounds for the children. When they 
        heard that, they immediately shot at the men. I was hit and I pretended 
        to be dead. Three or four others fell on top of me. They were dead - it 
        was Abu Hassan Al Bourgi, Kassem Al Bourgi, Abu Nabil and Ali Mehanna. I 
        remember that Ali Mehanna survived his injuries for at least an hour; 
        when he regained consciousness he started calling for help and asking if 
        there was anyone still alive. I said, &quot;I am,&quot; and he said, &quot;who?&quot; I 
        said, &quot;Hamad.&quot; He said, &quot;Please Hamad, I am injured in the stomach and 
        in the hand. Say hello to my mother, my sister, so-and-so, and tell them 
        Ali sends his love.&quot; I said, &quot;How do you know that I'm going to live? Is 
        there anyone else alive near you?&quot; He was sitting up and I was still 
        lying down. A little while later they came back and said to Ali, &quot;Are 
        you still calling?&quot; They insulted him and hit him on the head. But he 
        got up again and he said to them, &quot;Is that how you treat us, you sons of 
        bitches?&quot; because he thought they weren't supposed to attack Lebanese. 
        They then resumed their task, 5 or 6 times. They shot to make sure that 
        everyone was dead. They pointed the gun at my thigh and fired. In that 
        way, they had come back to make sure everyone was dead. At about five in 
        the morning, I tried to get up from where I was. There was a wall next 
        to me. I moved along the road and I heard the sound of the tanks. I went 
        to hide in the home of Osman Houhou, which had been destroyed. Suddenly 
        I heard an Israeli on a microphone saying, &quot;Give up your weapons, you 
        will have your lives spared and those of your family.&quot; </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">I tried to climb up the slope in order to 
        give myself up like they said. When I was almost there, I looked and I 
        saw them placing the men on one side and the women on the other. Then I 
        saw them shooting them. That's the reason why I went back to hide in the 
        house I had left a little while earlier. I stayed there until the 
        evening. They were sitting around a table drinking alcohol, there was 
        only a wall separating me from them. The wall was cracked; I could see 
        what was happening. They were saying to each other, &quot;don't leave 
        anything that moves.&quot; </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">In that way I remained sleeping in the 
        house until 10 o'clock on Sunday morning. I lost hope and I couldn't 
        handle any more, I decided to go out even if it meant being killed. I 
        tried to go back to our house, but I found it destroyed. I couldn't walk 
        because of all the dead people strewn over the road. And every time my 
        hand touched one of them, I found their flesh between my fingers. </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">I saw Um Bashir who had been killed with 
        her seven children. It was as if she was sleeping with her seven 
        children around her. I went back home and sat down with the dead. The 
        Makdad girl came to call for help, and that's how they took me to the 
        hospital.</i></p>

        light as day because of the illumination flares. When we got to the 
        Kuwait embassy, they took Ali, my husband's nephew, and they loaded us

        stood on a balcony and said, &quot;you're bringing me women; I want men.&quot; 
        With us was a small boy of 13, Ali Zayyoun, who was cowering in a corner 
        of the bus. As soon as they saw him, they took him and killed him. Then 
        they took us to Ouzai. The next day they asked us to go back to our 
        houses. Israeli patrols and Phalangist blockades were everywhere. The 
        ground was littered with corpses. At the door of the shelter I saw my

      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">This conclusion deserves consideration. In 
      effect, article 2 of the 9 December 1948 Convention on genocide, approved 
      by the law of 26 June 1951 , defines thus: <i>&quot;...The crime of genocide 
      accords with one of the following acts, committed with the intention to 
      destroy, whether in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or 
      religious group such as: 1) Murder of members of the group; 2) grave 
      attack on the physical integrity of members of the groupโฆ &quot;</i> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The file demonstrates that the attack against 
      the refugees at Sabra and Shatila rested upon a profound ethnic hatred of 
      Palestinians because of their national origin. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The intention to harm them was clearly driven 
      by the fact that they were Palestinians. In a book by the American 
      journalist Thomas Friedman, who was one of the first witnesses after the 
      massacre, he wrote: </p>
      <blockquote dir="ltr">
        <i>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Afterward, the Israeli soldiers would claim 
        they did not know what was happening in the camps. They did not hear the 
        screams and shouts of people being massacred. They did not see wanton 
        murder of innocents through their telescopic binoculars. Had they seen, 
        they would have stopped it immediately. </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">All of this is true. The Israeli soldiers 
        did not see innocent civilians being massacred and they did not hear the 
        screams of innocent children going to their graves. What they saw was a 
        &quot;terrorist infestation&quot; being &quot;mopped up&quot; and &quot;terrorist nurses&quot; 
        scurrying about and &quot;terrorist teenagers&quot; trying to defend them, and 
        what they heard were &quot;terrorist women&quot; screaming. In the Israeli psyche 
        you don't come to the rescue of &quot;terrorists.&quot; There is no such thing as 
        &quot;terrorists&quot; being massacred. </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Many Israelis had so dehumanised the 
        Palestinians in their own minds and had so intimately equated the words 
        &quot;Palestinian,&quot; &quot;PLO,&quot; and &quot;terrorists&quot; on their radio and television for 
        so long, actually referring to &quot;terrorist tanks&quot; and &quot;terrorist 
        hospitals,&quot; and they simply lost track of the distinction between 
        Palestinian fighters and Palestinian civilians, combatants and 
        non-combatants. The Kahan commission, the Israeli government inquiry 
        board that later investigated the events in Sabra and Shatila, uncovered 
        repeated instances within the first hours of the massacre in which 
        Israeli officials overheard Phalangists referring to the killing of 
        Palestinian civilians. Some Israeli officers even conveyed this 
        information to their superiors, but they did not respond. The most 
        egregious case was when, two hours after the operation began on Thursday 
        evening, the commander of the Israeli troops around Sabra and Shatila, 
        Brigadier General Amos Yaron, was informed by an intelligence officer 
        that a Phalangist militiaman within the camp had radioed the Phalangist 
        officer responsible for liaison with Israeli troops and told him that he 
        was holding forty-five Palestinians. He asked for orders on what to do 
        with them. The liaison officer's reply was, &quot;Do the will of God.&quot; Even 
        upon hearing such a report, Yaron did not halt the operation. </i></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">This collective &quot;demonisation&quot; of 
      Palestinians as described by Mr Friedman is also to be found in Ariel 
      Sharon's autobiography entitled 'Warrior': the objective of the attack on 
      Sabra and Shatila was <i>&quot;to clean the PLO cadres out of West Beirut.&quot;</i> 
      In another passage from the same book, Mr Sharon explains the object of 
      the invasion of Lebanon in the following terms: <i>&quot;Any effective approach 
      (โฆ) would have to look not just at specific local targets but at the 
      entire PLO military and political infrastructure in Lebanon. And this, 
      whether we liked it or not, would force us to take into account the entire 
      Lebanese tangle.&quot;</i> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">It also corresponds with the famous comments 
      uttered by the then Israeli Prime Minister referring to Palestinians as <i>
      &quot;two-legged animals,&quot;</i> and with those of Rafael Eitan, who according to 
      the Kahan commission shared responsibility for the massacre, and who spoke 
      of the Palestinians as <i>&quot;drugged cockroaches.&quot;</i> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Also on the part of those who carried out the 
      massacre, the hatred for Palestinians as a national group emerges clearly 
      from the testimony of many of the plaintiffs and survivors. If it is true 
      that a large number of Lebanese were also killed, the ethnic instigation 
      was clear in a so-called distinction between Lebanese and Palestinians. Mr 
      Adnan Ali Mekdad speaks of the conversation between his mother and the 
      torturers in this way: <i>&quot;My mother saw the armed men, made them some tea 
      and told them she was Lebanese. They told her that they were only after 
      the Palestinians, and that, being Lebanese, she could stay in the area, 
      no-one would bother her, she just had to keep her ID papers with her.&quot;</i> 
      She did not survive the massacre. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The testimony of Mohammed Ibrahim Faqih can 
      be understood in the same way: <i>&quot;About thirty young people had been 
      massacred near our house, without any distinction made as to whether they 
      were Lebanese or Palestinian. They didn't spare anyone; they killed 
      everyone they came across. In the home of our neighbour Ali Salim Fayad, 
      they had killed his wife and children.&quot;</i> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The hatred of Palestinians as an ethnic 
      group, on the part of the Israeli military command as much as the 
      Phalangist perpetrators, explains the phenomenon reported by several 
      journalists including Thomas Friedman: </p>
      <blockquote dir="ltr">
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>The Israelis had so demonised Sabra and 
        Shatila as nests of Palestinian terrorism and nothing more that they 
        didn't even know that probably one quarter of the Sabra and Shatila 
        neighbourhoods were inhabited by poor Lebanese Shiites who had come to 
        Beirut from the countrysideโฆ A picture in the As-Safir paper the day 
        after the massacre was exposed captured the blind tribal rage of the 
        Phalangists who tore through the camps. The picture, which occupied most 
        of the top of the front page, consisted of a single hand. The fingers of 
        this hand were locked around an identity card that could easily be read. 
        The card belonged to Ilham Dakir Mikdaad, age thirty-two. She was a 
        Shiite woman whose entire family, estimated to be forty individuals, was 
        wiped out by the Phalangists. Her body was found lying on the main 
        street in Shatila, with a row of bullets running across her breasts. It 
        was clear what had happened: she must have been holding up her identity 
        card to a Phalangist, trying to tell him she was a Lebanese Muslim, not 
        a Palestinian, when he emptied his bullet clip into her chest. </i></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">These conclusions are supported by the 
      notorious assertions taken up in the inquiries and reports of the time 
      about the collective dimension of the massacre (men, women and children), 
      and the particular vindictiveness against pregnant women (see for example 
      the testimonies of Mohammed Ibrahim Faqih and of Shawqat Abu Roudeina) and 
      babies. From these numerous reports and testimonies, we retain that which 
      mentions a baby being trampled to death , the assertions of Lieutenant Avi 
      Grabowski (who was present during the massacres but ignored by the 
      superiors to whom he reported what he saw ), and, especially, the 
      confirmation of the connivance between the motives of the killers and 
      those of the Israeli Minister of Defence: </p>

        and Sharon decided to evade it. &quot;I'm off to Bekfaya now,&quot; was his reply. 
        &quot;We'll discuss that at a more restricted session.&quot;</i></p>

      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">To that note, which Israeli authors qualified 
      as &quot;sinister,&quot; it must be added that, in the jurisprudence of the ICTY , 
      the &quot;specific intention of the crime of genocide does not have to be 
      clearly expressed. (โฆ) it can be inferred from a certain number of 
      elements, such as the general doctrine of the political project (โฆ) or the 
      repetition of discriminatory destructive acts (or) the perpetration of 
      acts undermining the foundation of the group. &quot; In the Akayesu case, the 
      tribunal concluded that, &quot;This intention can be deduced from a certain 
      number of elements, concerning genocide, crime against humanity and war 
      crimes, by example of the massive and/or systematic character or of their 
      atrocity (โฆ) &quot; </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">In conclusion, all the constituent elements 
      of the crime of genocide, as defined in the 1948 Convention and reproduced 
      in article 6 of the ICC Statute and in article 1ยง1 of the law of 16 June 
      1993 are present. <br>

      <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="verdana" size="4">B. CRIMES 
      AGAINST HUMANITY</font> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="verdana"><b>B1. Definition and 
      source(s) of incrimination</b></font> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">According to the Rome Statute of the 
      International Criminal Court (ICC), as approved by the law of 25 May 2000, 
      there is a crime against humanity when certain acts are committed &quot;as part 
      of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian 
      population, with knowledge of the attack&quot; (article 7.1). Article 7.2 
      specifies that the term &quot;Attack directed against any civilian population&quot; 
      means &quot;a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts 
      referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or 
      in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack.&quot; 
      It stands out from the preparatory work of the ICC Statute that the 
      definition of article 7.1, as well as the specification of article 7.2, 
      was conceived in a very broad manner. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The definition of article 7.1 was taken up 
      again in article 1 ยง2 of the law of 16 June 1993 relative to the 
      repression of grave violations of international humanitarian law, as 
      modified by the law of 10 February 1999. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">It is important to underline that in the 
      strictest sense of the term, these legislative texts do not incriminate 
      crime against humanity but confirm its preexistent incrimination. The ICC 
      Statute makes this clear in article 10. The Belgian legislator expressed 
      this clearly during the preparatory work for the law of 1999. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Once again it has been clearly shown that 
      International Customary Law and the ius cogens are the sources of 
      incrimination for crimes against humanity. Several judicial decisions have 
      explicitly confirmed this source of incrimination , including the ICTY. 
      Particularly interesting in this case are, on the one hand the decision of 
      the Israeli Supreme Court in the Eichmann case, which is explicitly drawn 
      from &quot;the Laws of Humanity&quot; and &quot;the dictates of Public Conscience &quot;, and 
      on the other hand the decision rendered by Judge Vandermeersch in the 
      Pinochet case, according to which, &quot;It is to be considered that before 
      being codified in treaties or laws, crimes against humanity are 
      established in international custom and as such fall under international 'ius 
      cogens', which is imposed in internal jurisdiction with the effect of 
      constraining 'erga omnes' &quot; </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Every definition of 'crime against humanity' 
      is thus - by definition - always incomplete. In this manner, it is 
      necessary also to be aware that the definition in the ICC Statute (and in 
      Belgian law) is more restrictive than that of Nuremberg , which to this 
      day remains a primary source of customary law (as applied in the Eichmann 
      and Pinochet affairs). </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The facts of this case are clearly crimes 
      against humanity in the sense of both definitions (Nuremberg and the ICC). 
      The following analysis, made in light of the most strict definition (that 
      of the ICC), demonstrates this sufficiently. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="verdana"><b>B2. First and most 
      important constituent element: an attack against a civilian population.</b></font>
      </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">It is undeniable that the population of Sabra 
      and Shatila was a civilian one. If in the past a limited number of armed 
      resistance fighters had been in the camps, these groups had in any case 
      been evacuated several days previously, in conformity with the 'Habib' 
      accords. If Israeli reports mention isolated acts of resistance, there is 
      every indication that this was a legitimate resistance on the part of 
      civilians, and this does not alter the civilian nature of the population 
      concerned. According to the jurisprudence of the ICTY, even the presence 
      of a minority of armed people in a group essentially made up of civilians 
      does not in any way modify the civilian character of the group. This 
      jurisprudence conforms to the commentaries of the ICRC in the 8 June 1977 
      Additional Protocol (Protocol 1) to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 
      August 1949 relating to the protection of victims of international armed 
      conflicts. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The concept of protecting the life and 
      integrity of civilians is based on empirical and dramatic historical 
      experience, as is expressed very well in the preamble of the ICC Statute: 
      &quot;Mindful that during this century millions of children, women and men have 
      been victims of unimaginable atrocities that deeply shock the conscience 
      of humanityโฆ&quot; Every attack that targets civilians as such is eminently 
      grave. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The exclusively civilian presence is 
      confirmed by the ensemble of testimonies and reports. The most revealing 
      is that reported by an (unnamed) information services officer in the 
      evening of the first day, Thursday 16 December, at 20.40 - &quot;There are 
      evidently no terrorists in the camp. &quot; </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Not only, therefore, were the camps 
      exclusively populated by civilians, but the Israeli commander had been 
      aware of this from the previous day. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Is indicated above, Article 7.2 of the ICC 
      Statute specifies the notion of attack against a civilian population by 
      adding two additional sub-criteria: </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="verdana"><b>B2.1. First 
      sub-criterion: multiple crimes</b></font> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The first sub-criterion refers to the number 
      of crimes (multiple commissions). The classic doctrine demanding that the 
      crime be committed on a massive scale is not necessarily concerned with 
      the purely statistical sense of the term. There are no abstract criteria, 
      or specific figures for qualifying these criteria. In addition, as 
      mentioned above, the large-scale character is not retained as an element 
      in the ICC Statute's definition and neither, therefore, in the Belgian law 
      of 10 February 1999. On the contrary, a proposal to include as a condition 
      that the crime be &quot;perpetrated on a large scale&quot; was rejected. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">In any case, multiple murders, rapes and 
      other crimes specified by the above definition were committed at Sabra and 
      Shatila between 16-18 September 1982, as evidenced by the testimonies of 
      the long list of plaintiffs and witnesses, who constitute only some of the 
      survivors of the massacres. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The references to rape are particularly 
      systematic. The rape and murder of a young woman of 19 who worked at the 
      hospital are well known (cf. the testimony of Ben Alofs), but the 
      phenomenon's recurrence can be found in several passages, mentioned for 
      example in Kapeliouk. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="verdana"><b>B2.2. Second 
      sub-criterion: organisation and/or agreement</b></font> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The second sub-criterion in the definition of 
      the Statute is that the acts must be committed in the application or the 
      pursuit of a political collective (of a state or an organisation). The 
      notion 'political' demands a certain degree of co-ordination in the heart 
      of the organisation, state or otherwise, to which the perpetrators belong.
      </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The importance of this second sub-criterion 
      must however be relativised: the most recent evolution of the ICTY 
      jurisprudence shows that the criteria of co-operation is no longer really 
      considered a constituent element of a crime against humanity, but more as 
      an indication of the systematic nature of the crime. The reverse is 
      already accepted by doctrine and jurisprudence: the general or systematic 
      character is in itself an important indication of prior planning. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">In any case, even if we are to leave aside 
      the most recent evolutions in the subject, the present facts sufficiently 
      demonstrate that the massacres were planned and organised. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">First of all, the highly efficient 
      cooperation between the Phalangist forces and the regular Israeli army (IDF) 
      sufficiently indicates the existence of prior planning or at least 
      organisation, without which the massacre at Sabra and Shatila would not 
      have been able to take place. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The closure of the camps was made airtight by 
      the Israeli forces, and several reports underline how those who attempted 
      to escape in the first two days were turned back by the Israeli soldiers, 
      who had received the order to &quot;seal off&quot; the camp. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Several testimonies made by foreigners 
      confirm these facts. Including the testimony of Astrid Barkved before the 
      Nordic Commission: </p>
      <blockquote dir="ltr">
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i><b>Nordic Commission:</b> Did I 
        understand you correctly that all Thursday, that is the day between 
        those two days which we have been speaking about, soldiers forced people 
        back into the two camps? People were trying to flee from the camps? </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Astrid Barkved:</b> People tried to flee 
        from the camp and some carried white flags. They went to the Israelis to 
        tell them to stop shooting but they were sent back again to the 
        hospital. </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Nordic Commission:</b> By Israeli 
        soldiers or by other soldiers? </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Astrid Barkved:</b> By the Israelis. </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Nordic Commission:</b> So they were 
        forced back into the camp on Thursday? </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Astrid Barkved:</b> Yes.</i></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">In addition, over and above the elements of 
      the event already evoked in this first part of this complaint, this 
      pre-planning is clearly a result of the following elements: </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
      <ul dir="ltr">
        <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">Minster SHARON and Lebanese president-elect Bashir Gemayel 
        had several meetings about, among other things, the expulsion of 
        Palestinians from Lebanon. According to various sources , one of these 
        meetings took place in the night of 12-13 September and was about the 
        'mopping up' of the camps; </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</li>
        <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">On 9 July 1982, SHARON proposed to HABIB to send the 
        Phalangists into West Beirut , thus evidencing the fact that he had 
        great influence and control over them; none would doubt that the militia 
        acted &quot;under the supervision&quot; of the Israeli army (cf. infra); </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</li>
        <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">Several passages in SHARON's own autobiography (entitled 
        Warrior) deal with his intention to &quot;clean up&quot; Lebanon of everyone 
        involved in or linked to the PLO. It is also in this sense that Israeli 
        journalists explain the ensemble of the operation as a grand design of 
        Mr Sharon, which included the &quot;transfer&quot; of Palestinians from South 
        Lebanon if not from the entire country ; </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</li>
        <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">In his testimony before the official Israeli Inquiry 
        Commission, General YARON declared that he completely approved the 
        decision to send the Phalangist forces into the camps of Sabra &amp; Shatila, 
        particularly for the reason that: &quot;The fighting serves their purposes 
        well, so let them participate and not let the IDF do everything.&quot; </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</li>
        <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">In the MACBRIDE Commission report, it is clearly indicated 
        that the Israeli authorities bear responsibility for the massacres at 
        Sabra and Shatila, because they were implicated in their planning and 
        preparation, and because these authorities facilitated the perpetration 
        of the crimes ; </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</li>
        <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">In the same MACBRIDE report, the international commission 
        also placed the massacres of Sabra and Shatila in the larger context of 
        a policy of destruction - including by shelling - of a series of 
        buildings of clearly civilian character (hospitals, schools etc). </p>
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</li>
        <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">Finally, various sources , as well as the testimonies of 
        the plaintiffs, demonstrate that the armed Israeli forces did not only 
        instigate and facilitate the actions of the Phalangists, but also that 
        IDF soldiers participated in them on site. This is confirmed by the very 
        important testimony of a Dutch doctor (a nurse at the time) who was 
        present at Sabra and Shatila at the time of the massacre and who, among 
        others, confirms having himself seen the coordination between the armed 
        Israeli forces and the Phalangists in the camps. </li>
      </ul>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">It is necessary to wait for the convergence 
      of testimonies on this subject, which for the first time are to be heard 
      before a tribunal. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">From the statements of the plaintiffs and 
      witnesses there arise two new elements: the first is the presence of 
      Israeli soldiers at the scene of the crime, inside the zone of the camps. 
      The second is the collaboration of the Israelis if not in the killing then 
      certainly in the segregation, interrogation and leading of dozens of 
      civilians to destinations from which they would never return. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">It is difficult to imagine that not a single 
      Israeli soldier, whether from the army or from the secret services, 
      penetrated the camps during three days. It must be remembered that the 
      militia were directly solicited for the &quot;mopping up&quot; work, that the 
      various logistical aspect, including a bulldozer used to raze houses and 
      dig mass graves, as well as the lighting of the sky that did not let up 
      all night, that &quot;fresh&quot; militia were sent into the camps in the afternoon 
      of the second day to continue the work: all of these orders were direct 
      orders from the Israeli command. The most striking passage is that where 
      Mr Ariel Sharon gave the order to enter the camps &quot;under the supervision&quot; 
      of his army: </p>
      <blockquote dir="ltr">
        <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>[Wednesday 15 September]: At 9:00 A.M. 
        Sharon arrived at the forward command post together with Saguy. After 
        being told of the Phalange's willingness to enter the camps, he repeated 
        his order to send them in &quot;under the IDF's supervision. &quot;</i></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">It is therefore not surprising that these 
      testimonies agree in places on the presence of Israelis. In the reports 
      and the inquiries, the names of soldiers who saw the killing and protested 
      to their superiors are numerous. Only a few soldiers (no doubt the most 
      honest) made the first move and confided in journalists and inquirers, but 
      naturally those who were with the militia did not do so, and the inquiry 
      should determine exactly how the claim that there was a total absence of 
      Israeli military elements is still maintained. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Even if an inquiry on the presence of 
      Israelis in the camps during the massacre did not come to fruition, there 
      is no doubt (particularly on Friday 17 and Saturday 18 September) that 
      dozens of civilians, mainly men, disappeared after the &quot;screening&quot; was 
      carried out in the presence of the Israeli army. There are numerous 
      testimonies of these murderous selections, especially at the Sports Centre 
      adjoining the camps, where the Israeli army was present in force. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Following are some of the passages in the 
      testimonies that support these two new elements, and that the inquiry 
      should determine in more depth: </p>

      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The indications of planning are therefore 
      numerous and convincing. In every hypothesis, the proof of this 
      constituent element, as with all proof of intention required for the crime 
      of genocide, can be objectively gleaned from the circumstances of the 
      event. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="verdana"><b>B3. Second 
      constituent element: The generalised or systematic character of the 
      attack:</b></font> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">On this point of jurisdiction customary law 
      has equally evolved since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials: currently it is 
      no longer required for the attack against a civilian population to be 
      generalised and systematic. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">In a way, however, the murders and other 
      criminal actions committed at Sabra and Shatila were generalised and 
      systematic. This resulted mainly from the fact that access to the camps 
      was closed, that groups of killers &quot;mopped up&quot; area after area over the 
      course of three days. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="verdana"><b>B4. Third constituent 
      element: The moral element</b></font> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Finally, the crimes must be committed in the 
      knowledge of a generalised or systematic attack against a civilian 
      population. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">As demonstrated in the ICC Statute, it is no 
      longer required for the perpetrator of the crime against humanity to have 
      acted within a policy of persecution, repression or extermination. It is 
      sufficient for the perpetrator to have acted with knowledge of cause (sciens 
      et volens, cf. article 30 of the ICC Statute). This regulation is founded 
      in customary law as well as in the relevant conventional law. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Nonetheless, not only did the persons 
      identified in the present complaint as responsible for the Sabra and 
      Shatila massacres commit or participate in this massacre, but they also 
      acted in the context of a policy of persecution, repression and even 
      extermination. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Finally, it is important here to repeat UN 
      General Assembly resolution 37/123D, by which the Sabra and Shatila 
      massacres was qualified as an act of genocide. Given that, by definition, 
      every act of genocide in the sense of the 1948 Convention constitutes a 
      species of the same genus, that is, a crime against humanity, the 
      acceptance of the qualification of 'genocide' automatically implies that 
      all the criteria for the qualification of a crime against humanity are 
      fulfilled. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">This moral element will be more developed 
      during the discussion of the individual penal responsibility for the Sabra 
      and Shatila massacres (cf. infra, point IV). <br>
&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="verdana" size="4">C. WAR CRIMES</font>
      </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Committed in violation of the provisions of 
      the 1949 IV Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilians in 
      times of war (ratified by Israel and by Belgium ), the Sabra and Shatila 
      massacres must equally be qualified as war crimes in the terms of article 
      8 of the ICC Statute, and as grave violations against persons and property 
      protected by the terms of the Geneva Conventions and of Article 1 ยง 3 of 
      the 16 June 1993 law, these massacres having been perpetrated within the 
      framework of an aggressive invasion by the Israeli army into Lebanese 
      territory, thus presenting an international character to the sense of the 
      IV Convention. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The victims of Sabra and Shatila must all be 
      considered as protected persons as defined in the IV Convention, 
      particularly Article 147. Mr Sharon's allegations of the existence of 
      2,000 armed persons inside the camps were patently contradicted by the 
      facts. Almost none of the Sabra and Shatila refugees put up the slightest 
      resistance. Numerous people were found murdered with their identity cards 
      in their hands, dramatically illustrating their faith in the protection 
      that should have been accorded to them in their capacity as civilians (see 
      supra, B2). </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">To the above is added the fact that the 
      Israeli army was, at the time, an occupation force in the sense of article 
      4 of the same IV Convention, and that this army had therefore a clear 
      responsibility towards the protected persons. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">War crimes consist of, notably: intentional 
      homicide, torture or other inhumane treatment; the destruction of property 
      without military necessity, as well as generally subjecting a civilian 
      population or civilian people to attack, and subjecting undefended 
      localities to attack. All these crimes were committed at Sabra and Shatila 
      by the Phalangist militia, actively supported by the Israeli Defense 
      Forces, who had accorded them control of the camps &quot;under their 
      supervision. &quot; <br>
&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="verdana" size="4">D. COMBINATION 
      OF VIOLATIONS</font> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">In light of the preceding qualifications, we 
      must conclude that the actions of the different perpetrators of the 
      massacres at Sabra and Shatila constitute a combination of material and 
      intential violations. The same facts constitute war crimes, crimes against 
      humanity and the crime of genocide. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">There is no ruling in either customary or 
      conventional law to oppose the application of several qualifications to 
      the same fact or combination of facts. On the contrary: in the first case 
      judged by the ICTR in Arusha (the Akayesu case), a combination of 
      violations was established. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">A combination of violations was also 
      established by the French Cassation Court in the Barbie case. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="verdana" size="4">E. CONCLUSION</font>
      </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The actions committed at Sabra and Shatila 
      together constitute a crime of genocide, a crime against humanity, war 
      crimes and grave violations of the 1949 IV Geneva Conventions. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The present complaint is based on the 
      aforementioned qualifications, which are incriminated in international 
      customary law (ius cogens) as well as in positive Belgian law. <br>

      <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="verdana" size="4">A. GENOCIDE</font>
      </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Universal competence to pursue and punish the 
      crime of genocide stems primarily from ius cogens, and notably from the 
      1948 Convention. In its 8 April 1993 decision, the International Court of 
      Justice declared, &quot;all parties have assumed the obligation to prevent and 
      to punish the crime of genocide &quot; and, &quot;the rights and obligations 
      established by the 1948 Convention are rights and obligations erga omnes.&quot; 
      The ICTY Appeals Chamber, in the Blaskic case, declared that the 
      obligation for each national jurisdiction &quot;to judge or to extradite the 
      persons presumed responsible for grave violations of international 
      humanitarian law &quot; was customary in character. If it is true that Article 
      VI of the Convention effectively expresses preference for the jurisdiction 
      of the tribunals of the State directly concerned with the events, this 
      competence is however not exclusive. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">From the preceding considerations there 
      follows the observation that the law of 10 February 1999 (modifying the 
      law of 16 June 1993) is a procedural law relative to universal competence 
      for crimes of genocide. This law is therefore immediately applicable, 
      whatever the date of the violation. The Belgian legislator has also very 
      clearly applied the same principle in the same domain with the 22 March 
      1996 law relative to the recognition of the International Tribunal for 
      ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda: this recognition rests, in effect, on a formal 
      competence in positive Belgian law in relation to deeds committed since 
      1991; well before the law of 22 March 1996. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="verdana" size="4">B. CRIMES 
      AGAINST HUMANITY</font> </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The civil parties fully adhering to the 
      reasoning developed in the order rendered on 6 November 1998 in the 
      Pinochet case and based in particular on the observation that the crime 
      against humanity can be incriminated in the ius cogens. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">This same reasoning can be found in a number 
      of decisions pronounced in other countries, as, for example, in the 
      Demjanjuk decision, in which a United States federal court decided: &quot;The 
      universality principle is based on the assumption that some crimes are so 
      universally condemned that the perpetrators are the enemies of all people. 
      Therefore, any nation which has custody of the perpetrators may punish 
      them according to its law applicable to such offences... Israel or any 
      other nation... may undertake to vindicate the interest of all nations by 
      seeking to punish the perpetrators of such crimes. &quot; </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">In addition, the civil parties emphasise that 
      the Belgian government and legislator expressly approved this reasoning in 
      the preparation of the law of 19 February 1999, modifying the law of 16 
      June 1993. In confirming the ius cogens as a source for incrimination, the 
      government and legislator also evidenced the procedural law character of 
      the law of 10 February 1999. As such, and particularly with regard to 
      universal competence, it is thus (as is the crime of genocide) for 
      immediate application, whatever the date of the violation. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="verdana" size="4">C. WAR CRIMES</font>
      </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">According to article 146 of the 1949 Geneva 
      Convention, &quot;Each High Contracting Party shall be under the obligation to 
      search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be 
      committed, such grave breaches, and shall bring such persons, regardless 
      of their nationality, before its own courts. It may also, if it prefers, 
      and in accordance with the provisions of its own legislation, hand such 
      persons over for trial to another High Contracting Party concerned, 
      provided such High Contracting Party has made out a prima facie case.&quot; </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">In this way, for example, the Military Code 
      of the United States of America contains an express disposition with 
      regard to the universal competence for crimes against humanity. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The law of 16 June 1993 forms, in internal 
      Belgian law, the execution of this international obligation in terms of 
      universal jurisdiction. Also in these terms, the law of 16 June 1993 must 
      be immediately applied, whatever the date of the violation (cf. supra).

      </table>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Not until the event of an in-depth 
      investigation will it be possible to determine the exact responsibilities 
      of the protagonists of these crimes. The KAHAN report concluded the 
      personal responsibility of Defence Minister Ariel SHARON in the Sabra and 
      Shatila massacres. It also indicated the responsibility of Lieutenant 
      General Rafael Eitan, Commandant Brigadier General Amos YARON and 
      Commandant Major General DROURI, as well as that of the Phalangist 
      leaders. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The central figure is undeniably General 
      Ariel SHARON, then Israeli Defence Minister, who personally directed the 
      military operations in the Lebanon and who was in Beirut at the time of 
      the events. Mr Sharon is currently Prime Minister of Israel. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Certain information indicates that Mr SHARON, 
      although preferring to allow his local collaborators to perform the 
      massacre in the camps, might have planned it with a view to terrorising 
      the entirety of the Palestinian population of the Lebanon and thus pushing 
      it to leave or at least to retreat to the north of the country. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The constituent elements of these indications 
      are Sharon's public announcement that &quot;2,000 terrorists remain in the 
      camps&quot; and the declaration before an assembly of Phalangists after the 
      assassination of their leader Gemayel that they &quot;shouldn't cry like 
      women,&quot; but rather that they must &quot;act like men,&quot; making explicit 
      reference to the Palestinian camps. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">It is noteworthy that in the weeks leading up 
      to the massacre, other war crimes were committed against the civilian 
      Palestinian population of South Lebanon, notably in Tyre and Sydon. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Concerning the Phalangist militia, they could 
      be considered de facto auxiliary forces to the military power occupying 
      South Lebanon and Beirut at the time. These militia were armed and trained 
      by Israel. Their leaders would not have been able to take any initiative 
      that would go against the will of the occupying power, and the operations 
      they carried out were devised and prepared in collaboration with the 
      Israeli military leaders. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Finally, it was the Israeli army that created 
      the necessary environment for the crime to take place, notably by 
      surrounding the camps with troops, providing logistical support to the 
      militia and lighting up the camps throughout the night. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">As for the named protagonists, one can refer 
      to the names cited in the Kahan reports and in the works of Kapeliouk and 
      Schiff &amp; Yaari. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">It is worth considering Article 4 of the law 
      of 16 June 1993 concerning the inclusion of participatory acts to the 
      crime in the sense of Articles 66 and 67 of the Penal Code, and failing 
      actively to intervene to prevent or put an end to the offence in the event 
      that it is possible to do so. This last incrimination - that of the 
      responsibility of the superior - has its origin in the jurisprudence of 
      the Nuremberg tribunals and was clearly marked in Articles 86 and 87 of 
      the 1977 Geneva Protocol 1. These regulations relating to the 
      responsibility of the superior are also present in customary law ,. Also 
      on this point, therefore, the law of 16 June 1993 has not created a new 
      incrimination. Article 4 of this law states and confirms a pre-existing 
      regulation in international customary law. As such, and in light of 
      Articles 7.2 of the ECHR and 15.2 of the 1966 International Pact on Civil 
      and Political Rights, it can be applied to the facts of the present case.
      </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Regarding the responsibility of superior, it 
      is necessary to add that it does not only apply to offences committed by 
      persons in a formally subordinate relationship, but also to all other 
      persons - whether soldiers or not - who, at the time of the offence find 
      themselves under the control of the commandant. The tie of subordination 
      is estimated both de jure and de facto. </p>
      <p align="justify" dir="ltr">The plaintiffs bring a civil indictment 
      against Arial SHARON, Israeli Defence Minister at the time of the events 
      and currently Prime Minister; against Amos Yaron, commandant of the 
      division and Brigadier General at the time of the events and currently 
      Secretary General of the Defence Ministry, and against all other person, 
      whether Lebanese or Israel, whose responsibility will be established 
      during the events of the investigation. <br>
