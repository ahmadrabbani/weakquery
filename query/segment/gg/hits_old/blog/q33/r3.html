			<br>
			Israel's Prime Minister was a ruthless military commander 
			responsible for one of the most shocking war crimes of the 20th 
			century, argues Robert Fisk. President George Bush acclaims Ariel 
			Sharon as 'a man of peace', yet the blood that was shed at Sabra and 
			Chatila remains a stain on the conscience of the Zionist nation. As 
			Sharon lies stricken in his hospital bed, his political career over, 
			how will history judge him?<br>
			<br>
			<b>By Robert Fisk<br>
			<br>
			01/06/05 &quot;</b><strong>&quot;</strong><a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/fisk/article336785.ece"><strong>The 
			Independent</strong></a><strong>&quot;</strong><b>&quot;</b> -- -- I shook hands with him once, a 
			brisk, no-nonsense soldier's grip from Sharon as he finished a 
			review of the vicious Phalangist militiamen who stood in the 
			barracks square at Karantina in Beirut. Who would have thought, I 
			asked myself then, that this same bunch of murderers - the men who 
			butchered their way through the Palestinian Sabra and Chatila 
			refugee camps only a few weeks earlier - had their origins in the 
			Nazi Olympics of 1936. That's when old Pierre Gemayel - still alive 
			and standing stiffly to attention for Sharon - watched the &quot;order&quot; 
			of Nazi Germany and proposed to bring some of this &quot;order&quot; to 
			Lebanon. That's what Gemayel told me himself. Did Sharon not 
			understand this. Of course, he must have done. <br>
			<br>
			Back on 18 September that same year, Loren Jenkins of The Washington 
			Post and Karsten Tveit of Norwegian television and I had clambered 
			over the piled corpses of Chatila - of raped and eviscerated women 
			and their husbands and children and brothers - and Jenkins, knowing 
			that the Isrealis had sat around the camps for two nights watching 
			this filth, shrieked &quot;Sharon!&quot; in anger and rage. He was right. 
			Sharon it was who sent the Phalange into the camps on the night of 
			16 September - to hunt for &quot;terrorists&quot;, so he claimed at the time.<br>
			<br>
			The subsequent Israeli Kahan commission of enquiry into this 
			atrocity provided absolute proof that Israeli soldiers saw the 
			massacre taking place. The evidence of a Lieutenant Avi Grabovsky 
			was crucial. He was an Israeli deputy tank commander and reported 
			what he saw to his higher command. &quot;Don't interfere,&quot; the senior 
			officer said. Ever afterwards, Israeli embassies around the world 
			would claim that the commission held Sharon only indirectly 
			responsible for the massacre. It was untrue. The last page of the 
			official Israeli report held Sharon &quot;personally responsible&quot;. It was 
			years later that the Israeli-trained Phalangist commander, Elie 
			Hobeika, now working for the Syrians, agreed to turn state's 
			evidence against Sharon - now the Israeli Prime Minister - at a 
			Brussels court. The day after the Israeli attorney general declared 
			Sharon's defence a &quot;state&quot; matter, Hobeika was killed by a massive 
			car bomb in east Beirut. Israel denied responsibility. US Defence 
			Secretary Donald Rumsfeld traveled to Brussels and quietly 
			threatened to withdraw Nato headquarters from Belgium if the country 
			maintained its laws to punish war criminals from foreign nations. 
			Within months, George W Bush had declared Sharon &quot;a man of peace&quot;. 
			It was all over.<br>
			<br>
			In the end, Sharon got away with it, even when it was proved that he 
			had, the night before the Phalangists attacked the civilians of the 
			camp, publicly blamed the Palestinians for the murder of their 
			leader, President-elect Bashir Gemayel. Sharon told these ruthless 
			men that the Palestinians had killed their beloved &quot;chief&quot;. Then he 
			sent them in among the civilian sheep - and claimed later he could 
			never have imagined what they would do in Chatila. Only years later 
			was it proved that hundreds of Palestinians who survived the 
			original massacre were interrogated by the Israelis and then handed 
			back to the murderers to be slaughtered over the coming weeks.<br>
			<br>
			So it is as a war criminal that Sharon will be known forever in the 
			Arab world, through much of the Western world, in fact - save, of 
			course, for the craven men in the White House and the State 
			Department and the Blair Cabinet - as well as many leftist Israelis. 
			Sabra and Chatila was a crime against humanity. Its dead counted 
			more than half the fatalities of the World Trade Centre attacks of 
			2001. But the man who was responsible was a &quot;man of peace&quot;. It was 
			he who claimed that the preposterous Yasser Arafat was a Palestinian 
			bin Laden. He it was who as Israeli foreign minister opposed Nato's 
			war in Kosovo, inveighing against &quot;Islamic terror&quot; in Kosovo. &quot;The 
			moment that Israel expresses support...it's likely to be the next 
			victim. Imagine that one day Arabs in Galilee demand that the region 
			in which they live be recognised as an autonomous area, connected to 
			the Palestinian Authority...&quot; Ah yes, Sharon as an ally of another 
			war criminal, Slobodan Milosevic. There must be no Albanian state in 
			Kosovo.<br>
			<br>
			Ever since he was elected in 2001 - and especially since his 
			withdrawal of settlements from the rubbish tip of Gaza last year, a 
			step which would, according to his spokesman, turn any plans for a 
			Palestinian state in the West Bank into &quot;formaldehyde&quot; - his 
			supporters have tried to turn Sharon into a pragmatist, another 
			Charles de Gaulle. His new party was supposed to be proof of this. 
			But in reality, Sharon had more in common with the putchist generals 
			of Algeria.<br>
			<br>
			He voted against the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979. He voted 
			against a withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 1985. He opposed 
			Israel's participation in the Madrid peace conference in 1991. He 
			opposed the Knesset plenum vote on the Oslo agreement in 1993. He 
			abstained on a vote for peace with Jordan in 1994. He voted against 
			the Hebron agreement in 1997. He condemned the manner of Israel's 
			retreat from Lebanon in 2000. By 2002, he had built 34 new Jewish 
			colonies on Palestinian land.<br>
			<br>
			And he was a man of peace.<br>
			<br>
			There was a story told to me by one of the men investigating 
			Sharon's responsibility for the Sabra and Chatila massacre, and the 
			story is that the then Israeli defence minister, before he sent his 
			Phalangist allies into the camps, announced that it was Palestinian 
			&quot;terrorists&quot; who had murdered their newly assassinated leader, 
			President-elect Gemayel. Sharon was to say later that he never 
			dreamed the Phalange would massacre the Palestinians.<br>
			<br>
			But how could he say that if he claimed earlier that the 
			Palestinians killed the leader of the Phalange? In reality, no 
			Palestinians were involved in Gemayel's death. It might seem odd in 
			this new war to be dwelling about that earlier atrocity. I am 
			fascinated by the language. Murderers, terrorists. That's what 
			Sharon said then, and it's what he says now. Did he really make that 
			statement in 1982? I begin to work the phone from Jerusalem, calling 
			up Associated Press bureaus that might still have their files from 
			19 years ago. He would have made that speech - if indeed he used 
			those words - some time on 15 September 1982.<br>
			<br>
			One Sunday afternoon, my phone rings in Jerusalem. It's from an 
			Israeli I met in Jaffa Street after the Sbarro bombing. An American 
			Jewish woman had been screaming abuse at me - foreign journalists 
			are being insulted by both sides with ever more violent language - 
			and this man suddenly intervenes to protect me. He's smiling and 
			cheerful and we exchange phone numbers. Now on the phone, he says 
			he's taking the El-Al night flight to New York with his wife. Would 
			I like to drop by for tea?<br>
			<br>
			He turns out to have a luxurious apartment next to the King David 
			Hotel and I notice, when I read his name on the outside security 
			buzzer, that he's a rabbi. He's angry because a neighbour has just 
			let down a friend's car tyres in the underground parking lot and 
			he's saying how he felt like smashing the windows of the neighbour's 
			car. His wife, bringing me tea and feeding me cookies, says that her 
			husband - again, he should remain anonymous - gets angry very 
			quickly. There's a kind of gentleness about them both - how easy it 
			is to spot couples who are still in love - that is appealing. But 
			when the rabbi starts to talk about the Palestinians, his voice 
			begins to echo through the apartment. He says several times that 
			Sharon is a good friend of his, a fine man, who's been to visit him 
			in his New York office.<br>
			<br>
			What we should do is go into those vermin pits and take out the 
			terrorists and murderers. Vermin pits, yes I said, vermin, animals. 
			I tell you what we should do. If one stone is lobbed from a refugee 
			camp, we should bring the bulldozers and tear down the first 20 
			houses close to the road. If there's another stone, another 20 ones. 
			They'd soon learn not to throw stones. Look, I tell you this. Stones 
			are lethal. If you throw a stone at me, I'll shoot you. I have the 
			right to shoot you.<br>
			<br>
			Now the rabbi is a generous man. He's been in Israel to donate a 
			vastly important and, I have no doubt, vastly expensive medical 
			centre to the country. He is well-read. And I liked the fact that - 
			unlike too many Israelis and Palestinians who put on a 
			&quot;we-only-want-peace&quot; routine to hide more savage thoughts - he at 
			least spoke his mind. But this is getting out of hand.<br>
			<br>
			Why should I throw a stone at the rabbi? He shouts again. &quot;If you 
			throw a stone at me, I will shoot you.&quot; But if you throw a stone at 
			me, I say, I won't shoot you. Because I have the right not to shoot 
			you. He frowns. &quot;Then I'd say you're out of your mind.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			I am driving home when it suddenly hits me. The Old and New 
			Testaments have just collided. The rabbi's dad taught him about an 
			eye for an eye - or 20 homes for a stone - whereas Bill Fisk taught 
			me about turning the other cheek. Judaism is bumping against 
			Christianity. So is it any surprise that Judaism and Islam are 
			crashing into each other? For despite all the talk of Christians and 
			Jews being &quot;people of the Book&quot;, Muslims are beginning to express 
			ever harsher views of Jews. The sickening Hamas references to Jews 
			as &quot;the sons of pigs and monkeys&quot; are echoed by Israelis who talk of 
			Palestinians as cockroaches or &quot;vermin&quot;, who tell you - as the rabbi 
			told me - that Islam is a warrior religion, a religion that does not 
			value human life. And I recall several times a Jewish settler who 
			told me back in 1993 - in Gaza, just before the Oslo accords were 
			signed - that &quot;we do not recognise their Koran as a valid document.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			I call up Eva Stern in New York. Her talent for going through 
			archives convinces me she can find out what Sharon said before the 
			Sabra and Chatila massacre. I give her the date that is going 
			through my head: 15 September 1982. She comes back on the line the 
			same night. &quot;Turn your fax on,&quot; Eva says. &quot;You're going to want to 
			read this.&quot; The paper starts to crinkle out of the machine. An AP 
			report of 15 September 1982. &quot;Defence Minister Ariel Sharon, in a 
			statement, tied the killing [of the Phalangist leader Gemayel] to 
			the PLO, saying: &quot;It symbolises the terrorist murderousness of the 
			PLO terrorist organisations and their supporters.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			Then, a few hours later, Sharon sent the Phalange gunmen into the 
			Palestinian camps. Reading that fax again and again, I feel a chill 
			coming over me. There are Israelis today with as much rage towards 
			the Palestinians as the Phalange 19 years ago. And these are the 
			same words I am hearing today, from the same man, about the same 
			people.<br>
			<br>
			In September 2000, Ariel Sharon marched to the Muslim holy places - 
			above the site of the Jewish Temple Mount - accompanied by about a 
			thousand Israeli policemen. Within 24 hours, Israeli snipers opened 
			fire with rifles on Palestinian protesters battling with police in 
			the grounds of the seventh-century Dome of the Rock. At least four 
			were killed and the head of the Israeli police, Yehuda Wilk, later 
			confirmed that snipers had fired into the crowd when Palestinians 
			&quot;were felt to be endangering the lives of officers&quot;. Sixty-six 
			Palestinians were wounded, most of them by rubber-coated steel 
			bullets. The killings came almost exactly 10 years after armed 
			Israeli police killed 19 Palestinian demonstrators and wounded 
			another 140 in an incident at exactly the same spot, a slaughter 
			that almost lost the United States its Arab support in the prelude 
			to the 1991 Gulf War.<br>
			<br>
			Sharon showed no remorse. &quot;The state of Israel,&quot; he told CNN, 
			&quot;cannot afford that an Israeli citizen will not be able to visit 
			part of his country, not to speak for the holiest for the Jewish 
			people all around the world.&quot; He did not, however, explain why he 
			should have chosen this moment - immediately after the collapse of 
			the &quot;peace process&quot; - to undertake such a provocative act. 
			Stone-throwing and shooting spread to the West Bank. Near Qalqiliya, 
			a Palestinian policeman shot dead an Israeli soldier and wounded 
			another - they were apparently part of a joint Israeli-Palestinian 
			patrol originally set up under the terms of the Oslo agreement. 
			&quot;Everything was pre-planned,&quot; Sharon would claim five weeks later. 
			&quot;They took advantage of my visit to the Temple Mount. This was not 
			the first time I've been there...&quot;<br>
			<br>
			Jerusalem is a city of illusions. Here Ariel Sharon promises his 
			people &quot;security&quot; and brings them war. On the main road to Ma'ale 
			Adumim, inside Israel's illegal &quot;municipal boundaries&quot;, Israelis 
			drive at over 100 mph. In the old city, Israeli troops and 
			Palestinian civilians curse each other before the few astonished 
			Christian tourists. Loving Jesus doesn't help to make sense of the 
			Arab-Israeli conflict. Gideon Samet got it right in Ha'aretz. 
			&quot;Jerusalem looks like a Bosnia about to be born. Main thoroughfares 
			inside the Green Line... have become mortally perilous... The 
			capital's suburbs are exposed as Ramat Rachel was during the war of 
			independence...&quot; Samet is pushing it a bit. Life is more dangerous 
			for Palestinians than for Israelis. Terrorism, terrorism, terrorism. 
			&quot;I suggest that we repeat to ourselves every day and throughout the 
			day,&quot; Sharon tells us, &quot;that there will be no negotiations with the 
			Palestinians until there is a total cessation of terrorism, violence 
			and incitement.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			Gaza now is a miniature Beirut. Under Israeli siege, struck by F-16s 
			and tank fire and gunboats, starved and often powerless - there are 
			now six-hour electricity cuts every day in Gaza - it's as if Arafat 
			and Sharon are replaying their bloody days in Lebanon. Sharon used 
			to call Arafat a mass murderer back then. It's important not to 
			become obsessed during wars. But Sharon's words were like an old, 
			miserable film had seen before. Every morning in Jerusalem, I would 
			pick up the Jerusalem Post. And there on the front page, as usual, 
			will be another Sharon diatribe. PLO murderers. Palestinian 
			Authority terror. Murderous terrorists.<br>
			<br>
			Within hours of the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States, 
			Ariel Sharon turned Israel into America's ally in the &quot;war on 
			terror&quot;, immediately realigning Yasser Arafat as the Palestinian 
			version of bin Laden and the Palestinian suicide bombers as blood 
			brothers of the 19 Arabs - none of them Palestinian - who hijacked 
			the four American airliners. In the new and vengeful spirit that 
			President Bush encouraged among Americans, Israel's supporters in 
			the United States now felt free to promote punishments for Israel's 
			opponents that came close to the advocacy of war crimes. Nathan 
			Lewin, a prominent Washington attorney and Jewish communal leader - 
			and an often-mentioned candidate for a federal judgeship - called 
			for the execution of family members of suicide bombers. &quot;If 
			executing some suicide bombers' families saves the lives of even an 
			equal number of potential civilian victims, the exchange is, I 
			believe, ethically permissible,&quot; he wrote in the journal Sh'ma.<br>
			<br>
			When Sharon began his operation &quot;Defensive Shield&quot;, the UN Security 
			Council, with the active participation and support of the United 
			States, demanded an immediate end to Israel's reoccupation of the 
			West Bank. President George W Bush insisted that Sharon should 
			follow the advice of &quot;Israel's American friends&quot; and - for Tony 
			Blair was with Bush at the time - &quot;Israel's British friends&quot;, and 
			withdraw. &quot;When I say withdraw, I mean it,&quot; Bush snapped three days 
			later. But he meant nothing of the kind. Instead, he sent secretary 
			of state Colin Powell off on an &quot;urgent&quot; mission of peace, a journey 
			to Israel and the West Bank that would take an incredible eight days 
			- just enough time, Bush presumably thought, to allow his &quot;friend&quot; 
			Sharon to finish his latest bloody adventure in the West Bank. 
			Supposedly unaware that Israel's chief of staff, Shoal Mofaz, had 
			told Sharon that he needed at least eight weeks to &quot;finish the job&quot; 
			of crushing the Palestinians, Powell wandered off around the 
			Mediterranean, dawdling in Morocco, Spain, Egypt and Jordan before 
			finally fetching up in Israel. If Washington firefighters took that 
			long to reach a blaze, the American capital would long ago have 
			turned to ashes. But of course, the purpose of Powell's idleness was 
			to allow enough time for Jenin to be turned to ashes. Mission, I 
			suppose, accomplished.<br>
			<br>
			Sharon's ability to scorn the Americans was always humiliating for 
			Washington. Before the massacres of 1982, Philip Habib was President 
			Reagan's special representative, his envoy to Beirut increasingly 
			horrified by the ferocity of Sharon's assault on the city. Not long 
			before he died, I asked Habib why he didn't stop the bloodshed. &quot;I 
			could see it,&quot; he said. &quot;I told the Israelis they were destroying 
			the city, that they were firing non-stop. They just said they 
			weren't. They said they werent doing that. I called Sharon on the 
			phone. He said it wasnt true. That damned man said to me on the 
			phone that what I saw happening wasn't happening. So I held the 
			telephone out of the window so he could hear the explosions. Then he 
			said to me: 'What kind of conversation is this where you hold a 
			telephone out of a window?'&quot;<br>
			<br>
			Sharon's involvement in the 1982 Sabra and Chatila massacres 
			continues to fester around the man who, according to Israel's 1993 
			Kahan commission report, bore &quot;personal responsibility&quot; for the 
			Phalangist slaughter. So fearful were the Israeli authorities that 
			their leaders would be charged with war crimes that they drew up a 
			list of countries where they might have to stand trial - and which 
			they should henceforth avoid - now that European nations were 
			expanding their laws to include foreign nationals who had committed 
			crimes abroad. Belgian judges were already considering a complaint 
			by survivors of Sabra and Chatila - one of them a female rape victim 
			- while a campaign had been mounted abroad against other Israeli 
			figures associated with the atrocities. Eva Stern was one of those 
			who tried to prevent Brigadier General Amos Yaron being appointed 
			Israeli defence attaché in Washington because he had allowed the 
			Lebanese Phalange militia to enter the camps on 16 September 1982, 
			and knew - according to the Kahan commission report - that women and 
			children were being murdered. He only ended the killings two days 
			later. Canada declined to accept Yaron as defence attaché. Stern, 
			who compiled a legal file on Yaron, later vainly campaigned with 
			human rights groups to annul his appointment - by Prime Minister 
			Ehud Barak - as director general of the Israeli defence ministry. 
			The Belgian government changed their law - and dropped potential 
			charges against Sharon - after a visit to Brussels by US defence 
			secretary Donald Rumsfeld, the man who famously referred on 6 August 
			2002 to Israelis' control over &quot;the so-called occupied territory&quot; 
			which was &quot;the result of a war, which they won&quot;.<br>
			<br>
			Rumsfeld had threatened that NATO headquarters might be withdrawn 
			from Belgian soil if the Belgians didn't drop the charges against 
			Sharon.<br>
			<br>
			Yet all the while, we were supposed to believe that it was the 
			corrupt, Parkinson's-haunted Yasser Arafat who was to blame for the 
			new war. He was chastised by George Bush while the Palestinian 
			people continued to be bestialised by the Israeli leadership. Rafael 
			Eytan, the former Israeli chief of staff, had referred to 
			Palestinians as &quot;cockroaches in a glass jar&quot;. Menachem Begin called 
			them &quot;two-legged beasts&quot;. The Shas party leader who suggested that 
			God should send the Palestinian &quot;ants&quot; to hell, also called them 
			&quot;serpents&quot;.<br>
			<br>
			In August 2000, Barak called them crocodiles. Israeli chief of staff 
			Moshe Yalon described the Palestinians as a &quot;cancerous 
			manifestation&quot; and equated the military action in the occupied 
			territories with &quot;chemotherapy&quot;. In March 2001, the Israeli tourism 
			minister, Rehavem Zeevi, called Arafat a &quot;scorpion&quot;. Sharon 
			repeatedly called Arafat a &quot;murderer&quot; and compared him to bin Laden.<br>
			<br>
			He contributed to the image of Palestinian inhumanity in an 
			interview in 1995, when he stated that Fatah sometimes punished 
			Palestinians by &quot;chopping off limbs of seven- and eight-year-old 
			children in front of their parents as a form of punishment&quot;. However 
			brutal Fatah may be, there is no record of any such atrocity being 
			committed by them. But if enough people can be persuaded to believe 
			this nonsense, then the use of Israeli death squads against such 
			Palestinians becomes natural rather than illegal.<br>
			<br>
			Sharon was forever, like his Prime Minister Menachem Begin, evoking 
			the Second World War in spurious parallels with the Arab-Israeli 
			conflict. When in the late winter of 1988 the US State Department 
			opened talks with the PLO in Tunis after Arafat renounced 
			&quot;terrorism&quot;, Sharon stated in an interview with the Wall Street 
			Journal that this was worse than the British and French appeasement 
			before the Second World War when &quot;the world, to prevent war, 
			sacrificed one of the democracies&quot;. Arafat was &quot;like Hitler who 
			wanted so much to negotiate with the Allies in the second half of 
			the second world war...and the Allies said 'No'. They said there are 
			enemies with whom you don't talk. They pushed him to the bunker in 
			Berlin where he found his death, and Arafat is the same kind of 
			enemy, that with whom you don't talk. He's got too much blood on his 
			hands.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			Thus within his lifetime Sharon was able to bestialise Yasser Arafat 
			as both Hitler and bin Laden. The thrust of Sharon's argument in 
			those days was that the creation of a Palestinian state would mean a 
			war in which &quot;the terrorists will be acting from behind a cordon of 
			UN forces and observers&quot;. By the time he was on his apparent death 
			bed yesterday that Palestinian &quot;state&quot;, far from being protected by 
			the UN, was non-existent, its territory still being carved up in the 
			West Bank by growing Jewish settlements, road blocks and a concrete 
			wall.<br>
			<br>
			Largely forgotten amid Sharon's hatred for &quot;terrorism&quot; was his 
			outspoken criticism of Nato's war against Serbia in 1999, when he 
			was Israeli foreign minister. Eleven years earlier he had 
			sympathised with the political objective of Slobodan Milosevic: to 
			prevent the establishment of an Albanian state in Kosovo. This, he 
			said, would lead to &quot;Greater Albania&quot; and provide a haven for - 
			readers must here hold their breath - &quot;Islamic terror&quot;. In a 
			Belgrade newspaper interview, Sharon said that &quot;we stand together 
			with you against the Islamic terror&quot;. Once Nato's bombing of Serbia 
			was under way, however, Sharon's real reason for supporting the 
			Serbs became apparent. &quot;It's wrong for Israel to provide legitimacy 
			to this forceful sort of intervention which the Nato countries are 
			deploying... in an attempt to impose a solution on regional 
			disputes,&quot; he said. &quot;The moment Israel expresses support for the 
			sort of model of action we're seeing in Kosovo, it's likely to be 
			the next victim. Imagine that one day Arabs in Galilee demand that 
			the region in which they live be recognised as an autonomous area, 
			connected to the Palestinian Authority...&quot;<br>
			<br>
			NATO's bombing, Sharon said, was &quot;brutal interventionism&quot;. The 
			Israeli journalist Uri Avnery, who seized on this extraordinary 
			piece of duplicity, said that &quot;Islamic terror&quot; in Kosovo could only 
			exist in &quot;Sharon's racist imagination&quot;. Avnery was far bolder in 
			translating what lay behind Sharon's antipathy towards Nato action 
			than Sharon himself. &quot;If the Americans and the Europeans interfere 
			today in the matter of Kosovo, what is to prevent them from doing 
			the same tomorrow in the matter of Palestine?<br>
			<br>
			&quot;Sharon has made it crystal-clear to the world that there is a 
			similarity and perhaps even identity between Milosevic's attitude 
			towards Kosovo and the attitude of Netanyahu and Sharon towards the 
			Palestinians.&quot; Besides, for a man whose own &quot;brutal interventionism&quot; 
			in Lebanon in 1982 led to a Middle East bloodbath of unprecedented 
			proportions, Sharon's remarks were, to say the least, hypocritical.<br>
			<br>
			As Sharon sent an armoured column to reinvade Nablus, still ignoring 
			Bush's demand to withdraw his troops from the West Bank, Colin 
			Powell turned on Arafat, warning him that it was his &quot;last chance&quot; 
			to show his leadership. There was no mention of the illegal Jewish 
			settlements. There was to be no &quot;last chance&quot; threat for Sharon. The 
			Americans even allowed him to refuse a UN fact-finding team in the 
			occupied territories. Sharon was meeting with President George W 
			Bush in Washington when a suicide bomber killed at least 15 Israeli 
			civilians in a Tel Aviv nightclub; he broke off his visit and 
			returned at once to Israel. Prominent American Jewish leaders, 
			including Elie Wiesel and Alan Dershowitz, immediately called upon 
			the White House not to put pressure on Sharon to join new Middle 
			East peace talks. &quot;This is a tough time,&quot; Wiesel announced. &quot;This is 
			not a time to pressure Israel. Any prime minister would do what 
			Sharon is doing. He is doing his best. They should trust him.&quot; 
			Wiesel need hardly have worried.<br>
			<br>
			Only a month earlier, the Americans rolled out their first S-70A-55 
			troopcarrying Black Hawk helicopter to be sold to the Israelis. 
			Israel had purchased 24 of the new machines, costing $211m - most of 
			which would be paid for by the United States - even though it had 24 
			earlier-model Black Hawks. The log book of the first of the new 
			helicopters was ceremonially handed over to the director general of 
			the Israeli defence ministry, the notorious Amos Yaron, by none 
			other than Alexander Haig - the man who gave Begin the green light 
			to invade Lebanon in 1982.<br>
			<br>
			Perhaps the only man who now had the time to work out the logic of 
			this appalling conflict was the Palestinian leader sitting now in 
			his surrounded, broken, ill-lit and unhealthy office block in 
			Ramallah. The one characteristic Arafat shared with Sharon - apart 
			from old age and decrepitude - was his refusal to plan ahead. What 
			he said, what he did, what he proposed, was decided only at the 
			moment he was forced to act. This was partly his old guerrilla 
			training, a characteristic shared by Saddam. If you don't know what 
			you are going to do tomorrow, you can be sure that your enemies 
			don't know either. Sharon took the same view.<br>
			<br>
			The most terrible incident - praised by Sharon at the time as a 
			&quot;great success&quot; - was the attack by Israel on Salah Shehada, a Hamas 
			leader, which slaughtered nine children along with eight adults. 
			Their names gave a frightful reality to this child carnage: 
			18-month-old Ayman Matar, three-year-old Mohamed Matar, 
			five-year-old Diana Matar, four-year-old Sobhi Hweiti, six-year-old 
			Mohamed Hweiti, 10-year-old Ala Matar, 15-year-old Iman Shehada, 
			17-year-old Maryam Matar. And Dina Matar. She was two months old. An 
			Israeli air force pilot dropped a one-ton bomb on their homes from 
			an American-made F-16 aircraft on 22 July 2002.<br>
			<br>
			What war did Sharon think he was fighting? And what was he fighting 
			for? Sharon regarded the attack as a victory against &quot;terror&quot;. 
			Al-Wazzir, now an economic analyst in Gaza, believed that people who 
			did not believe themselves to be targets were now finding themselves 
			under attack. &quot;There's a network of Israeli army and air force 
			intelligence and Mossad and Shin Bet that works together, feeding 
			each other information. They can cross the lines between Area C and 
			Area B in the occupied territories. Usually they carry out 
			operations when IDF morale is low. When they killed my father, the 
			IDF was in very low spirits because of the first intifada. So they 
			go for a 'spectacular' to show what great 'warriors' they are. Now 
			the IDF morale is low again because of the second intifada.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			Palestinian security officers in Gaza were intrigued by the logic 
			behind the Israeli killings. &quot;Our guys meet their guys and we know 
			their officers and operatives,&quot; one of the Palestinian officials 
			tells me. &quot;I tell you this frankly - they are as corrupt and 
			indisciplined as we are. And as ruthless. After they targeted 
			Mohamed Dahlan's convoy when he was coming back from security talks, 
			Dahlan talked to foreign minister Peres. &quot;Look what you guys are 
			doing to us,&quot; Dahlan told Peres. &quot;Don't you realise it was me who 
			took Sharon's son to meet Arafat?&quot; Al-Wazzir understands some of the 
			death squad logic. &quot;It has some effect because we are a 
			paternalistic society. We believe in the idea of a father figure. 
			But when they assassinated my dad, the intifada didn't stop. It was 
			affected, but all the political objectives failed. Rather than 
			demoralising the Palestinians, it fuelled the intifada. They say 
			there's now a hundred Palestinians on the murder list. No, I don't 
			think the Palestinians will adopt the same type of killings against 
			Israeli intelligence.<br>
			<br>
			&quot;An army is an institution, a system; murdering an officer just 
			results in him the great war for civilisation 573 being replaced...&quot; 
			The murder of political or military opponents was a practice the 
			Israelis honed in Lebanon where Lebanese guerrilla leaders were 
			regularly blown up by hidden bombs or shot in the back by Shin Bet 
			execution squads, often - as in the case of an Amal leader in the 
			village of Bidias - after interrogation. And all in the name of 
			&quot;security&quot;.<br>
			<br>
			Throughout the latest bloodletting, the one distinctive feature of 
			the conflict - the illegal and continuing colonisation of occupied 
			Arab land - was yet again a taboo subject, to be ignored, or 
			mentioned in passing only when Jewish settlers were killed. That 
			this was the world's last colonial conflict, in which the colonisers 
			were supported by the United States, was undiscussable, a prohibited 
			subject, something quite outside the brutality between Palestinians 
			and Israelis which was, so we had to remember, now part of America's 
			&quot;war on terror&quot;. This is what Sharon had dishonestly claimed since 
			11 September 2001. The truth, however, became clear in a revealing 
			interview Sharon gave to a French magazine in December of that year, 
			in which he recalled a telephone conversation with Jacques Chirac. 
			Sharon said he told the French president that: &quot;I was at that time 
			reading a terrible book about the Algerian war. It's a book whose 
			title reads in Hebrew: The Savage War of Peace. I know that 
			President Chirac fought as an officer during this conflict and that 
			he had himself been decorated for his courage. So, in a very 
			friendly way, I told him: 'Mr. President, you have to understand us, 
			here, it's as if we are in Algeria. We have no place to go. And 
			besides, we have no intention of leaving.'&quot;<br>
			<br>
			Sana Sersawi speaks carefully, loudly but slowly, as she recalls the 
			chaotic, dangerous, desperately tragic events that overwhelmed her 
			almost exactly 19 years ago, on 18 September 1982. As one of the 
			survivors prepared to testify against the Israeli Prime Minister 
			Ariel Sharon - who was then Israel's defence minister - she stops to 
			search her memory when she confronts the most terrible moments of 
			her life. &quot;The Lebanese Forces militia had taken us from our homes 
			and marched us up to the entrance to the camp where a large hole had 
			been dug in the earth. The men were told to get into it. Then the 
			militiamen shot a Palestinian. The women and children had climbed 
			over bodies to reach this spot, but we were truly shocked by seeing 
			this man killed in front of us and there was a roar of shouting and 
			screams from the women. That's when we heard the Israelis on 
			loudspeakers shouting, &quot;Give us the men, give us the men.&quot; We 
			thought: &quot;Thank God, they will save us.&quot; It was to prove a cruelly 
			false hope.<br>
			<br>
			Mrs Sersawi, three months pregnant, saw her 30-year-old husband 
			Hassan, and her Egyptian brother-in-law Faraj el-Sayed Ahmed 
			standing in the crowd of men. &quot;We were all told to walk up the road 
			towards the Kuwaiti embassy, the women and children in front, the 
			men behind. We had been separated. There were Phalangist militiamen 
			and Israeli soldiers walking alongside us. I could still see Hassan 
			and Faraj. It was like a parade. There were several hundred of us. 
			When we got to the Cité Sportive, the Israelis put us women in a big 
			concrete room and the men were taken to another side of the stadium. 
			There were a lot of men from the camp and I could no longer see my 
			husband. The Israelis went round saying &quot;Sit, sit.&quot; It was 11 
			o'clock. An hour later, we were told to leave. But we stood around 
			outside amid the Israeli soldiers, waiting for our men.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			Sana Sersawi waited in the bright, sweltering sun for Hassan and 
			Faraj to emerge. &quot;Some men came out, none of them younger than 40, 
			and they told us to be patient, that hundreds of men were still 
			inside. Then about four in the afternoon, an Israeli officer came 
			out. He was wearing dark glasses and said in Arabic: &quot;What are you 
			all waiting for?&quot; He said there was nobody left, that everyone had 
			gone. There were Israeli trucks moving out with tarpaulin over them. 
			We couldn't see inside. And there were Jeeps and tanks and a 
			bulldozer making a lot of noise. We stayed there as it got dark and 
			the Israelis appeared to be leaving and we were very nervous.<br>
			<br>
			&quot;But then when the Israelis had moved away, we went inside. And 
			there was no one there. Nobody. I had been only three years married. 
			I never saw my husband again.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			The smashed Camille Chamoun Sports Stadium was a natural &quot;holding 
			centre&quot; for prisoners. Only two miles from Beirut airport, it had 
			been an ammunition dump for Yasser Arafat's PLO and repeatedly 
			bombed by Israeli jets during the 1982 siege of Beirut so that its 
			giant, smashed exterior looked like a nightmare denture. The 
			Palestinians had earlier mined its cavernous interior, but its vast, 
			underground storage space and athletics changing-rooms remained 
			intact.<br>
			<br>
			It was a familiar landmark to all of us who lived in Beirut. At 
			mid-morning on 18 September 1982 - around the time Sana Sersawi says 
			she was brought to the stadium - I saw hundreds of Palestinian and 
			Lebanese prisoners, perhaps well over 1,000 in all, sitting in its 
			gloomy, cavernous interior, squatting in the dust, watched over by 
			Israeli soldiers and plainclothes Shin Beth agents and a group of 
			men who I suspected, correctly, were Lebanese collaborators. The men 
			sat in silence, obviously in fear.<br>
			<br>
			From time to time, I noted, a few were taken away. They were put 
			into Israeli army trucks or jeeps or Phalangist vehicles - for 
			further &quot;interrogation&quot;. Nor did I doubt this. A few hundred metres 
			away, up to 600 massacre victims of the Sabra and Chatila 
			Palestinian refugee camps rotted in the sun, the stench of 
			decomposition drifting over the prisoners and their captors alike. 
			It was suffocatingly hot. Loren Jenkins of The Washington Post, Paul 
			Eedle of Reuters and I had only got into the cells because the 
			Israelis assumed - given our Western appearance - that we must have 
			been members of Shin Beth. Many of the prisoners had their heads 
			bowed.<br>
			<br>
			Arab prisoners usually adopted this pose of humiliation. But 
			Israel's militiamen had been withdrawn from the camps, their 
			slaughter over, and at least the Israeli army was now in charge. So 
			what did these men have to fear?<br>
			<br>
			Looking back - and listening to Sana Sersawi today - I shudder now 
			at our innocence. My notes of the time contain some ominous clues. 
			We found a Lebanese employee of Reuters, Abdullah Mattar, among the 
			prisoners and obtained his release, Paul leading him away with his 
			arm around the man's shoulders. &quot;They take us away, one by one, for 
			interrogation,&quot; one of the prisoners muttered to me. &quot;They are 
			Haddad militiamen. Usually they bring the people back after 
			interrogation, but not always. Sometimes the people do not return.&quot; 
			Then an Israeli officer ordered me to leave. Why couldn't the 
			prisoners talk to me? I asked. &quot;They can talk if they want,&quot; he 
			replied. &quot;But they have nothing to say.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			All the Israelis knew what had happened inside the camps. The smell 
			of the corpses was now overpowering. Outside, a Phalangist Jeep with 
			the words &quot;Military Police&quot; painted on it - if so exotic an 
			institution could be associated with this gang of murderers - drove 
			by. A few television crews had turned up. One filmed the Lebanese 
			Christian militiamen outside the Cité Sportive. He also filmed a 
			woman pleading to an Israeli army colonel called &quot;Yahya&quot; for the 
			release of her husband. The colonel has now been positively 
			identified by The Independent. Today, he is a general in the Israeli 
			army.<br>
			<br>
			Along the main road opposite the stadium there was a line of Israeli 
			Merkava tanks, their crews sitting on the turrets, smoking, watching 
			the men being led from the stadium in ones or twos, some being set 
			free, others being led away by Shin Beth men or by Lebanese men in 
			drab khaki overalls. All these soldiers knew what had happened 
			inside the camps. One, Lt Avi Grabovsky - he was later to testify to 
			the Israeli Kahan commission - had even witnessed the murder of 
			several civilians the previous day and had been told not to 
			&quot;interfere&quot;.<br>
			<br>
			And in the days that followed, strange reports reached us. A girl 
			had been dragged from a car in Damour by Phalangist militiamen and 
			taken away, despite her appeals to a nearby Israeli soldier. Then 
			the cleaning lady of a Lebanese woman who worked for a US television 
			chain complained bitterly that Israelis had arrested her husband. He 
			was never seen again.<br>
			<br>
			There were other vague rumours of &quot;disappeared&quot; people. I wrote in 
			my notes at the time that &quot;even after Chatila, Israel's 'terrorist' 
			enemies were being liquidated in West Beirut.&quot; But I had not 
			directly associated this dark conviction with the Cité Sportive. I 
			had not even reflected on the fearful precedents of a sports stadium 
			in time of war. Hadn't there been a sports stadium in Santiago a few 
			years before, packed with prisoners after Pinochet's coup d'état, a 
			stadium from which many prisoners never returned?<br>
			<br>
			Among the testimonies gathered by lawyers seeking to indict Ariel 
			Sharon for war crimes is that of Wadha al-Sabeq. On Friday 17 
			September 1982, she said, while the massacre was still - unknown to 
			her - under way inside Sabra and Chatila, she was in her home with 
			her family in Bir Hassan, just opposite the camps. &quot;Neighbours came 
			and said the Israelis wanted to stamp our ID cards, so we went 
			downstairs and we saw both Israelis and Lebanese forces on the road. 
			The men were separated from the women.&quot; This separation - with its 
			awful shadow of similar separations at Srebrenica during the Bosnian 
			war - was a common feature of these mass arrests. &quot;We were told to 
			go to the Cité Sportive. The men stayed put.&quot; Among the men were 
			Wadha's two sons, 19-year-old Mohamed and 16-year-old Ali and her 
			brother Mohamed. &quot;We went to the Cité Sportive, as the Israelis told 
			us,&quot; she says. &quot;I never saw my sons or brother again.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			The survivors tell distressingly similar stories. Bahija Zrein says 
			she was ordered by an Israeli patrol to go to the Cité Sportive and 
			the men with her, including her 22-year-old brother, were taken 
			away. Some militiamen - watched by the Israelis - loaded him into a 
			car, blindfolded, she says.<br>
			<br>
			&quot;That's how he disappeared,&quot; she says in her official testimony, 
			&quot;and I have never seen him again since.&quot; It was only a few days 
			afterwards that we journalists began to notice a discrepancy in the 
			figures of dead. While up to 600 bodies had been found inside Sabra 
			and Chatila, 1,800 civilians had been reported as &quot;missing&quot;. We 
			assumed - how easy assumptions are in war --that they had been 
			killed in the three days between 16 September 1982 and the 
			withdrawal of the Phalangist killers on 18 September, and that their 
			corpses had been secretly buried outside the camp. Beneath the golf 
			course, we suspected. The idea that many of these young people had 
			been murdered outside the camps or after 18 September, that the 
			killings were still going on while we walked through the camps, 
			never occurred to us.<br>
			<br>
			Why did we journalists at the time not think of this? The following 
			year, the Israeli Kahan commission published its report, condemning 
			Sharon but ending its own inquiry of the atrocity on 18 September, 
			with just a one-line hint - unexplained - that several hundred 
			people may have &quot;disappeared around the same time&quot;. The commission 
			interviewed no Palestinian survivors but it was allowed to become 
			the narrative of history.<br>
			<br>
			The idea that the Israelis went on handing over prisoners to their 
			bloodthirsty militia allies never occurred to us. The Palestinians 
			of Sabra and Chatila are now giving evidence that this is exactly 
			what happened. One man, Abdel Nasser Alameh, believes his brother 
			Ali was handed to the Phalange on the morning of 18 September. A 
			Palestinian Christian woman called Milaneh Boutros has recorded how, 
			in a truck-load of women and children, she was taken from the camps 
			to the Christian town of Bikfaya, the home of the newly assassinated 
			Christian President-elect Bashir Gemayel, where a grief-stricken 
			Christian woman ordered the execution of a 13-year-old boy in the 
			truck. He was shot. The truck must have passed at least four Israeli 
			checkpoints on its way to Bikfaya. And heaven spare me, I had even 
			met the woman who ordered the boy's execution.<br>
			<br>
			Even before the slaughter inside the camps had ended, Shahira Abu 
			Rudeina says she was taken to the Cité Sportive where, in one of the 
			underground &quot;holding centres&quot;, she saw a retarded man, watched by 
			Israeli soldiers, burying bodies in a pit. Her evidence might be 
			rejected were it not for the fact that she also expressed her 
			gratitude for an Israeli soldier - inside the Chatila camp, against 
			all the evidence given by the Israelis - who prevented the murder of 
			her daughters by the Phalange.<br>
			<br>
			Long after the war, the ruins of the Cité Sportive were torn down 
			and a brand new marble stadium was built in its place, partly by the 
			British. Pavarotti has sung there. But the testimony of what may lie 
			beneath its foundations - and its frightful implications - will give 
			Ariel Sharon further reason to fear an indictment.<br>
			<br>
			I had been in the Sabra and Chatila camps when these crimes took 
			place. I had returned to the camps, year after year, to try to 
			discover what happened to the missing thousand men. Karsten Tveit of 
			Norwegian television had been with me in 1982 and he had returned to 
			Beirut many times with the same purpose. Lawyers weren't the only 
			people investigating these crimes against humanity. In 2001, Tveit 
			arrived in Lebanon with the original 1982 tapes of those women 
			pleading for their menfolk at the gates of the Cité Sportive. He 
			visited the poky little video shops in the present-day camp and 
			showed and reshowed the tapes until local Palestinians identified 
			them; then Tveit set off to find the women - 19 years older now - 
			who were on the tape, who had asked for their sons and brothers and 
			fathers and husbands outside the Cité Sportive. He traced them all. 
			None had ever seen their loved ones again.<br>
