       The Official Website of Representative David Duke, PhD  5/2/2004 Ariel Sharon: The terrorist who aided the 9-11 Attack!  Posted under: General   — @ 5:51 pm        David Duke Internet Radio Report Ariel Sharon: The terrorist who aided the 9-11 Attack! By David Duke Broadcast Date 05/02/2002 http://www.davidduke.com/radio Today, I want to focus on the world’s most dangerous and murderous terrorist. His name is Ariel Sharon, and he makes Osama Bin Laden look like an amateur when it comes to murder and mayhem. But first, there is a pressing matter that needs to be addressed. In the Palestinian refugee camp of Jenin, the stench of hundreds of rotting human bodies fills the air. Surviving mothers and fathers search through the rubble of hundreds of homes to recover the remains of their sons and daughters. And, sons and daughters wander dazed through the carnage trying to find their mothers and fathers and grandmothers and grandfathers. Thousands of young men have taken away by Israel and at this moment suffer terrible torture in Israel’s concentration camps. However, their cries of anguish and pain will not be heard by any of us. Even after the complete destruction of this refugee camp, even as hundreds lay injured and without food, water, electricity, even as mothers had to watch their children die slowly from their wounds, Israel would not permit any Red Cross or other relief agencies into the camp. Even the world’s press was kept out. Of course, there was only one reason for keeping out the eyes and ears of the world: Israeli war criminals had to work hard to cover up their horrendous crimes at Jenin. They wanted the world to see no pictures of those murdered and maimed. Strange isn’t it, that even 55 years since the end of the Second World War, the Jewish supremacists still show us almost daily the poignant pictures of Jewish bodies in Nazi concentration camps, but they are ever so anxious that world does not see the mass murdered Palestinian victims of Zionism – murders that are happening right now! Of course, they graphically show us any Israeli killed or injured by suicide bombers. But you will not see the bodies and the blood of 100 Palestinians men women and children who die for every one Israeli. You won’t see the thousands of Palestinians imprisoned and tortured by Israel. Don’t expect the Palestinian victims of Israeli torture who survive — to be interviewed by the Jewish-controlled American press. Palestinian civilians — men, women and children — are being maimed and murdered by Israel in our own time, in our own world, many at this very moment. And the man behind this murder it is none other than Ariel Sharon.  As a loyal and patriotic American, my heart grieves at the support given by American traitors to the world’s worst mass murderer and war criminal Ariel Sharon. Sharon has killed, maimed and tortured more people than Osama Bin Laden could only fantasize about. In fact, I will present to you compelling evidence that Sharon and the Mossad aided and abetted the horrible terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. By supporting Sharon and his criminal government in Israel, American traitors have not only supported Sharon’s crimes against the Palestinian people, and have become accomplices in mass murder and torture, but they directly aided terrorists who have inflicted terrorism on America. American traitors who support Israel have damaged our most vital interests in the world and caused Americans to be hated the world over. If you think I am exaggerating when I say Sharon is even worse than Osama Bin Laden, please listen carefully to this broadcast, keep an open mind, and please, please check out every piece of evidence I offer here. Forget what the Jewish press says about me and focus on the evidence I offer. I will provide you the sources of everything I say here. Many of my references are themselves from major Jewish sources. Today I want to sketch a short history of Sharon’s 50 years of crimes against humanity, from his massacre at Kibya, through his invasion of Lebanon and his massacre at Sabre and Shatila, to his mass murder of men, women and children in the refugee camp at Jenin, Palestine. And as I said, I will offer compelling evidence of Sharon’s complicity in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. Sharon could be tried for any of a dozen of other massacres committed during his murderous career. His crimes against humanity go back at least as far as 1953. The Israeli newspaper, Ha’aretz, recalls Sharon’s leading of a massacre in the village of Kibya in 1953. I quote from Ha’aretz, “The soldiers of Major Ariel Sharon killed 70 Palestinians in the reprisal raid, most of them women and children.” In Israel, the most brutal, the most extreme and bloodthirsty terrorists are always elevated to Israel’s top leadership. Even before Sharon became Prime Minister, the vicious terrorists responsible for blowing up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem and the massacre at Dier Yassin — Yitshak Shamir and Menachem Begin became Israel’s prime ministers. The Palestinians, of course, have faced 50 years of unrelenting Israeli terror. In fact, Israel carved its state out of Palestinian land through a deliberate policy of mass terror against the Palestinians. It was the method by which they drove 800,000 of them from their homes, businesses and farms. In his book The Revolt, former Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, boasts about his role in the massacre of the 254 Palestinians at Dier Yassin. (Most of the victims were women, children and the elderly who remained in an Israeli-occupied village.) The International Red Cross Representative described how the Jewish terrorists actually cut the babies from the wombs of many pregnant Palestinian women. In his book Begin points out that sheer horror of the Dier Yassin and other sadistic massacres caused panic among the residents, causing them to flee in terror from their homes. This intentional mass terror enabled the Zionists to take control of Palestine. Sharon led the brutal invasion and occupation of Lebanon. Many consider that invasion and brutal occupation as one of the blackest marks on Israeli history, as it resulted in the death of at least 17,000 people, mostly civilians, and perhaps is best annotated by the massacre of 1,500 civilians at the Sabra and Chatila camps in Beirut. To prevent any escape, Sharon had his troops surround these Israeli built concentration camps. Sharon let in the Phalangist forces, which then proceeded to murder hundreds of men, women and children. Even the Israeli Kahan Commission found Sharon quote “personally responsible” for the massacre. All night the shooting and killing and screaming went on while Israeli troops listened gleefully to the slaughter, not raising a finger to stop it. Even after the initial slaughter, many of the men were transported to the Beirut football stadium and then murdered in cold blood by the Israeli troops. A Belgium court is attempting to try Sharon for his crimes against humanity in Lebanon and Sharon will not even step foot in that country for fear of arrest. Since this case has heated up there have been the deaths of three key, potential witnesses against Sharon. I quote from the world-renowned British journalist, Robert Fisk of the Independent. “Why would anyone want to car-bomb the former Lebanese Phalangist militia leader and government minister Elie Hobeika in Beirut – less than two days after he agreed to give evidence against Mr Sharon in a Belgian court, which may try the Israeli leader for the murder of up to 1,700 Palestinian civilians in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps in September, 1982?” Even more recently, a key witness against Sharon, another Lebanese Phalangist who had command knowledge of the killings at Sabra and Chatila was gunned down along with his wife in Brazil by someone using a silenced pistol. In Lebanon, 17,000 civilians were killed. More than a hundred thousand homes were destroyed; at least 100,000 civilians were wounded or maimed. Even more were left homeless. Israel violated United Nations resolutions by aggressively invading and occupying Lebanon. Even the United States supported resolutions denoting Israel as violating international law and demanding Israel withdrawal. The invasion and murder in Lebanon led by Sharon caused the deaths of about 6 times more people than the World Trade Center attacks and involved the deaths and maiming of thousands of more children. The Israeli bombs in Lebanon fell not just upon places of work such as the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, but upon homes. To illustrate the incredible barbarity of this supreme terrorist, I will quote directly from an interview Sharon did with the respected Israeli Journalist, Amos Os, in 1982, which can be found in the Israeli daily Davar and can be authenticated by many other Jewish sources. When Oz interviewed Sharon, Sharon obviously directed his reponses to liberal Jews in Israel, probably not dreaming it would get to the outside world. Here are some direct quotes from Sharon the interview. “Even if you’ll prove to me by mathematical means that the present war in Lebanon is a dirty immoral war, I don’t care. Moreover, even if you will prove to me that we have not achieved and will not achieve any of our aims in Lebanon, that we will neither create a friendly regime in Lebanon nor destroy the Syrians or even the PLO, even then I don’t care. It was still worth it. Even if Galilee is shelled again by Katyushas in a year’s time, I don’t really care. We shall start another war, kill and destroy more and more, until they will have had enough. “Tell me, do the baddies of this world have a bad time? If anyone tries to touch them, the evil men cut his hands and legs off. They hunt and catch whatever they feel like eating. They don’t suffer from indigestion and are not punished by Heaven. I want Israel to join that club. Maybe the world will then at last begin to fear me instead of feeling sorry for me. Maybe they will start to tremble, to fear my madness instead of admiring my nobility. Thank god for that. Let them tremble, let them call us a mad state. Let them understand that we are a wild country, dangerous to our surroundings, not normal, that we might go crazy if one of our children is murdered – just one! That we might go wild and burn all the oil fields in the Middle East! I…Let them be aware in Washington, Moscow, Damascus and China that if one of our ambassadors is shot, or even a consul or the most junior embassy official, we might start World War Three just like that! “If your nice civilized parents had come here in time instead of writing books about the love for humanity and singing Hear O Israel on the way to the gas chambers, …now don’t be shocked, if they instead had killed six million Arabs here or even one million, what would have happened? Sure, two or three nasty pages would have been written in the history books, we would have been called all sorts of names, but we could be here today as a people of 25 million! “Even today I am willing to volunteer to do the dirty work for Israel, to kill as many Arabs as necessary, to deport them, to expel and burn them, to have everyone hate us, to pull the rug from underneath the feet of the Diaspora Jews, so that they will be forced to run to us crying. Even if it means blowing up one or two synagogues here and there, I don’t care. And I don’t mind if after the job is done you put me in front of a Nuremberg Trial and then jail me for life. Hang me if you want, as a war criminal… What you lot don’t understand is that the dirty work of Zionism is not finished yet, far from it.” Sharon made these statements in 1982 and right now in 2002 he is attempting to finish the dirty work of Zionism. Notice the attitude Sharon expresses in the interview. He endorses genocide, he threatens World War III; he is utterly ruthless and contemptuous of anyone or anything other than the Jewish people. Note that he also doesn’t care if some Jews die in the process, and hatred against Jews rises in the world. In fact that is precisely what he wants, so as to make them either support Israel more fully or emigrate to Israel. It is from this backdrop that we must begin to look into the 9-11 terrorist attacks on America. The Mossad has had a long history of covert terrorism and treachery against the United States. In the 1950s, Mossad agents of Israel blew up American installations in Egypt in an elaborate scheme to blame Egyptians for the terrorism against America and thus garner American support against Egypt. Fortunately for the United States and for Egypt, one of the Jewish agent’s bombs went off prematurely, and the plot was exposed. The Israeli Defense Minister, Pinhas Lavon had to resign because of the ensuing scandal. During the 1967 war, Israel covertly attacked an American naval vessel, the USS Liberty, with unmarked planes and torpedo boats in an attempt to sink the ship and again — blame the Egyptians for the massacre; 34 Americans were killed and 173 wounded. It was only the courage and resourcefulness of the crew that saved the ship and exposed Israel’s role in the attack. The two American officials who were in the best position to know at the time, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Thomas Moorer, have both stated that the murderous attack by Israel against the American ship was deliberate. The attack was aggressively covered up by both the government and the media in America. Officers and crews were ordered not to give any media interviews. When the captain of the USS Liberty, William MacDougal, was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, for the first time in one hundred years the medal was not awarded at the White House, but given quietly at the Naval Yard; traitors in Washington didn’t want the American people to know about this Israeli act of terrorism and murder against Americans. Imagine if after the attack on Pearl Harbor the award of the Congressional Medal of Honor was done so quietly so as not to cause anger against the Japanese, and imagine men in Congress and the White House who still wanted to give arms and American money to the Japanese! That is exactly the kind of treason going on in America right now! Israel has also continuously committed espionage against the United States. One of Israel’s spies, Jonathan Pollard, did more damage to the United States than probably any other spy in history. Israel treacherously passed Pollard’s information to the Soviets and our entire intelligence apparatus in Europe was devastated. Through this treachery, Israel caused the murder of many of America’s loyal agents in Eastern Europe. So, Israel has a long record of both terrorism and treachery against the United States of America. Then last year, in 2001, Ariel Sharon, the world’s worst terrorist, became Israel’s Prime Minister. Sharon pledged from the beginning to overturn the Oslo agreements. He has always been in favor of expelling the Palestinians and annexing the West Bank and Gaza for Israel. And Sharon has always been one of the most ruthless murderers in the world, willing to do anything to advance his cause. With this in mind, let’s recap the year 2001 up until the Trade Center Bombing. 2001 was a very bad year for Israel. The election of Sharon to Prime Minister was turning much of the world against Israel. The shooting down of protesting children on the West Bank was turning world opinion against Israel. Many nations were beginning to formally recognize the new nation of Palestine. Sharon himself faced a war crimes tribunal in Belgium. Sharon and the hawks of Israel were desperate. Here is the scenario that I believed occurred. Sharon was desperate to create a new covert incident like the Lavon affair and the attack on the Liberty. He needed a Lavon Affair that would not go wrong. Sharon desperately needed a horrendous event to turn around the world and give him free reign against the Palestinians. He found his opportunity in Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida. Because of Israel’s relentless crimes against Palestine and American support for Israel, Sharon knew that a part of bin Laden’s organization could be guided into a horrendous action against America. The Mossad prides itself on deep infiltration and penetration into every Arab militant group in the world. For years, Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida has been considered the most dangerous group operating against Israel. There can be no doubt that deep penetration of this organization was one of the Mossad’s priorities over the past decade. The 9-11 attacks required tremendous planning and coordination requiring many participants. According to FBI investigators, at least one hundred al-Qaida in America, in the Mideast and in Europe were involved strategically in the 9-11 attacks. We now have proof that the Mossad had penetrated al-Qaida even here in the United States. We even have some of the names and addresses of some of the Israeli agents who were closely monitoring the operation and its Al-Qaida leader in America, Mohammed Atta. A recently released report by the American DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency), shows that Israeli spies in the United States were closely monitoring at least half of the hijackers immediately prior to the attacks. In fact, 5 Israeli agents actually lived on the same street as the leader of the operation, Mohammed Atta. Israel obviously had big involvement in what went on, if at least five Israeli spies were monitoring just one of the leaders. As monstrous as it may seem, Sharon and the extremists of Israel needed the 9-11 attacks to mobilize Americans against their enemies and give Israel a free hand in dealing with the Palestinians. It was an easy operation for Israel’s top agents inside al-Qaida to propose and plan this terrorist operation for the fanatical Muslims yearned to strike back at America for supporting the crimes of Israel. Unlike the Lavon Affair and the Attack on the USS Liberty in which Israeli agents and forces did the attacking, how much easier and safer it is for them to direct their enemies to do their dirty work! Of course, Sharon and the Mossad knew that only Israel would benefit from the attacks, and that this horrible attack against American citizens would set back the Palestinian and the whole Arab cause tremendously. (Which of course it has.) There is other compelling evidence of Mossad involvement in the 9-11 attacks. Two hours prior to the attack, messages were sent to Israeli firms and employees with offices in Israel and the WTC of the impending attack. The FBI admitted it was investigating the messages received and sent through the Israeli firm Odigo. Secondly, the Israeli death toll in the WTC was impossibly low, unless at least some Israeli nationals were warned. Israel’s leading newspaper, The Jerusalem Post, the day after the attacks headlined that 4000 Israelis were believed to be in the area of the WTC. The involvement of large numbers of Israeli nationals in the banking, brokerage, finance and international trade business at the WTC was legendary. Even the co-owner ot the WTC is himself an Israeli citizen! So even if The Jerusalem Post estimated number of Israelis at the WTC was too high, the actual Israeli death toll at the WTC turned out to be only one. That’s right only one, an impossibly low number, unless at least some Israelis were warned of the impending attack. Who could have warned some of the Israelis at the WTC? Again, we know that the Mossad was, in fact, closely monitoring the hijackers, and can be certain to have penetrated the leadership of al-Qaida. Carl Cameron, reporting on the Brit Hume Show on the Fox News Network, revealed the existence of a huge Israeli spy ring in the United States prior to 9-11. He stated that U.S. officials believe that Israel knew details of 9-11 prior to the attack that they did not share that vital information with the U.S. Whether or not the Israeli Mossad actually engineered the attacks, or simply knew about them in advance, Sharon and Israel must be held accountable for the deaths of thousands of Americans in the September attacks. Purposely not warning American authorities and letting the attacks go on was one of the worst acts of treachery in the history of nations. When the radical Jewish supremacist, Benjamin Netanyahu, was asked by the New York Times what he thought of the attack, he blurted out, “It’s very good,” but then edited his comments by saying “well, not very good, but it will generate immediate sympathy.” Yes, of course, for Israel. In the flames and death and rubble of the WTC and the Pentagon, Israel got everything it wanted. The Palestinians, on the verge of their internationally recognized state, were set back many years in their efforts for freedom. Thousands have been killed, thousands of homes destroyed, tens of thousands of Palestinians imprisoned and tortured, and America is now poised to go to war against Israel’s enemies. And the plans are to attack not just the al-Qaida, but Iran and Iraq as well. And, Ariel Sharon was free to commit unrestrained crimes against the Palestinian people, with no fear of any serious reprisals from the United States or anyone else. And of course, Sharon has done just that. A perfect example what Israel can do since the 9-11 attack is the attack on Jenin. It sent in dozens of explosive missiles, helicopter gunships firing millions of rounds of high-powered ammunition into the densely-packed city, it ordered massive bulldozing of homes and schools and offices, detention and torture of hundreds of Palestinians, and then not letting in ambulances or relief services while hundreds of civilians were hurt or wounded. In the United States we are still not getting the full story of Jenin. The American, Israeli-partisan press is not the least bit suspicious that Israel had banned any press from the city and wouldn’t allow anyone into the city for many days while they worked to cover up the evidence of their crimes against humanity. Reporter Phil Reeves wrote for London’s The Independent, and I quote: “A monstrous war crime that Israel has tried to cover up for a fortnight has finally been exposed. Its troops have caused devastation in the centre of the Jenin refugee camp, reached yesterday by The Independent, where thousands of people are still living amid the ruins. . . . The sweet and ghastly smell of rotting human corpses is everywhere, evidence that it is a human tomb. The people who spent days hiding in basements crowded into single rooms as the rockets pounded in say there are hundreds of corpses entombed beneath the dust, under a field of debris, criss-crossed with tank and bulldozer treadmarks. . . . A quiet, sad-looking young man . . . led us across the wasteland, littered now with the detritus of what were once households, foam rubber, torn clothes, shoes, tin cans, children’s toys. He suddenly stopped. This was a mass grave, he said, pointing. . . . We could not see the bodies, but we could smell them. . . . Until two weeks ago there were several hundred tightly packed homes in this neighbourhood . . . . They no longer exist. Around the central ruins there are many hundreds of half-wrecked homes. Much of the camp — once home to 15,000 Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war — is falling down. Every wall is speckled and torn with bullet holes and shrapnel, testimony of the awesome, random firepower of Cobra and Apache helicopters that hovered over the camp. Building after building has been torn apart, their contents . . . spewed out into the road. Every other building bears the giant, charred impact mark of a helicopter missile. Last night there were still many families and weeping children living amid the ruins, cut off from humanitarian aid. Ominously, we found no wounded . . . . Israel was still trying to, conceal these scenes yesterday. It had refused entry to Red Cross ambulances for nearly a week, in violation of the Geneva Convention. Yesterday it continued to try to keep us out. . . . Hidden, whispering people directed us through narrow alleys they thought were clear. When there were soldiers about, a finger would raise in warning, or a hand waved us back. We were welcomed by people desperate to tell what had happened. They spoke of executions and bulldozers wrecking homes with people inside. . . . Rajib Ahmed, from the Palestinian Energy Authority, came to try to repair the power lines. He was trembling with fury and shock. ‘This is mass murder. . . . ” All had the same message: tell the world.” — end of quote - Ariel Sharon is the world’s worst terrorist. As I have said, he has killed many more thousands of people than Osama bin Laden, wounded and tortured hundreds of thousands more than bin Laden. The shocking evidence is also clear that Sharon not only has responsibility for the murders at Sabra and Chatila, but also for the September 11 attacks against the United States. Just as he was fully aware of the murderous intentions of the Phalangist in the Sabra and Chatila massacre, he also had advance knowledge of the September 11 massacre of thousands of Americans. Prior warnings to Israelis at the World Trade Center prove that fact. Only American traitors would cover up the treacherous role of Israel in the September 11 attacks. Only traitors would not prosecute over a hundred captured Israeli spies and send them back to Israel so that the truth of Israeli’s role in the attacks could be hidden. Only traitors would lend American support to Israel’s horrible crimes against the Palestinian people, crimes against humanity. Crimes that not only are a strike against the American sense of justice, but crimes that damage our country all over the world and will make us subject to more terrorism in the future. I tremble for America, my country. I anguish over our loss of independence and freedom to evil Jewish supremacists such as the mass murderer and war criminal Ariel Sharon. I pray for justice and I pray for peace. My heart goes out to the tens of thousands of unnamed Palestinians who suffer at this moment in their beloved land. I also pray for those innocent Jews who are paying the price for the terrorism of Sharon and other Jewish supremacists. And I pray for the American people that we may break this treason against our people and betrayal of all the lofty founding principles of our beloved nation. Back to home page Footnotes 1. Ha’aretz.
