Andersen, 40, is the grand prize winner of the national Smucker's Skating Party contest, which is a promotion the company put on to commemorate the 25th anniversary tour of Smucker's Stars on Ice. The promotion ran from Dec. 20 through Feb. 18. The party is the closest the stars will come to St. Louis on their tour, which will conclude April 9 in Bridgeport, Conn. St. Louis was not among the 25 cities on this year's tour, which began Nov. 28 in Lake Placid, N.Y. Andersen has two sons:  Luke , 8, and  Elias , 5. She is married to  Blake Andersen and says the skating party will include nine adults and 17 of Luke's friends from the Metro Edge Figure Skating Club, which skates at the Webster Groves rink. The Smucker's Stars on Ice tour was founded in 1986 by skating icon  Scott Hamilton . It has played more than 1,000 shows over the past 25 years and has won three Emmy awards and an ACE Cable Award for best sports special.     Copyright 2011 STLtoday.com. All rights reserved.
