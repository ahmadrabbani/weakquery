Sasha Cohen Quote " There is nothing more satisfying than getting off the ice and knowing you have become a better skater that day. "   77  Sex Appeal Judged by some to be the hottest woman in sports in 2003, Sasha Cohen is one of a rare breed of athletes who can match her sports success with sex appeal. Her modeling work has confirmed that, showing admirers a woman who is both vivacious and enticing. However, Sasha's sexiness isn't for everyone; petite figure skaters aren't exactly bosomy sexpots exuding old-fashioned femininity. While we're willing to embrace (in more ways than one) every lovely variation of the female form, we confess that Sasha's not the  Maxim or  Play .. boy pinup type.    87 Success Sasha Cohen has fought her way to the top of the international figure skating world -- no small feat. She was the Grand Prix Champion in 2003, the US National Silver Medalist four times out of six between 2000 and 2005, and has been the World Silver Medalist in 2004 and 2005. While she has yet to win an Olympic medal, she has beaten every Olympic medalist who remains eligible since her fourth-place finish in Salt Lake City in 2002. Sasha's consistent ranking with the top female skaters in the world certainly makes her name instantly recognizable in the skating world. Her appearances in  Vogue, Seventeen, Teen People , and the high-fashion French mag  V (for which she was photographed by world-famous photographer Mario Sorrenti) have given her a second career as a model and raised her profile within the broader public. A win at the upcoming Olympics or World Championships would be the last step in making her a household name.   Sasha Cohen Biography    Alexandra Pauline "Sasha" Cohen was born on October 26, 1984, in Westwood, California. Her mother, Galina, is a ballerina who emigrated from Ukraine; it's thanks to her that Sasha has her nickname ("Sasha" is a common Slavic shortening of Alexander or Alexandra) and can speak fluent Russian. Rounding out Sasha's immediate family is her father Roger Cohen and her younger sister Natasha, an aspiring pianist. Sasha's first competitive sport was gymnastics, which she practiced as a very young girl; she eventually made it to level five. When Sasha was 7, she switched to figure skating, to which she applied herself with thousands of hours of hard work and training throughout the 1990s. As early as the age of 12, she began to compete in the Southwest Pacific Regionals and Pacific Coast Sectionals, consistently placing in the top five. By 1999, she had placed first in both these competitions, won the Gardena Winter Trophy, and placed second at the US Junior National Championships.  sasha cohen at the 2002 olympics  Sasha first came to national prominence the following year, when she won the silver medal at the US National Championships. A back injury kept Sasha from competing in the National Championships in 2001, but she was back in 2002, winning another silver and qualifying for the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. At the Olympics, her first major international competition, she just missed a medal, placing fourth. During the opening ceremonies, she was among the athletes who sat beside  George W. Bush , and even made headlines when she asked the President to say "hi" to her mother on her cell phone. In the summer of 2002, Sasha graduated from Futures High School with a straight-A record. She left California and her coach John Nicks for Simsbury, Connecticut to train with Russian coach Tatiana Tarasova.  sasha cohen wins an international title  In 2003, Sasha won the Grand Prix Final, earning her first international title, and she placed fourth overall at the 2003 World Championships. The 2002-2003 season was her best yet. The next year was more uneven. Sasha came on strong early in the season, but falls in the ABC Winter Challenge and the Grand Prix cost her. In early 2004, she moved to Hackensack, New Jersey, to train with Robin Wagner, who had coached Sarah Hughes to the Olympic gold in 2002. Sasha's performances picked up again, and she won silver at both the National and World Championships; she also won the 2004 Marshalls World Challenge with a flawless seven-triple free skate. A flare-up of Sasha's back injury marred her 2004-2005 season, forcing her to withdraw from Grand Prix events and causing a disappointing third-place finish at the 2004 Marshalls World Cup. In December 2004, Sasha returned to California and her friends and family, and was once again coached by John Nicks.  sasha cohen the figure skater  Sasha's record for 2005 includes second-place finishes in the US National Championships, the World Championships, and the Marshalls US Figure Skating Challenge. She is planning to compete in the 2005 Grand Prix in Tokyo, as well as the 2006 Olympics in Torino, and the 2006 World Championships in Calgary. Sasha continues to make Orange County, California her base; she recently bought a house near the beach and she has also written an autobiography,  Fire on Ice: Autobiography of a Champion Figure Skater (2005).
