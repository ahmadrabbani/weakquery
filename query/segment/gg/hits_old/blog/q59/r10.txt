Skip to next paragraph       Keep up with the latest news as the 2010 Winter Games approach. Go to the Rings Blog �     Just five days before she was to compete in the short program at Skate America in Lake Placid, N.Y., she withdrew, citing nagging tendinitis in her right calf. The injury also caused Cohen to pull out of a Grand Prix event last month in Paris. She has not skated in competition since placing third at the world championships in March 2006. Cohen , 25, said Friday that she expected to compete at Skate America, but a visit to her orthopedic surgeon Monday stymied those plans. “It was determined that in order for me to fully recover, I should not compete this week,” Cohen said in a statement  released by United States Figure Skating . She added that she was “very disappointed.” Emily Hughes , who finished  seventh at the 2006 Turin Olympics , will replace Cohen at Skate America. She attended Harvard the last two years, but is taking time off to train for the 2010 Vancouver Games. Hughes said she was thrilled to have the opportunity to compete this weekend. For Cohen, however, the opportunities to compete at a major event before the United States figure skating championships have disappeared. Now the first competition in her comeback will be  the nationals , which begin Jan. 15 in Spokane, Wash. Those championships will play a major role in determining which skaters will be named to the Olympic team. “I’m probably at 60 or 70 percent right now, and this isn’t when I’m going to peak,” she said in a telephone interview last week, referring to Skate America. “I want to be skating well at nationals, so that’s my main goal. Until then, it’s been an interesting period of my life, a real challenge.” Cohen  announced in May that she would train full time for the 2010 Olympics. At Vancouver, the United States will have only two spots in women’s figure skating because of the team’s mediocre showing at the 2009 world championships. The last time the team sent only two women to skate in the Olympics was in 1994, when  Nancy Kerrigan won the silver medal at the Lillehammer Games. At a time when the United States women appear to be regrouping, instead of dominating, Cohen is expected to bring experience to the mix.  She has been  training with Rafael Arutunian , who used to coach  Michelle Kwan . She was coached by John Nicks for most of her earlier competitive career. Cohen said she made the coaching change because she wanted to become a more powerful skater; her jumps have long been thought to be a weakness. Arutunian, who did not return phone calls, would help her do that, she said. Cohen, known for her flexibility and grace, said her jumps had been improving, even though she had taken a week off last month to nurse her calf injury. But finding consistency has been a challenge. “I have to ask myself: What kind of person am I? Am I going to fight through this or give up?” she said. “It’s definitely harder as you get older and after such a long break. Dealing with injuries is frustrating.” More Articles in Sports »  A version of this article appeared in print on November 10, 2009, on page B19 of the New York edition.
