CNET Editors' review by:  Jessica Dolcourt  on March 16, 2010  The Opera Mobile browser has long been a top alternative to Internet Explorer on Windows phones. This latest overhaul streamlines the full Web browser, making it graphically rich, simpler to use, and even more in tune with Opera's desktop browser. For example, the browser opens with Speed Dial, a customizable collection of thumbnail images that link to your favorite sites. To make programming these bookmarks even more automatic, users of Opera on other devices (like the desktop) can sign on via Opera Link and sync bookmarks, Speed Dial, and history between the browsers. Inside you'll find tabbed browsing, a password manager, and a download manager. You can search within a page, download images, and bookmark pages. You can copy text and easily feed that into a search. We still wish Opera would combine the search bar with the address bar, however, and we miss being able to create a custom search engine from a favorite site. Video playback is another snag; Opera won't transcode video, but can play from mobile optimized sites like YouTube for mobile phones. Overall, performance is solid and the app runs smoothly. Opera Mobile sits comfortably ahead of the current competition on Windows phones.      Citrix XenServer  XenServer is enterprise-class, cloud-proven and FREE.

With panning and zooming options, the user is able to focus on specific page content. With a click, users can simply save pages and images to their phones. Surf the Web on a mobile phone as easily as on a desktop computer. Whichever phone you have, a smooth user experience awaits.

Summary Not ready for primetime on windows mobile 6.1 smartphone with a keyboard...I have installed this many times all with the same results. Pretty much blows if you cannot type in a web site, use the tabs, or control the settings. Reply to this review   Was this review helpful?

I would love to try out this browser but have been unable to. I am not very happy with Internet Explorer on my phone. I had regular Opera Mini before downloading Opera 10. Now I don't have either one. Opera 10 alway's come's up if I try to do anything on the internet so now I can't get anything on the internet at all.
