Keypad hot keys speed up zooming and scrolling. The browser comes with a familiar mouse. You can create your own search shortcuts, synchronize your bookmarks with your other Opera browsers, and alternate between rendering views. There's also a landscape mode activated by pressing the "#" and "*" keys, just not for BlackBerry phones or a few others. Other limitations exist, as well, most notably that Opera Mini isn't compatible with every carrier and model, so you'd best check the specs first.

Cons Doesn't come with the phone, uses too much memory to run concurrently with other applications. Reply to this review   Was this review helpful?
