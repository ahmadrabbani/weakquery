I turn my back and walk away, away from the pain Screaming loud, drowning out by the sound of the rain Listen up, I've had enough of all this waiting I need you more right now than I ever did You're the minutes, I'm the hours But we'll meet somewhere in between Never now or too soon I say we meet at a quarter to three I just fell in love for the first time [ From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/h/hawthorne-heights-lyrics/somewhere-in-between-lyrics.html ] Watch as I pick myself up off the ground In the dark I'm so far from the spotlight Can you see me now?
