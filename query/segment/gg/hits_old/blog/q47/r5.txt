 Hawthorne Heights to perform at the Blue Moose Tap House - The Daily Iowan

It isn’t something you have to do. So, we just wanted to award [our fans].” Hawthorne Heights will bring its passionate performance to the stage at the Blue Moose Tap House, 211 Iowa Ave., on Friday. The concert will start at 6 p.m., making it an all-ages show, with the Story Changes and the Audition opening. Admission is $11. In addition to seeing the band perform, concertgoers will receive a download of its new album, Skeletons, which was released on June 1. Woodruff cites the current economic crisis as partially responsible for the band’s decision to give away the CD. Woodruff also believes contemporary bands must use unconventional tactics to get their music heard. When his band first started, he said, the members were able to gain recognition through hard work and lots of touring. With the amount of music available for free on the Internet, he feels that those old tactics may not get musicians as far. Talent buyer Doug Roberson believes the reason Hawthorne Heights has sustained its popularity is because of the group’s ability to mix diverse genres and from the intensity in the songs. “[Hawthorne Heights] combines some of the harshness of the hard-core, screamy stuff, with a melodic angle,” Roberson said. “Part of the appeal is also the high energy. There’s a lot of jumping around, which is visually appealing to the audience for sure.” While the music scene has changed during Hawthorne Heights’ career, so has the band’s particular style. Some of the changes were purposeful, and others were the result of circumstances and tragedy. “I think as musicians you always want to get better,” Woodruff said. “… You can’t write the same album over and over even if that’s what some people want … We’ve definitely evolved from album one to album four. Our guitar player and screamer, Casey Calvert, passed away. [Losing him] definitely modified our sound, because we had to learn to live and write without one of our best friends and key components.” On Hawthorne Heights’ recently released album, he said, the band’s evolving sound is apparent. However, he thinks Skeletons contains enough of the group’s classic style to keep its longtime fans satisfied. “I think our old fans … can expect to find a lot of elements that they’ve learned to love over the years,” he said. “… I think [fans] can expect the most honest Hawthorne Heights record yet. Lyrically, I wrote about a lot of the hardest issues I’ve ever faced in my life … everything on there is the truth.” Woodruff also believes sticking bands into different genres is limiting, not just for the bands but for fans who might be hesitant to listen to a group because of preconceptions about the music. “I don’t think a word should turn people on or off of music,” he said. “We never set out to become an emo band. That [label] didn’t exist when we were first playing shows … we kind of miss back in the day when it was either rock, country, or R&B.” The negativity toward the emo label was somewhat bewilders Woodruff. “If you aren’t playing music with emotion and passion, then I just don’t think you should be playing music,” he said.  > Share your thoughts!
