This static contact pulling us apart. Please hang on tight, I'll see you through the night. You have me still because I'm breathing, Although it has slowed down. Please don't cry because I'm leaving. I hope I see you soon. Exchange the sunshine for brown eyes and dark skies, Replace this dull life with you. I know it's tomorrow, She's waiting for something to feel alive. You know me too well, She's sorry and I can tell. Scene missing, fade to black. You're acting all this out again, Just wake me when it's over, When the curtains raise, It's time to move on. Exit now, credits rolling, The girl who stole my heart. The one that got away (one that got away) You know me too well, She's sorry, I can tell. Scene missing, fade to black. You're acting all this out again, again You have me still because I'm breathing, Although it has slowed down. Please don't cry because I'm leaving. I hope I see you soon. You know me too well, She's sorry and I can tell. Scene missing, fade to black.
