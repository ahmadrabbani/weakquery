It's been a pretty trying two years for Hawthorne Heights, to say the very least.
All the drama started back in March 2006, when the release of the band's second album, If Only You Were Lonely, was marred by a rather curious e-mail sent from HH's label, Victory Records, to street teamers, urging them to "relocate" copies of Ne-Yo's In My Own Words album in record stores in order to help Lonely claim the top spot on the Billboard albums chart. Hawthorne originally tried to laugh the whole situation off, saying that they had nothing to do with the e-mail &#8212; despite the fact that it was signed "Your friends, Hawthorne Heights" &#8212; and that it was just the label's way of "rallying the troops."
Of course, by August of that year, they had changed th...</span>

										peta2, an animal rights group that Casey Calvert of Hawthorne Heights spent a lot of time volunteering with, is doing a day of action for animals 12/8 as a memorial tribute.Casey was always full of life. Although shy, he always had a kind word for everyone, made time for his fans, and was dedicated to helping animals in any way he could. He was fun and quirky, and things like his obsession for Tofu Robots and his deep-rooted hatred of onions only endeared him that much more to all of us.When we spoke with Casey over the summer, he told us that he had recently discovered the joys of not only tofu but vegetables too. He also talked about how seeing animals trucked to slaughter made him feel and about the importance of spaying and neutering dogs and cats. Here's a look back at just a few of the many issues that were important to Casey.

										Today is probably the worst day ever.  It's with our deepest regrets that we have to write this.  Casey Calvert passed away in his sleep last night.  We found out this afternoon before sound-check.  We've spent the entire day trying to come to grips with this and figure out as much as possible.  At this time we're not sure what exactly happened.  Just last night he was joking around with everyone before he went to bed.  We can say with absolute certainty that he was not doing anything illegal.  Please, out of respect to Casey and his family, don't contribute or succumb to any gossip you may hear.  We don't want his memory to be tainted in the least. Casey was our best friend.  He was quirky and awesome and there will truly be no others like him!  His loss is unexplainable.  As soon as we know more we will let you know.

You'll also get to introduce us before we go on, hang out, watch our set from the stage and hit us up for advice afterwards (if you want)!Now for some background...The music we listened to while growing up wasn't about writing a catchy single and selling records, it was about having fun, supporting those around you (local bands included), making a positive change in the world, and putting aside differences and uniting under a common love of music (there's more to it than that...but you get the point). We're already doing some other things on this tour to bring the fun and positive message back to music, but we still wanted to do more. We were a local band at one point and we know how hard it is to get the word out about your band. The first step towards becoming a successful band is to build a...</span>

										You may have already heard, but our remaining shows with Red Jumpsuit Apparatus have been cancelled. This was not our decision, and we're totally bummed as we were looking forward to hitting up South Carolina and Florida. We haven't been to many of these places since Warped Tour (and some even before that). These things happen and it sucks. I'm sure RJA's reasons for the cancellations are good, but that still doesn't make it any better for the people that wanted to come out and see a show. Even though it was not our doing, we still feel bad about this and we promise to make it up to our fans in those areas next year!!!The good news is that we have over a month of headlining dates with Escape The Fate, Amber Pacific, The Akas and The Secret Handshake that are very much still happening!

										I love being home more than anyone, but it really feels good to be back on the road again. This year has been relatively low-key (in regards to touring) for us for a change...and not all by choice. I wish I was at liberty to talk more about it right now, but, I'm not. Anyways, we just kicked off our dates with Red Jumpsuit, Amber Pacific and New Years Day, a couple of days ago in Wichita, KS. Its been a while since we played Wichita and I'm glad we got the chance to come back because the show was great. It was great the last time, but it was just a good way to start a tour. We hit up Cain's Ballroom in Tulsa, OK for Halloween and had a blast. On a more somber note, its hard to believe that it was two years ago that our dear friend Beatz passed away. It seems like it was just yesterday. It makes you realize how delicate we really are. You can't take back the past, but you should always remember it and we will always remember Beatz!Today is an off-day so we're in Kansas at some m...</span>

										We just wanted to drop you all a line, and officially announce our winter tour.  Or WINTOUR...We, Hawthorne Heights, would like to welcome Escape The Fate, Amber Pacific, The AKA's, and The Secret Handshake to the stage with us in November and December.If you are thinking..."That's a weird line-up for a tour," you are exactly right.

So at this tour, there is something for everyone...we hope.We always like to help out other bands who we are friends with, or who we generally like to listen to...so that is how this line-up came together.We are planning alot of special things for this tour, so we would appreciate it if everyone could come and have fun, and keep music positive.Be on the lookout for more tour dates and details in the coming days.Thanks for your support of our band, the other bands, and music in general.All dates between 11/23 and 12/21 are with Escape The Fate, Amber Pacific, The Aka's, The Se...</span>

										<span style="font-size: 10pt;">
										Ok, before I post this, I want to say that the "emo" label is probably one of the lamest invention and is just another "genre" that's going to get thrown away for being overly abused, much like alternative, that doesn't mean anything anymore. So when someone stupid starts putting time and effort labelling bands as emo AND wastes his time bashing said bands, I think said person has some mental issues. What kind of label is this anyway... So here's the fun part, Hawthorne Heights' Eron answers to Anti-Emo :Below is my response to the ignorant individual who maintains the Anti-Emo page and who's comment appears below mine for humor:Slow down buddy...way to presume victory...I'd like to point out a few "fatal flaws" in your argument, but first, who the hell makes a childish attack on someone's name when trying to be taken seriously? Way to go...For starters, you're taking my words totally out of context. You asked us why we would add a group that is "Anti-Emo"? The answer is if ...</span>

										So we just wrapped up Warped Tour 2007 less than a week ago and it was a complete blast! Here's what went down the last week of the tour:First we hit Boise. It was a long, long drive to Boise, but once we got there, we had a lot of fun. The weather was perfect, not too hot and not too cold. A definite and much welcome change from Kansas City. The crowd was awesome. Boise is an often over-looked city when it comes to bands touring, which is unfortunate because we've always had awesome shows there.The next day was the "Seattle" show, which as anyone who's ever been there, knows is not actually IN Seattle. This show is located about 2 hours outside of Seattle at a beautiful venue called the Gorge. Imagine a huge amphitheatre located on the side of the Grand Canyon. That's what it looked like. Again the weather was amazing and the scenery makes you never want to leave. The Halo 2 Tournament was supposed to go down this day, but once again, nothing happened and we were told that it w...</span>
