 Big Love: Big Love Season 4 Spoilers

                                   Big Love                                                             Monday, August 24, 2009   Big Love Season 4 Spoilers      Big Love Season 4 - Bubba and I love to watch this polygamist-themed TV show on HBO. I had been waiting for the next season of big love. From what I heard, they had started filming this month for the 4th season. Since I am such a Big Love fanatic, I can't wait to know about the next storyline. So here's some Big Love Season 4 spoilers that I gathered online: -Roman Grant (Harry Dean Stanton) was not able to survive death by pillow suffocation. So, we won't be expecting Roman's evil presence on the next season. -"Nicki (Chloe Sevigny) will always be Nicki. On the next season, she has a returning teenage daughter Cara Lynne to contend with, not to mention ex J.J. -Margie(Ginnifer Goodwin) will be busy with her new jewelry business. I am pretty excited about this! -Sarah (Amanda Seyfried), meanwhile, is said to become "her own woman," while Teenie (Jolean Wejbe) will be like "an entirely different person" - We would also see more of Ana (Branka Katic). Anna has a small stint last season as Bill's 4th wife. - Barb (Jeanne Tripplehorn) will have to deal with being excommunicated when she refused to renounce polygamy, Big Love season 4 would be most likely shown January next year     Posted by  Celine   at   4:06 PM                    Labels:  Big Love Season 4 ,  Big Love Season 4 Spoilers ,  Big Love Spoiler        1 comments:         Pdxby7 said...
