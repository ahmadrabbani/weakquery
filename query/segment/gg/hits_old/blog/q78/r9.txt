On Saturday, I convinced my dad to attend the  First Annual Iowa Sheep and Wool Festival . He agreed to come with me, because he is a fairly accomplished wood worker and wanted to have a looksie at some spinning wheels and spindles (you just can't see those everywhere, ya know). So we headed out in the morning. My expectations were low, but I had in mind that I was going to want to learn to spin in the near future. Here's my rather meager haul:   I purchased the spindle kit and Spin It from  Huacaya Moon out of Bellevue, Iowa. The woman working the booth, Nancy, was extremely kind and gave me a fabulous lesson in how to use the spindle. I have to admit that I was a horrible student. I just can't get the drafting. I'm going to stick with it though, because I am mesmerized by spinning wheels and really want to be able to do it. I think I can. I think I can... I'll update the progress as soon as there is any. I also go the Twisted Sisters book which has fabulous info about knitting socks, because I want to knit an afterthought heel, dyeing roving and yarn, and a bit about basic spinning. Inspiring. But, I also got this:   I love the Mexican grocery store in the downtown of my hometown. They have all sorts of interesting items. I'll be interested to see how this will dye yarn. It does include some dyes that Kool Aid does not, so we shall see.    Posted by  Libby   at   5:22 PM                          0 comment(s). Tell me what you think!:    Post a Comment Talk to me.
