 Northern Michigan Lamb and Wool Festival 2009 Vendors

  Northern Michigan Lamb & Wool Festival 2012 Vendors: The Fantastic Fiber Mini Mall Vendors are open Saturday and Sunday only Celebrate our 13th annual festival with us: September 29 - 30, 2012           Very few spaces are available for 2012.  All empty spaces will be available as of Oct. 1, 2011 and after January 1, 2012, booth fees will increase to $70/space due to rent increases for the facilities.  Please contact Vendor Chair, Jeanie Prentice at         jmprentice@charter.net   There's no denying we have one of the greatest group of fiber vendors of any festival! You can find equipment for all fiber arts - spinning wheels, weaving looms, knitting needles, and much more. Plus more  fiber than you would believe! And high-quality knitting yarns, many handspun or handdyed. Not to mention all sorts of gift items for fiber-lovers and "normal" people as well. If you'd like to become a vendor, see our  Vendor Booth Application and  Vendor Rules .  Photos by Teri Dougherty     You can also download our  flyer to hand out at other festivals or display in your stores.  Vendors, please remember two members of your business are invited to the Vendor Dinner on the Saturday of the festival.
