This commercial features a dog going NUTS!! over Beggin Strips the voice is a really bad copy cat of Gilbert Godfred, it won't shut up! The worst part is theres a segment near the end where he says "I LOVE YOU!!! I LOVE BACON!!!" over and over and over and over and over and over and over again on as seemingly unending loop.   I wish I muted it, too bad the dog is an adorable Golden Retriever, what a waste of an animals talent with a terrible voiceover.       this cat is more intelligent than most ads film at 11            tucuxi   Members Profile   Send Private Message   Find Members Posts   Visit Members Homepage   Add to Buddy List   Commercial Hater  Joined: 17 Apr 2008  Location: MA, USA  Online Status: Offline  Posts: 253    Post Options Post Reply   Quote tucuxi   Report Post       Quote     Reply     Posted: 27 Apr 2008 at 5:43pm  Anything or anyone that sounds like Gilbert Gottfried is like nails on a chalkboard for me. Wasn't that man voted "Un-Sexiest Man Alive" a few years ago??

You're just jealous 'cause the voices only talk to me--and Yutolia!
