The scent alone, and I quote, resembled "the smoky puke of a thousand maniacs." okay, Smart Bacon smelled more like cardboard, but the taste of it recalled Steve's reaction to Beggin' Strips: "I was overcome by the urge to go in the backyard and eat grass until it was all out of me." Really. Ew. Smart Bacon  DOES NOT    taste like bacon. it doesn't even taste healthy, unless you equate health with a solid diet of shredded paper. needless to say, i'm disappointed in the Smart Bacon. i also have over half the package left and know without a doubt that i will eat every last bit of it because it's here and it's safe for human consumption. but, oh, Smart Bacon, i will NOT be happy when i eat you. not at all! damn you Smart Bacon! Damn you!!!    posted by Deepfry @  10:19            7 Comments:       Anonymous said...  Try the Morning Star "bacon strips", much better.  1:03 PM               Extramsg said...  Did you look at the ingredients list? http://www.solaeliving.com/soyproteinproducts/products/smartbacon.jsp I think Doritos and Twinkies are more natural.  7:16 PM               Deepfry said...  ew. i think in the future, i would do best to avoid anything that has an "isolate" as the second ingredient after water.  1:48 AM               cindym said...  Dude, have you tried that yuba crap yet? M Henry has it (in Andersonville). It is billed as a vegan meat, and is akin to eating burnt paper. You should definitely pick some up! Luv, Cindy PS - I just googled "yuba" to make sure I was spelling it right, and the first entry refers to it as a "meat analog". Enough said.  10:11 PM               Anonymous said...  Your scientific survey totally made me pee. And your link to "Steve, Don't Eat It!" might get me and my sister both fired. Or at least yelled at for laughing too hard at work. You, and Steve, are awesome. Laura  1:36 PM               Anonymous said...  Bacon strips bandages   12:16 PM               Suebob said...  It is more like salt strips than bacon strips. And I am a big fanatic vegetarian.  11:20 PM          Post a Comment  << Home
