I don't know when this sale started or ends.....I didn't see it in their AD! I was with my husband and we walked down the pet isle and I saw they have beggin strips (sm bag) on sale 10/10! I told my husband....oh! I think I have a coupon for that at home.  We got home, I opened my binder, and sure enough, its the -$4.00/4 any purina dog treat coupon! (no size limit). I had 4 of these coupons......so...... I got 16 bags for free! (ok, almost free, I paid $1.19 in sales tax) I know its the 4th and if the sale is only for today, sorry, I literally left again, got the treats, came back home and went to make this post!  My dogs LOVE THESE!   ......OK....now that the ad is out, I can edit this, the 3oz beggin strips bag IS on sale all week. There are ALSO -$1.50/2 coupons out there.....making them .25 cents each. Now that I got all my free ones, I am getting another 12 bags at this price.
