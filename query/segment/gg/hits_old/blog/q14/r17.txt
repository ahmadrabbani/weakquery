Active Advisory:  Winter Weather Advisory ( US Severe Weather )         View WunderPhotos® in:  Spokane ,  Washington      Weather Summary     Jessica Parker   Weather Underground midday recap for Wednesday, November 16, 2011.  Active weather continued in between a cold front that moved through the Ohio Valley and a warm front that lifted through the Central Appalachians and the northern Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday. Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and energy from these fronts triggered showers, periods of heavy rainfall, and thunderstorms in the eastern Tennessee and Ohio Valleys through the northern Mid-Atlantic and parts of southern New England. Meanwhile, to the south, additional showers and thunderstorms formed in the Southeast, ahead of a cold front extending through the Southeast and the Southern Plains. There was a slight risk of severe weather development from the Central Gulf Coast through the southeastern Atlantic states. The main concerns with severe weather activity in these areas were damaging wind gusts and a few tornadoes. Thus far, there have been a number of damaging wind gust reports in Alabama. Elsewhere in the East, a few snow flakes and sprinkles fell across the Central Plains.  In the West, a strong frontal system brought rain and heavy mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest. Gale force winds were expected to develop over the marine waters today with locally windy conditions across the land areas. Various Wind Advisories and Warnings, Winter Weather Advisories, and Winter Storm Warnings remained in effect for the region through the afternoon.
