 Silicon Tails: Cheney's hunting accident

 ad     Silicon Tails   ..... A small collection of tales from a Dane in Silicon Valley      Web  this Site     Monday, February 13, 2006  Cheney's hunting accident   T-V comedians target Cheney hunting accident : I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when I heard about Cheney's hunting accident. I ended up laughing: "Said David Letterman on C-B-S's 'Late Show': 'Good news, ladies and gentlemen, we have finally located weapons of mass destruction: It's Dick Cheney.' 'The Tonight Show's' Jay Leno says with word that Cheney had shot a lawyer, 'his popularity is now at 92 percent.' And Jon Stewart on 'The Daily Show' had some advice for parents: 'Do not let your kids go on hunting trips with the vice president. I don't care what kind of lucrative contracts they're trying to land, or energy regulations they're trying to get lifted -- it's just not worth it.'"
