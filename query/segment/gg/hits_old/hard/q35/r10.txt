Grintser       Institution           Russian State University        Country          Russia       I. Summary   The course is addressed to the third through fifth year students majoring in the "Classical Culture" program (Faculty of History and Philology) as well as to the graduates of the Philosophy Department specializing in classical philosophy. It presupposes advanced knowledge of ancient Greek and Latin (at least 2 years of studies) as it would be based on reading and commenting on relevant passages from ancient sources beginning from the Presocratics up to the Hellenistic period. The main goal is to introduce students to the main views of classical philosophers on the origins and functioning of language, to discuss the core ideas expressed and to show different ways they were solved in antiquity. Hence, at the end of the course students should be able not only to interpret the relevant texts serving as course material, but also to get an outline of the system of "linguistic philosophy" in antiquity and (as an addition) to compare it with the methods in which language is analyzed in contemporary Western philosophy. " In this respect, the objective is to show the continuity of Greek philosophic tradition in dealing with linguistic issues Therefore, the course is structured not in chronological order, but tends to be problem-based. The material will be divided into three major sections: "Views on the Origin of Language", "The Idea of Linguistic Signification" and "Structure of Language and Structure of Philosophic Argumentation".  The course is optional and is related to the general obligatory courses on "Classical Philosophy" (students should take the latter before taking the optional course) and "History of the Humanities in the Classical Age". It's a one-semester course and presupposes 24 hours of lectures and 10 hours of practical classes (seminars). The evaluation includes seminar work (30% of the total evaluation), short oral presentations (one 15-minute long talk on a particular problem or text � 30%), and the final paper (3500 words, 10 pages � 40%).  II. Contents    Section 1.  Views on the Origin of Language The idea of language in early literary texts (from Homer up to V century BC). Emergence of language in the philosophy of Presocratics. Nature/convention dichotomy in its application to language: distinctions between origin-oriented and function-oriented interpretations. The beginnings of language in Plato's  Cratylus , the figure of "law-giver" and its possible interpretations. Language in the philosophy of Aristotle: different types of  phone and their distinctions. Origin and the continuous development of language in the philosophy of Epicurus: possible interpretations. Parallelism of the theories of linguistic and cultural development. Development and functioning of language and the analogy/anomaly dichotomy in Stoic and Alexandrian philology. Philosophical dimensions of this opposition. Etymology as a tool for investigating the history of language in Stoic philosophy.  Section 2. The Idea of Linguistic Signification  The emergence of the idea of linguistic signs in Presocratic philosophy (Heraclitus, Parmenides, Democritus). The idea of naming in Plato's  Cratylus . Etymology and signification. Nature/convention opposition and its meaning for the theory of signification. Double notions for linguistic signs by Aristotle ( semeion/symbolon ) and in Stoic philosophy ( semainomenon/lekton ). The idea of propositional truth and falsity. Possible meanings of Stoic  lekton . The idea of signification in Epicurean philosophy (Philodemus). The theory of signification by Augustine and its relation to Stoic theory. Hierarchy of linguistic signification. Linguistic signs and the logical structure of proposition (Aristotle, Stoics, St. Augustine).  Section 3. Structure of Language and Structure of Philosophic Argumentation  The role of linguistic discussions in philosophical texts: internal arguments or mere illustrations? Parmenides and Plato on "not-being": "linguistic" or "ontological" interpretations. Etymological proofs of metaphysical conclusions (Heraclitus, Plato, Aristotle, Stoics). Aristotle's and Stoic categories in their relation to language. Logic and linguistics in Stoic theory.  "Linguistic philosophy" in ancient and modern times. Possible pairs for comparison: Plato-Wittgenstein, Plato-Frege, Aristotle-Tarsky, Aristotle-Carnap. Classical theories of linguistic signs and modern semiotics of Peirce and de Saussure. Basic principles for a correct comparison: parallel problems and differences of approach.  III.
