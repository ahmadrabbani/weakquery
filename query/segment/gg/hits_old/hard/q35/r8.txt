Bibliography  Definition of philosophy Etymology According to its etymology, the word "philosophy" ( philosophia , from  philein , to love, and  sophia , wisdom) means "the love of wisdom". This sense appears again in  sapientia , the word used in the  Middle Ages to designate  philosophy.  In the early stages of  Greek , as of every other, civilization, the boundary line between  philosophy and other departments of  human  knowledge was not sharply defined, and  philosophy was understood to mean "every striving towards  knowledge ". This sense of the word survives in Herodotus (I, xxx) and Thucydides (II, xl). In the ninth century of our era,  Alcuin , employing it in the same sense, says that  philosophy is "naturarum inquisitio, rerum humanarum divinarumque cognitio quantum homini possibile est aestimare"  investigation of  nature , and such  knowledge of things human and Divine as is possible for  man ( P.L. , CI, 952).  In its proper acceptation,  philosophy does not mean the aggregate of the  human  sciences , but "the general  science of things in the  universe by their ultimate determinations and reasons"; or again, "the intimate  knowledge of the  causes and reasons of things", the profound  knowledge of the universal order.  Without here enumerating all the historic definitions of  philosophy, some of the most significant may be given.  Plato calls it "the acquisition of  knowledge ",  ktêsis epistêmês (Euthydemus, 288 d).  Aristotle , mightier than his master at compressing  ideas , writes:  tên onomazomenên sophian peri ta prôta aitia kai tas archas hupolambanousi pantes  "All  men consider  philosophy as concerned with first  causes and principles" ( Metaph. , I, i). These notions were perpetuated in the post-Aristotelean schools ( Stoicism ,  Epicureanism ,  neo-Platonism ), with this difference, that the  Stoics and  Epicureans accentuated the  moral bearing of  philosophy ("Philosophia studium summae virtutis", says Seneca in "Epist.", lxxxix, 7), and the  neo-Platonists its  mystical bearing (see  section V below). The  Fathers of the Church and the first  philosophers of the  Middle Ages seem not to have had a very clear  idea of  philosophy for reasons which we will develop later on ( section IX ), but its conception emerges once more in all its purity among the  Arabic  philosophers at the end of the twelfth century and the masters of  Scholasticism in the thirteenth.  St. Thomas , adopting the  Aristotelean  idea , writes: "Sapientia est scientia quae considerat causas primas et universales causas; sapientia causas primas omnium causarum considerat"  Wisdom [i.e.  philosophy] is the  science which considers first and universal  causes ; wisdom considers the first  causes of all  causes " (In  Metaph. , I, lect. ii).  In general, modern  philosophers may be said to have adopted this way of looking at it.  Descartes regards  philosophy as wisdom: "Philosophiae voce sapientiae studium denotamus"  "By the term  philosophy we denote the pursuit of wisdom" ( Princ. philos. , preface); and he understands by it "cognitio veritatis per primas suas causas"  " knowledge of  truth by its first  causes " (ibid.). For Locke,  philosophy is the  true  knowledge of things; for Berkeley, "the study of wisdom and  truth " ( Princ. ). The many conceptions of  philosophy given by  Kant reduce it to that of a  science of the general principles of  knowledge and of the ultimate objects attainable by  knowledge  "Wissenschaft von den letzten Zwecken der menschlichen Vernunft". For the numerous  German  philosophers who derive their inspiration from his criticism  Fichte,  Hegel , Schelling, Schleiermacher, Schopenhauer, and the rest  it is the general teaching of  science (Wissenschaftslehre). Many contemporary authors regard it as the synthetic theory of the particular  sciences : "Philosophy", says Herbert Spencer, "is completely unified  knowledge " ( First Principles , #37). Ostwald has the same  idea . For Wundt, the object of  philosophy is "the acquisition of such a general conception of the world and of life as will satisfy the exigencies of the  reason and the needs of the heart"  "Gewinnung einer allgemeinen Welt  und Lebensanschauung, welche die Forderungen unserer Vernunft und die Bedurfnisse unseres Gemüths befriedigen soll" ( Einleit. in d. Philos. , 1901, p. 5). This  idea of  philosophy as the ultimate  science of values (Wert lehre) is emphasized by Windelband, Déring, and others.  The list of conceptions and definitions might be indefinitely prolonged. All of them affirm the eminently synthetic character of  philosophy. In the opinion of the present writer, the most exact and comprehensive definition is that of  Aristotle . Face to face with  nature and with himself,  man reflects and endeavours to discover what the world is, and what he is himself. Having made the real the object of studies in detail, each of which constitutes  science (see  section VIII ), he is led to a study of the whole, to inquire into the principles or reasons of the totality of things, a study which supplies the answers to the last  Why 's. The last  Why of all rests upon all that is and all that becomes: it does not apply, as in any one particular  science (e.g. chemistry), to this or that process of becoming, or to this or that being (e.g. the combination of two bodies), but to all  being and all becoming. All  being has within it its constituent principles, which account for its  substance (constitutive  material and  formal  causes ); all becoming, or change, whether superficial or profound, is brought about by an efficient  cause other than its subject; and lastly things and events have their bearings from a finality, or final  cause . The harmony of principles, or  causes , produces the universal order. And thus  philosophy is the profound  knowledge of the universal order, in the sense of having for its object the simplest and most general principles, by means of which all other objects of thought are, in the last resort, explained.  By these principles, says  Aristotle , we  know other things, but other things do not suffice to make us  know these principles ( dia gar tauta kai ek toutôn t'alla gnôrizetai, all' ou tauta dia tôn hupokeimenôn   Metaph. , I). The expression  universal order should be understood in the widest sense.  Man is one part of it: hence the relations of  man with the world of sense and with its  Author belong to the domain of  philosophy. Now  man , on the one hand, is the responsible author of these relations, because he is  free , but he is  obliged by  nature itself to reach an aim, which is his  moral end. On the other hand, he has the power of reflecting upon the  knowledge which he acquires of all things, and this leads him to study the  logical structure of  science . Thus  philosophical  knowledge leads to  philosophical acquaintance with  morality and  logic . And hence we have this more comprehensive definition of  philosophy: "The profound  knowledge of the universal order, of the  duties which that order imposes upon  man , and of the  knowledge which  man acquires from reality"  "La connaissance approfondie de l'ordre universel, des devoirs qui en résultent pour l'homme et de la science que l'homme acquiert de la rémite" (Mercier, "Logique", 1904, p. 23).  The development of these same  ideas under another aspect will be found in  section VIII of this article.   Divisions of philosophy Since the universal order falls within the scope of  philosophy (which studies only its first principles, not its reasons in detail),  philosophy is led to the consideration of all that is: the  world ,  God (or its  cause ), and  man himself (his  nature , origin, operations,  moral end, and  scientific activities).  It would be out of the question to enumerate here all the methods of dividing philosophy that have been given: we confine ourselves to those which have played a part in history and possess the deepest significance.  In Greek philosophy Two historical divisions dominate  Greek philosophy: the  Platonic and the  Aristotelean .  (1)  Plato divides  philosophy into  dialectic ,  physics , and  ethics . This division is not found in  Plato's own writings, and it would be impossible to fit his dialogues into the triple frame, but it corresponds to the spirit of the  Platonic  philosophy. According to Zeller, Xenocrates (314 B.C.) his  disciple , and the leading representative of the Old Academy, was the first to adopt this triadic division, which was destined to go down through the ages ( Grundriss d. Geschichte d. griechischen Philosophie , 144), and  Aristotle follows it in dividing his master's  philosophy.  Dialectic is the  science of objective reality, i.e., of the  Idea ( idea eidos ), so that by  Platonic  dialectic we must understand  metaphysics .  Physics is concerned with the manifestations of the  Idea , or with the Real, in the sensible  universe , to which  Plato attributes no real value independent of that of the  Idea .  Ethics has for its object  human acts .  Plato deals with  logic , but has no system of  logic ; this was a product of  Aristotle's genius.   Plato's classification was taken up by his  school (the Academy), but it was not long in yielding to the influence of  Aristotle's more complete division and according a place to  logic . Following the inspirations of the old Academics, the  Stoics divided  philosophy into  physics (the study of the real),  logic (the study of the structure of  science ) and  morals (the study of  moral  acts ). This classification was perpetuated by the  neo-Platonists , who transmitted it to the  Fathers of the Church , and through them to the  Middle Ages .  (2)  Aristotle ,  Plato's illustrious  disciple , the most didactic, and at the same time the most synthetic,  mind of the  Greek world, drew up a remarkable scheme of the divisions of  philosophy. The  philosophical  sciences are divided into theoretic, practical, and poetic, according as their scope is pure speculative  knowledge , or conduct ( praxis ), or external production ( poiêsis ). Theoretic  philosophy comprises: (a)  physics , or the study of corporeal things which are subject to change ( achôrista men all' ouk akinêta ) (b) mathematics, or the study of  extension , i.e., of a corporeal property not subject to change and considered, by  abstraction , apart from  matter ( akinêta men ou chôrista d'isôs, all' hôs en hulê ); (c)  metaphysics , called  theology , or first  philosophy, i.e. the study of being in its unchangeable and (whether naturally or by  abstraction ) incorporeal determinations ( chôrista kau akinêt ). Practical  philosophy comprises  ethics ,  economics , and politics, the second of these three often merging into the last. Poetic  philosophy is concerned in general with the external works conceived by  human  intelligence . To these may conveniently be added  logic , the vestibule of  philosophy, which  Aristotle studied at length, and of which he may be called the creator.  To  metaphysics  Aristotle rightly accords the place of  honour in the grouping of  philosophical studies. He calls it "first  philosophy". His classification was taken up by the Peripatetic School and was famous throughout antiquity; it was eclipsed by the  Platonic classification during the  Alexandrine period, but it reappeared during the  Middle Ages .  In the Middle Ages Though the division of  philosophy into its branches is not uniform in the first period of the  Middle Ages in the West, i.e. down to the end of the twelfth century, the classifications of this period are mostly akin to the  Platonic division into  logic ,  ethics , and  physics .  Aristotle's classification of the theoretic  sciences , though made  known by  Boethius , exerted no influence for the reason that in the early  Middle Ages the West  knew nothing of  Aristotle except his works on  logic and some fragments of his speculative  philosophy (see  section V below). It should be added here that  philosophy, reduced at first to  dialectic , or  logic , and placed as such in the  Trivium , was not long in setting itself above the  liberal arts .  The  Arab  philosophers of the twelfth century ( Avicenna ,  Averroes ) accepted the  Aristotelean classification, and when their works  particularly their translations of  Aristotle's great original treatises  penetrated into the West, the  Aristotelean division definitively took its place there. Its coming is heralded by Gundissalinus (see  section XII ), one of the  Toletan translators of  Aristotle , and author of a treatise, "De divisione philosophiae", which was imitated by Michael Scott and  Robert Kilwardby .  St. Thomas did no more than adopt it and give it a precise  scientific form. Later on we shall see that, conformably with the  medieval notion of  sapientia , to each part of  philosophy corresponds the preliminary study of a group of special  sciences . The general scheme of the division of  philosophy in the thirteenth century, with  St. Thomas's commentary on it, is as follows:  There are as many parts of  philosophy as there are distinct domains in the order submitted to the  philosopher's reflection. Now there is an order which the  intelligence does not form but only considers; such is the order realized in  nature . Another order, the practical, is formed either by the  acts of our  intelligence or by the  acts of our  will , or by the application of those acts to external things in the arts: e.g., the division of practical  philosophy into  logic ,  moral  philosophy, and  æsthetics , or the  philosophy of the arts ( "Ad philosophiam naturalem pertinet considerare ordinem rerum quem ratio humana considerat sed non facit; ita quod sub naturali philosophia comprehendamus et metaphysicam. Ordo autem quem ratio considerando facit in proprio actu, pertinet ad rationalem philosophiam, cujus est considerare ordinem partium orationis ad invicem et ordinem principiorum ad invicem et ad conclusiones. Ordo autem actionum voluntariarum pertinet ad considerationem moralis philosophiae. Ordo autem quem ratio considerando facit in rebus exterioribus per rationem humanam pertinet ad artes mechanicas." ) To natural  philosophy pertains the consideration of the order of things which  human  reason considers but does not create  just as we include  metaphysics also under natural  philosophy. But the order which  reason creates of its own act by consideration pertains to  rational  philosophy, the office of which is to consider the order of the parts of speech with reference to one another and the order of the principles with reference to one another and to the conclusions. The order of  voluntary actions pertains to the consideration of  moral  philosophy, while the order which the  reason creates in external things through the  human  reason pertains to the mechanical arts.  In "X Ethic. ad Nic.", I, lect. i.    The  philosophy of  nature , or speculative  philosophy, is divided into  metaphysics , mathematics, and  physics , according to the three stages traversed by the  intelligence in its effort to attain a synthetic comprehension of the universal order, by abstracting from movement ( physics ), intelligible  quantity (mathematics), being ( metaphysics ) ( In lib. Boeth. de Trinitate , Q. v., a. 1). In this classification it is to be noted that,  man being one element of the world of sense,  psychology ranks as a part of  physics .  In modern philosophy The  Scholastic classification may be said, generally speaking, to have lasted, with some exceptions, until the seventeenth century. Beginning with  Descartes , we find a multitude of classifications arising, differing in the principles which inspire them.  Kant , for instance, distinguishes  metaphysics ,  moral  philosophy,  religion , and anthropology. The most widely accepted scheme, that which still governs the division of the branches of  philosophy in teaching, is due to Wolff (1679-1755), a  disciple of  Leibniz , who has been called the educator of  Germany in the eighteenth century. This scheme is as follows:  Logic.  Speculative  Philosophy.   Ontology , or General  Metaphysics .  Special  Metaphysics .   Theodicy (the study of  God ).   Cosmology (the study of the  World ).  Psychology (the study of  Man ).    Practical  Philosophy.   Ethics  Politics   Economics     Wolff broke the ties binding the particular  sciences to  philosophy, and placed them by themselves; in his view  philosophy must remain purely  rational . It is easy to see that the members of Wolff's scheme are found in the  Aristotelean classification, wherein  theodicy is a chapter of  metaphysics and  psychology a chapter of  physics . It may even be said that the  Greek classification is better than Wolff's in regard to speculative  philosophy, where the ancients were guided by the formal object of the study  i.e. by the degree of  abstraction to which the whole  universe is subjected, while the moderns always look at the material object  i.e., the three categories of being, which it is possible to study,  God , the world of sense, and  man .  In contemporary philosophy The impulse received by  philosophy during the last half-century gave rise to new  philosophical  sciences , in the sense that various branches have been detached from the main stems. In  psychology this phenomenon has been remarkable: criteriology, or  epistemology (the study of the  certitude of  knowledge ) has developed into a special study. Other branches which have formed themselves into new  psychological sciences are: physiological  psychology or the study of the physiological concomitant of psychic activities; didactics, or the  science of teaching; pedagogy, or the  science of  education ; collective  psychology and the  psychology of people (Volkerpsychologie), studying the psychic phenomena observable in human groups as such, and in the different  races . An important section of  logic (called also noetic, or canonic) is tending to sever itself from the main body, viz., methodology, which studies the special  logical formation of various  sciences . On  moral  philosophy, in the wide sense, have been grafted the  philosophy of  law , the  philosophy of  society , or social  philosophy (which is much the same as  sociology ), and the  philosophies of  religion and of history.  The principal systematic solutions From what has been said above it is evident that  philosophy is beset by a great number of questions. It would not be possible here to enumerate all those questions, much less to detail the divers solutions which have been given to them. The solution of a  philosophic question is called a  philosophic doctrine or theory. A  philosophic system (from  sunistêmi , put together) is a complete and organized group of solutions. It is not an incoherent assemblage or an encyclopedic amalgamation of such solutions; it is dominated by an organic unity. Only those  philosophic systems which are constructed conformably with the exigencies of organic unity are really powerful: such are the systems of the Upanishads, of  Aristotle , of  neo-Platonism , of  Scholasticism , of  Leibniz ,  Kant and Hume. So that one or several theories do not constitute a system; but some theories, i.e. answers to a  philosophic question, are important enough to determine the solution of other important problems of a system. The scope of this section is to indicate some of these theories.  Monism, or Pantheism, and Pluralism, Individualism, or Theism Are there many beings distinct in their reality, with one Supreme Being,  God at the summit of the hierarchy; or is there but one reality ( monas , hence  monism ), one All-God ( pan-theos ) of whom each  individual is but a member or fragment (Substantialistic  Pantheism ), or else a force, or energy (Dynamic  Pantheism )? Here we have an important question of  metaphysics the solution of which reacts upon all other domains of  philosophy. The system of  Aristotle , of the  Scholastics , and of  Leibniz are Pluralistic and Theistic; the  Indian ,  neo-Platonic , and  Hegelian are  Monistic .  Monism is a fascinating explanation of the real, but it only postpones the difficulties which it  imagines itself to be solving (e.g. the difficulty of the interaction of things), to say nothing of the objection, from the  human point of view, that it runs counter to our most deep-rooted sentiments.  Objectivism and Subjectivism Does being, whether one or many, possess its own  life , independent of our  mind , so that to be  known by us is only  accident to being, as in the objective system of  metaphysics (e.g.  Aristotle , the  Scholastics ,  Spinoza )? Or is being no other reality than the  mental and subjective presence which it acquires in our representation of it as in the Subjective system (e.g. Hume)? It is in this sense that the "Revue de métaphysique et de morale" (see bibliography) uses the term  metaphysics in its title. Subjectivism cannot explain the passivity of our  mental representations, which we do not draw out of ourselves, and which therefore  oblige us to infer the reality of a non-ego.  Substantialism and Phenomenism Is all reality a flux of phenomena (Heraclitus, Berkeley, Hume, Taine), or does the manifestation appear upon a basis, or  substance , which manifests itself, and does the phenomenon demand a noumenon (the  Scholastics )? Without an underlying  substance , which we only  know through the medium of the phenomenon, certain realities, as walking, talking, are inexplicable, and such facts as  memory become absurd.  Mechanism and Dynamism (Pure and Modified) Natural bodies are considered by some to be aggregations of homogeneous particles of  matter ( atoms ) receiving a movement which is extrinsic to them, so that these bodies differ only in the number and arrangement of their  atoms (the  Atomism , or  Mechanism , of Democritus,  Descartes , and Hobbes). Others reduce them to specific, unextended, immaterial forces, of which  extension is only the superficial manifestation (Leibniz). Between the two is Modified  Dynamism ( Aristotle ), which distinguishes in bodies an  immanent specific principle ( form ) and an indeterminate element ( matter ) which is the source of limitation and  extension . This theory accounts for the specific characters of the entities in question as well as for the reality of their  extension in  space .  Materialism, Agnosticism, and Spiritualism That everything real is material, that whatever might be immaterial would be unreal, such is the cardinal  doctrine of  Materialism (the  Stoics , Hobbes, De Lamettrie). Contemporary  Materialism is less outspoken: it is inspired by a  Positivist ideology (see  section VI ), and asserts that, if anything supra-material exists, it is unknowable ( Agnosticism , from  a and  gnôsis ,  knowledge ; Spencer, Huxley).  Spiritualism teaches that incorporeal, or immaterial, beings exist or that they are possible ( Plato ,  Aristotle ,  St. Augustine , the  Scholastics ,  Descartes ,  Leibniz ). Some have even asserted that only  spirits exist: Berkeley, Fichte, and  Hegel are exaggerated  Spiritualists . The  truth is that there are bodies and  spirits ; among the latter we are acquainted (though less well than with bodies) with the  nature of our  soul , which is revealed by the  nature of our immaterial  acts , and with the  nature of God , the  infinite intelligence, whose  existence is demonstrated by the very  existence of finite things. Side by side with these solutions relating to the problems of the real, there is another group of solutions, not less influential in the orientation of a system, and relating to psychical problems or those of the  human ego.  Sensualism and Rationalism, or Spiritualism These are the opposite poles of the ideogenetic question, the question of the origin of our  knowledge . For Sensualism the only source of  human  knowledge is sensation: everything reduces to transformed sensations. This theory, long ago put forward in  Greek  philosophy ( Stoicism ,  Epicureanism ), was developed to the full by the  English Sensualists (Locke, Berkeley, Hume) and the  English Associationists (Brown, Hartley, Priestley); its modern form is  Positivism (John Stuart Mill, Huxley, Spencer, Comte, Taine,  Littré etc.). Were this theory  true , it would follow that we can  know only what falls under our senses, and therefore cannot pronounce upon the  existence or non-existence, the reality or unreality, of the super-sensible.  Positivism is more  logical than  Materialism . In the  New World , the term  Agnosticism has been very happily employed to indicate this attitude of reserve towards the super-sensible.  Rationalism (from  ratio ,  reason ), or  Spiritualism , establishes the  existence in us of concepts higher than sensations, i.e. of abstract and general concepts ( Plato ,  Aristotle ,  St. Augustine , the  Scholastics ,  Descartes ,  Leibniz ,  Kant ,  Cousin etc.). Ideologic  Spiritualism has won the adherence of  humanity's greatest thinkers. Upon the spirituality, or immateriality, of our higher  mental operations is based the  proof of the spirituality of the principle from which they proceed and, hence, of the  immortality of the  soul .  Scepticism, Dogmatism, and Criticism So many answers have been given to the question whether  man can attain  truth , and what is the foundation of  certitude , that we will not attempt to enumerate them all.  Scepticism declares  reason incapable of arriving at the  truth , and holds  certitude to be a purely subjective affair (Sextus Empiricus, Ænesidemus). Dogmatism asserts that  man can attain to  truth , and that, in measure to be further determined, our cognitions are  certain . The motive of  certitude is, for the  Traditionalists , a  Divine revelation , for the  Scotch School (Reid) it is an inclination of  nature to affirm the principles of  common sense ; it is an irrational, but social,  necessity of admitting certain principles for practical dogmatism (Balfour in his "Foundations of Belief" speaks of "non-rational impulse", while Mallock holds that " certitude is found to be the child, not of  reason but of  custom " and  Brunetière writes about "the bankruptcy of  science and the need of  belief "); it is an affective sentiment, a  necessity of wishing that certain things may be verities ( Voluntarism ;  Kant's Moral Dogmatism), or the fact of living certain verities (contemporary  Pragmatism and  Humanism , William James, Schiller). But for others  and this is the theory which we accept  the motive of  certitude is the very evidence of the connection which appears between the predicate and the subject of a proposition, an evidence which the  mind perceives, but which it does not create (Moderate Dogmatism). Lastly for Criticism, which is the  Kantian solution of the problem of  knowledge , evidence is created by the  mind by means of the structural functions with which every  human  intellect is furnished (the  categories of the understanding). In conformity with these functions we connect the impressions of the senses and construct the world.  Knowledge , therefore, is valid only for the world as represented to the  mind .  Kantian Criticism ends in excessive  Idealism , which is also called Subjectivism or  Phenomenalism , and according to which the  mind draws all its representations out of itself, both the sensory impressions and the  categories which connect them: the world becomes a  mental poem, the object is created by the subject as representation (Fichte, Schelling,  Hegel ).  Nominalism, Realism, and Conceptualism Nominalism, Realism, and Conceptualism are various answers to the question of the real objectivity of our predications, or of the relation of fidelity existing between our general representations and the external world.  Determinism and Indeterminism Has every phenomenon or fact its adequate  cause in an antecedent phenomenon or fact (Cosmic  Determinism )? And, in respect to acts of the  will , are they likewise determined in all their constituent elements (Moral  Determinism ,  Stoicism ,  Spinoza )? If so, then  liberty disappears, and with it human responsibility,  merit and demerit. Or, on the contrary, is there a category of volitions which are not necessitated, and which depend upon the discretionary power of the  will to  act or not to  act and in acting to follow freely chosen direction? Does  liberty exist? Most  Spiritualists of all schools have adopted a libertarian  philosophy, holding that  liberty alone gives the  moral life an acceptable meaning; by various arguments they have confirmed the testimony of  conscience and the data of common  consent . In physical  nature  causation and  determinism rule; in the  moral life,  liberty . Others, by no means numerous, have even pretended to discover cases of indeterminism in physical  nature (the so-called Contingentist theories, e.g. Boutroux).  Utilitarianism and the morality of obligation What constitutes the foundation of  morality in our actions? Pleasure or utility say some, personal or egoistic pleasure ( Egoism  Hobbes,  Bentham , and "the arithmetic of pleasure"); or again, in the pleasure and utility of all ( Altruism  John Stuart Mill). Others hold that  morality consists in the performance of  duty for  duty's sake, the observance of  law because it is  law , independently of personal profit (the Formalism of the  Stoics and of  Kant ). According to another  doctrine , which in our opinion is more correct, utility, or personal advantage, is not incompatible with  duty , but the source of the  obligation to act is in the last  analysis , as the very exigencies of our  nature tell us, the ordinance of  God .  Philosophical methods Method ( meth' hodos ) means a path taken to reach some objective point. By  philosophical method is understood the path leading to  philosophy, which, again, may mean either the process employed in the construction of a  philosophy (constructive method, method of invention), or the way of teaching  philosophy (method of teaching, didactic method). We will deal here with the former of these two senses; the latter will be treated in  section XI . Three methods can be, and have been, applied to the construction of  philosophy.  Experimental (Empiric, or Analytic) method The method of all  Empiric  philosophers is to observe facts, accumulate them, and coordinate them. Pushed to its ultimate consequences, the  empirical method refuses to rise beyond observed and observable fact; it abstains from investigating anything that is absolute. It is found among the  Materialists , ancient and modern, and is most unreservedly applied in contemporary  Positivism . Comte opposes the "positive mode of thinking", based solely upon observation, to the  theological and  metaphysical modes. For Mill, Huxley, Bain, Spencer, there is not one  philosophical proposition but is the product, pure and simple, of experience: what we take for a general  idea is an aggregate of sensations; a judgment is the union of two sensations; a syllogism, the passage from particular to particular (Mill, "A System of Logic, Rational and Inductive", ed. Lubbock, 1892; Bain, "Logic", New York, 1874). Mathematical propositions, fundamental axioms such as a = a, the principle of contradiction, the principle of  causality are only "generalizations from facts of experience" (Mill, op. cit., vii, #5). According to this author, what we  believe to be superior to experience in the enunciation of  scientific laws is derived from our subjective incapacity to conceive its contradictory; according to Spencer, this inconceivability of the negation is developed by  heredity .  Applied in an exaggerated and exclusive fashion, the experimental method mutilates facts, since it is powerless to ascend to the  causes and the  laws which govern facts. It suppresses the character of objective  necessity which is inherent in  scientific judgments, and reduces them to collective formulae of facts observed in the past. It forbids our asserting, e.g., that the  men who will be born after us will be subject to death, seeing that all  certitude rests on experience, and that by mere observation we cannot reach the unchangeable  nature of things. The  empirical method, left to its own resources, checks the upward movement of the  mind towards the  causes or object of the phenomena which confront it.  Deductive, or Synthetic  a Priori , method At the opposite pole to the preceding, the  deductive method starts from very general principles, from higher  causes , to descend ( Latin  deducere , to lead down) to more and more complex relations and to facts. The dream of the Deductionist is to take as the point of departure an  intuition of the  Absolute , of the Supreme Reality  for the Theists,  God ; for the  Monists , the Universal Being  and to draw from this  intuition the synthetic  knowledge of all that depends upon it in the  universe , in conformity with the  metaphysical scale of the real.  Plato is the father of  deductive  philosophy: he starts from the world of  Ideas , and from the  Idea of the  Sovereign Good , and he would  know the reality of the world of sense only in the  Ideas of which it is the reflection.  St. Augustine , too, finds his satisfaction in studying the  universe , and the least of the beings which compose it, only in a synthetic  contemplation of  God , the exemplary, creative, and final  cause of all things. So, too, the  Middle Ages attached great importance to the  deductive method . "I propose", writes  Boethius , "to build  science by means of concepts and maxims, as is done in mathematics."  Anselm of Canterbury draws from the  idea of  God , not only the  proof of the real  existence of an  infinite being, but also a group of theorems on  His attributes and  His relations with the world . Two centuries before  Anselm ,  Scotus  Eriugena , the father of anti-Scholasticism, is the completest type of the Deductionist: his  metaphysics is one long description of the Divine Odyssey, inspired by the  neo-Platonic ,  monistic conception of the descent of the One in its successive generations. And, on the very threshold of the thirteenth century,  Alain de Lille would apply to  philosophy a mathematical methodology. In the thirteenth century  Raymond Lully  believed that he had found the secret of "the Great Art" ( ars magna ), a sort of syllogism-machine, built of general tabulations of  ideas , the combination of which would give the solution of any question whatsoever.  Descartes ,  Spinoza , and  Leibniz are Deductionists: they would construct  philosophy after the manner of geometry ( more geometrico ), linking the most special and complicated theorems to some very simple axioms. The same tendency appears among the  Ontologists and the post-Kantian  Pantheists in  Germany (Fichte, Schelling,  Hegel ), who base their  philosophy upon an  intuition of the  Absolute Being .  The  deductive  philosophers generally profess to disdain the  sciences of observation. Their great fault is the compromising of fact, bending it to a preconceived explanation or theory assumed  a priori , whereas the observation of the fact ought to precede the assignment of its  cause or of its adequate reason. This defect in the  deductive method appears glaringly in a youthful work of  Leibniz's , "Specimen demonstrationum politicarum pro rege Polonorum eligendo", published anonymously in 1669, where he demonstrates by geometrical methods ( more geometrico ), in sixty propositions, that the Count Palatine of Neuburg ought to be  elected to the  Polish Throne.  Analytico-Synthetic method This combination of  analysis and synthesis, of observation and  deduction , is the only method appropriate to  philosophy. Indeed, since it undertakes to furnish a general explanation of the universal order (see  section I ),  philosophy ought to begin with complex effects, facts  known by observation, before attempting to include them in one comprehensive explanation of the  universe . This is manifest in  psychology , where we begin with a careful examination of activities, notably of the phenomena of sense, of  intelligence , and of  appetite ; in  cosmology , where we observe the series of changes, superficial and profound, of bodies; in  moral  philosophy, which sets out from the observation of  moral facts; in  theodicy , where we interrogate  religious  beliefs and feelings; even in  metaphysics , the starting-point of which is really  existing being .  But observation and  analysis once completed, the work of synthesis begins. We must pass onward to a synthetic  psychology that shall enable us to comprehend the destinies of  man's vital principle; to a  cosmology that shall explain the constitution of bodies, their changes, and the stability of the  laws which govern them; to a synthetic  moral  philosophy establishing the end of  man and the ultimate ground of  duty ; to a  theodicy and  deductive  metaphysics that shall examine the  attributes of God and the fundamental conceptions of all being.  As a whole and in each of its divisions,  philosophy applies the analytic-synthetic method. Its ideal would be to give an account of the  universe and of  man by a synthetic  knowledge of  God , upon whom all reality depends. This panoramic view  the eagle's view of things  has allured all the great geniuses.  St. Thomas expresses himself admirably on this synthetic  knowledge of the  universe and its first  cause . The analytico-synthetic process is the method, not only of  philosophy, but of every  science , for it is the  natural law of thought, the proper function of which is unified and orderly  knowledge . "Sapientis est ordinare."  Aristotle ,  St. Thomas ,  Pascal , Newton,  Pasteur , thus understood the method of the  sciences . Men like Helmholtz and Wundt adopted synthetic views after doing analytical work. Even the  Positivists are  metaphysicians , though they do not  know it or wish it. Does not Herbert Spencer call his  philosophy synthetic? and does he not, by reasoning, pass beyond that domain of the "observable" within which he professes to confine himself?  The great historical currents Among the many peoples who have covered the globe  philosophic culture appears in two groups: the  Semitic and the  Indo - European , to which may be added the  Egyptians and the  Chinese . In the  Semitic group ( Arabs ,  Babylonians ,  Assyrians , Aramaeans, Chaldeans) the  Arabs are the most important; nevertheless, their part becomes insignificant when compared with the  intellectual life of the  Indo - Europeans . Among the latter,  philosophic life appears successively in various ethnic divisions, and the succession forms the great periods into which the history of  philosophy is divided; first, among the people of  India (since 1500 B.C.); then among the  Greeks and the Romans (sixth century B.C. to sixth century of our era); again, much later, among the peoples of Central and Northern  Europe .  Indian philosophy The  philosophy of  India is recorded principally in the sacred books of the  Veda , for it has always been closely united with  religion . Its numerous poetic and  religious productions carry within themselves a  chronology which enables us to assign them to three periods.  (1) The Period of the Hymns of the Rig Veda (1500-1000 B.C.)   This is the most ancient monument of  Indo - Germanic civilization; in it may be seen the progressive appearance of the fundamental theory that a single Being exists under a thousand  forms in the multiplied phenomena of the  universe ( Monism ).  (2) The Period of the Brahmans (1000-500 B.C.)   This is the age of  Brahminical civilization. The theory of the one Being remains, but little by little the concrete and  anthropomorphic  ideas of the one Being are replaced by the doctrine that the basis of all things is in oneself ( âtman ).  Psychological  Monism appears in its entirety in the Upanishads: the absolute and adequate identity of the Ego  which is the constitutive basis of our  individuality ( âtman )  and of all things, with Brahman, the  eternal being exalted above  time ,  space ,  number , and change, the generating principle of all things in which all things are finally reabsorbed  such the fundamental theme to be found in the Upanishad under a thousand variations of  form . To arrive at the âtman, we must not stop at empirical reality which is multiple and cognizable; we must pierce this husk, penetrate to the unknowable and ineffable superessence, and identify ourselves with it in an unconscious unity.  (3) The Post-Vedic or Sanskrit, Period (since 500 B.C.)   From the germs of theories contained in the Upanishad a series of systems spring up, orthodox or heterodox. Of the orthodox systems, Vedanta is the most interesting; in it we find the principles of the Upanishads developed in an integral  philosophy which comprise  metaphysics ,  cosmology ,  psychology , and  ethics (transmigration,  metempsychosis ). Among the systems not in harmony with the Vedic dogmas, the most celebrated is  Buddhism , a kind of  Pessimism which teaches liberation from pain in a state of unconscious repose, or an extinction of  personality ( Nirvâna ).  Buddhism spread in  China , where it lives side by side with the doctrines of  Lao Tse and that of  Confucius . It is evident that even the systems which are not in harmony with the  Veda are permeated with  religious  ideas .  Greek philosophy This  philosophy, which occupied six centuries before, and six after,  Christ , may be divided into four periods, corresponding with the succession of the principal lines of research (1) From Thales of Miletus to  Socrates (seventh to fifth centuries B.C.  preoccupied with  cosmology ) (2)  Socrates ,  Plato , and  Aristotle (fifth to fourth centuries B.C.   psychology ); (3) From the death of  Aristotle to the rise of  neo-Platonism (end of the fourth century B.C. to third century after  Christ   moral  philosophy); (4)  neo-Platonic School (from the third century after  Christ , or, including the systems of the forerunners of  neo-Platonism , from the first century after  Christ , to the end of  Greek  philosophy in the seventh century   mysticism ).  (1) The Pre-Socratic Period   The pre-Socratic  philosophers either seek for the stable basis of things  which is water, for Thales of Miletus; air, for Anaximenes of Miletus; air  endowed with  intelligence , for Diogenes of Apollonia; number, for  Pythagoras (sixth century B.C.); abstract and immovable being, for the Eleatics  or they study that which changes: while Parmenides and the Eleatics assert that everything is, and nothing changes or becomes. Heraclitus (about 535-475) holds that everything becomes, and nothing is unchangeable. Democritus (fifth century) reduces all beings to groups of  atoms in motion, and this movement, according to Anaxagoras, has for its  cause an intelligent being.  (2) The Period of Apogee: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle.   When the  Sophists (Protagoras, Gorgias) had demonstrated the insufficiency of these  cosmologies ,  Socrates (470-399) brought  philosophical investigation to bear on  man himself, studying  man chiefly from the  moral point of view. From the presence in us of abstract  ideas  Plato (427-347)  deduced the  existence of a world of supersensible realities or  ideas , of which the visible world is but a pale reflection. These  ideas , which the  soul in an earlier  life contemplated, are now, because of its union with the body, but faintly perceived.  Aristotle (384-322), on the contrary, shows that the real dwells in the objects of sense. The theory of  act and potentiality , of  form and  matter , is a new solution of the relations between the permanent and the changing. His  psychology , founded upon the principle of the unity of  man and the  substantial union of  soul and body, is a creation of genius. And as much may be said of his  logic .  (3) The Moral Period   After  Aristotle (end of the fourth Century B.C.) four  schools are in evidence:  Stoic ,  Epicurean ,  Platonic , and  Aristotelean . The  Stoics (Zeno of Citium, Cleanthes, Chrysippus), like the  Epicureans , make speculation subordinate to the quest of  happiness , and the two  schools , in spite of their divergencies, both consider  happiness to be  ataraxia or absence of sorrow and preoccupation. The teachings of both on  nature (Dynamistic  Monism with the  Stoics , and Pluralistic  Mechanism with the  Epicureans ) are only a prologue to their  moral  philosophy. After the latter half of the second century B.C. we perceive reciprocal infiltrations between the various  schools . This issues in  Eclecticism . Seneca (first century B.C.) and Cicero (106-43 B.C.) are attached to  Eclecticism with a  Stoic basis; two great commentators of  Aristotle , Andronicus of Rhodes (first century B.C.) and Alexander of Aphrodisia about 200), affect a Peripatetic  Eclecticism . Parallel with  Eclecticism runs a current of  Scepticism (Ænesidemus, end of first century B.C., and Sextus Empiricus, second century A.D.).  (4) The Mystical Period   In the first century B.C.  Alexandria had become the capital of  Greek  intellectual life.  Mystical and theurgic tendencies, born of a longing for the ideal and the beyond, began to appear in a current of  Greek  philosophy which originated in a restoration of  Pythagorism and its alliance with  Platonism (Plutarch of Chieronea, first century B.C.; Apuleius of Madaura; Numenius, about 160 and others), and still more in the Graeco-Judaic  philosophy of  Philo the Jew (30 B.C. to A.D. 50). But the dominance of these tendencies is more apparent in  neo-Platonism . The most brilliant thinker of the  neo-Platonic series is Plotinus (A.D. 20-70). In his "Enneads" he traces the paths which lead the  soul to the One, and establishes, in keeping with his  mysticism , an  emanationist  metaphysical system. Porphyry of Tyre (232-304), a  disciple of Plotinus, popularizes his teaching, emphasizes its  religious bearing, and makes  Aristotle's "Organon" the introduction to  neo-Platonic  philosophy. Later on,  neo-Platonism , emphasizing its  religious features, placed itself, with Jamblichus, at the service of the  pagan pantheon which growing  Christianity was ruining on all sides, or again, as with Themistius at  Constantinople (fourth century),  Proclus and  Simplicius at  Athens (fifth century), and  Ammonius at  Alexandria , it took an Encyclopedic turn. With  Ammonius and John Philoponus (sixth century) the  neo-Platonic School of  Alexandria developed in the direction of  Christianity .  Patristic philosophy In the closing years of the second century and, still more, in the third century, the  philosophy of the  Fathers of the Church was developed. It was born in a civilization dominated by  Greek  ideas , chiefly  neo-Platonic , and on this side its mode of thought is still the ancient. Still, if some, like  St. Augustine , attach the greatest value to the  neo-Platonic teachings, it must not be forgotten that the  Monist or  Pantheistic and  Emanationist  ideas , which have been accentuated by the successors of Plotinus, are carefully replaced by the theory of  creation and the  substantial distinction of beings; in this respect a new spirit animates  Patristic  philosophy. It was developed, too, as an auxiliary of the  dogmatic system which the  Fathers were to establish. In the third century the great representatives of the Christian School of  Alexandria are  Clement of Alexandria and  Origen . After them  Gregory of Nyssa ,  Gregory of Nazianzus ,  St. Ambrose , and, above all,  St. Augustine (354-430) appear.  St. Augustine gathers up the  intellectual treasures of the ancient world, and is one of the principal intermediaries for their transmission to the modern world. In its definitive form  Augustinism is a fusion of intellectualism and  mysticism , with a study of  God as the centre of interest. In the fifth century,  pseudo-Dionysius perpetuates many a  neo-Platonic  doctrine adapted to  Christianity , and his writings exercise a powerful influence in the  Middle Ages .  Medieval philosophy The  philosophy of the  Middle Ages developed simultaneously in the West, at  Byzantium , and in divers Eastern centres; but the Western  philosophy is the most important. It built itself up with great effort on the ruins of barbarism: until the twelfth century, nothing was  known of  Aristotle , except some treatises on  logic , or of  Plato , except a few dialogues. Gradually, problems arose, and, foremost, in importance, the question of  universals in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries (see  NOMINALISM ).  St. Anselm (1033-1109) made a first attempt at systematizing  Scholastic philosophy , and developed a  theodicy . But as early as the ninth century an anti-Scholastic  philosophy had arisen with  Eriugena who revived the  neo-Platonic  Monism .  In the twelfth century  Scholasticism formulated new anti-Realist doctrines with  Adelard of Bath , Gauthier de Mortagne, and, above all,  Abelard and  Gilbert de la Porrée , whilst extreme  Realism took shape in the  schools of  Chartres .  John of Salisbury and  Alain de Lille , in the twelfth century, are the co-ordinating minds that indicate the maturity of  Scholastic thought. The latter of these waged a campaign against the  Pantheism of  David of Dinant and the  Epicureanism of the  Albigenses  the two most important forms of anti-Scholastic  philosophy. At  Byzantium ,  Greek  philosophy held its ground throughout the  Middle Ages , and kept apart from the movement of Western  ideas . The same is  true of the  Syrians and  Arabs .  But at the end of the twelfth century the  Arabic and  Byzantine movement entered into relation with Western thought, and effected, to the profit of the latter, the brilliant  philosophical revival of the thirteenth century. This was due, in the first place, to the creation of the  University of Paris ; next, to the foundation of the  Dominican and  Franciscan orders; lastly, to the introduction of Arabic and  Latin translations of  Aristotle and the ancient authors. At the same period the works of  Avicenna and  Averroes became known at  Paris . A pleiad of brilliant names fills the thirteenth century   Alexander of Hales ,  St. Bonaventure , Bl.  Albertus Magnus ,  St. Thomas Aquinas ,  Godfrey of Fontaines ,  Henry of Ghent ,  Giles of Rome , and  Duns Scotus  bring  Scholastic synthesis to perfection. They all wage  war on Latin  Averroism and anti-Scholasticism, defended in the  schools of Paris by  Siger of Brabant .  Roger Bacon ,  Lully , and a group of  neo-Platonists occupy a place apart in this century, which is completely filled by remarkable figures.  In the fourteenth century  Scholastic philosophy betrays the first symptoms of decadence. In place of individualities we have schools, the chief being the  Thomist , the  Scotist , and the Terminist School of  William of Occam , which soon attracted numerous partisans. With John of Jandun,  Averroism perpetuates its most audacious propositions;  Eckhart and  Nicholas of Cusa formulate  philosophies which are symptomatic of the approaching revolution. The  Renaissance was a troublous period for  philosophy. Ancient systems were revived: the  Dialectic of the  Humanistic philologists ( Laurentius Valla , Vivés),  Platonism ,  Aristoteleanism ,  Stoicism .  Telesius ,  Campanella , and  Giordano Bruno follow a  naturalistic  philosophy. Natural and social  law are renewed with  Thomas More and   Grotius . All these  philosophies were leagued together against  Scholasticism , and very often against  Catholicism . On the other hand, the  Scholastic  philosophers grew weaker and weaker, and, excepting for the brilliant  Spanish  Scholasticism of the sixteenth century ( Bañez ,  Francisco Suárez ,  Vasquez , and so on), it may be said that  ignorance of the fundamental doctrine became general. In the seventeenth century there was no one to support  Scholasticism : it fell, not for lack of  ideas , but for lack of defenders.  Modern philosophy The  philosophies of the  Renaissance are mainly negative: modern  philosophy is, first and foremost, constructive. The latter is emancipated from all  dogma ; many of its syntheses are powerful; the definitive formation of the various nationalities and the diversity of languages favour the tendency to  individualism .  The two great initiators of modern  philosophy are  Descartes and  Francis Bacon . The former inaugurates a  spiritualistic philosophy based on the data of  consciousness , and his influence may be traced in  Malebranche ,  Spinoza , and  Leibniz .  Bacon heads a line of  Empiricists , who regarded sensation as the only source of  knowledge .  In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a Sensualist  philosophy grew up in  England , based on  Baconian  Empiricism , and soon to develop in the direction of Subjectivism. Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and David Hume mark the stages of this  logical evolution. Simultaneously an Associationist  psychology appeared also inspired by Sensualism, and, before long, it formed a special field of research. Brown, David Hartley, and Priestley developed the theory of  association of ideas in various directions. At the outset Sensualism encountered vigorous opposition, even in  England , from the  Mystics and  Platonists of the  Cambridge School (Samuel Parker and, especially, Ralph Cudworth). The reaction was still more lively in the  Scotch School, founded and chiefly represented by Thomas Reid, to which Adam Ferguson, Oswald, and Dugald Stewart belonged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and which had great influence over  Eclectic  Spiritualism , chiefly in  America and  France . Hobbes's "selfish" system was developed into a  morality by  Bentham , a partisan of  Egoistic Utilitarianism , and by Adam Smith, a defender of  Altruism , but provoked a reaction among the advocates of the moral sentiment theory (Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Samuel Clarke). In  England , also, Theism or  Deism was chiefly developed, instituting a criticism of all positive  religion , which it sought to supplant with a  philosophical  religion .  English Sensualism spread in  France during the eighteenth century: its influence is traceable in  de Condillac , de la Mettrie, and the  Encyclopedists ; Voltaire popularized it in  France and with Jean-Jacques Rousseau it made its way among the masses, undermining their  Christianity and preparing the Revolution of  1789. In  Germany , the  philosophy of the eighteenth century is, directly or indirectly, connected with  Leibniz  the School of Wolff, the Æsthetic School (Baumgarten), the  philosophy of sentiment. But all the  German  philosophers of the eighteenth century were eclipsed by the great figure of  Kant .  With  Kant (1724-1804) modern  philosophy enters its second period and takes a critical orientation.  Kant bases his theory of  knowledge , his  moral and  æsthetic system, and his judgments of finality on the structure of the  mind . In the first half of the eighteenth century,  German  philosophy is replete with great names connected with  Kantianism  after it had been put through a  Monistic evolution, however  Fichte, Schelling, and  Hegel have been called the triumvirate of  Pantheism ; then again, Schopenhauer, while  Herbart returned to  individualism .  French  philosophy in the nineteenth century is at first dominated by an  eclectic  Spiritualistic movement with which the names of Maine de Biran and, especially, Victor Cousin are associated. Cousin had  disciples in  America (C. Henry), and in  France he gained favour with those whom the excesses of the  Revolution had alarmed. In the first half of the nineteenth century  French  Catholics approved the  Traditionalism inaugurated by de Bonald and  de Lamennais , while another group took refuge in  Ontologism . In the same period Auguste Comte founded  Positivism , to which  Littré and Taine adhered, though it rose to its greatest height in the English-speaking countries. In fact,  England may be said to have been the second fatherland of  Positivism ; John Stuart Mill, Huxley, Alexander Bain and Herbert Spencer expanded its doctrines, combined them with Associationism and emphasized it criteriological aspect, or attempted (Spencer) to construct a vast synthesis of human  sciences . The Associationist  philosophy at this  time was confronted by the  Scotch  philosophy which, in  Hamilton , combined the teachings of Reid and of  Kant and found an  American champion in Noah Porter. Mansel spread the doctrines of Hamilton. Associationism regained favour with Thomas Brown and James Mill, but was soon enveloped in the large conception of  Positivism , the dominant  philosophy in  England . Lastly, in  Italy ,  Hegel was for a long  time the leader of nineteenth-century  philosophical thought (Vera and d'Ercole), whilst  Gioberti , the  ontologist and  Rosmini occupy a distinct position. More recently,  Positivism has gained numerous adherents in  Italy . In the middle of the century, a large Krausist School existed in  Spain , represented chiefly by Sanz del Rio (d. 1869) and N. Salmeron.  Balmes (1810-48), the author of "Fundamental Philosophy" is an original thinker whose doctrines have many points of contact with  Scholasticism .  Contemporary orientations Favourite problems Leaving aside social questions, the study of which belongs to  philosophy in only some of their aspects, it may be said that in the  philosophic interest of the present day  psychological questions hold the first place, and that chief among them is the problem of  certitude .  Kant , indeed, is so important a factor in the destinies of contemporary  philosophy not only because he is the initiator of critical formalism, but still more because he  obliges his successors to deal with the preliminary and fundamental question of the limits of  knowledge . On the other hand the experimental investigation of  mental processes has become the object of a new study, psycho-physiology, in which men of  science co-operate with  philosophers, and which meets with increasing success. This study figures in the programme of most modern  universities . Originating at  Leipzig (the School of Wundt) and  Würzburg , it has quickly become naturalized in  Europe and  America . In  America , "The Psychological Review" has devoted many articles to this branch of  philosophy.  Psychological studies are the chosen field of the  American (Ladd, William James, Hall).  The great success of  psychology has emphasized the subjective character of  æsthetics , in which hardly anyone now recognizes the objective and  metaphysical element. The solutions in vogue are the  Kantian , which represents the  æsthetic judgment as formed in accordance with the subjective, structural function of the  mind , or other  psychologic solutions which reduce the beautiful to a psychic impression (the "sympathy", or  Einfühlung , of Lipps; the "concrete intuition" of Benedetto Croce). These explanations are insufficient, as they neglect the objective aspect of the beautiful  those elements which, on the part of the object, are the  cause of the  æsthetic impression and enjoyment. It may be said that the  neo-Scholastic philosophy alone takes into account the objective  æsthetic factor.  The absorbing influence of  psychology also manifests itself to the detriment of other branches of  philosophy; first of all, to the detriment of  metaphysics , which our contemporaries have  unjustly ostracized   unjustly , since, if the  existence or possibility of a thing-in-itself is considered of importance, it behooves us to inquire under what aspects of reality it reveals itself. This ostracism of  metaphysics , moreover, is largely due to misconception and to a wrong understanding of the theories of  substance , of  faculties , of  causes etc., which belong to the traditional  metaphysics . Then again, the invasion of  psychology is manifest in  logic : side by side with the ancient  logic or  dialectic , a mathematical or  symbolic  logic has developed (Peano, Russell, Peirce, Mitchell, and others) and, more recently, a genetic  logic which would study, not the fixed laws of thought, but the changing process of  mental life and its genesis (Baldwin).  We have seen above ( section II, D ) how the increasing cultivation of  psychology has produced other  scientific ramifications which find favour with the learned world.  Moral  philosophy, long neglected, enjoys a renewed vogue notably in  America , where ethnography is devoted to its service ( see, e.g., the publications of the Smithsonian Institution). "The International Journal of Ethics" is a review especially devoted to this line of work. In some quarters, where the atmosphere is  Positivist , there is a desire to get rid of the old  morality , with its notions of value and of  duty , and to replace it with a collection of empiric rules subject to evolution (Sidgwick, Huxley, Leslie Stephen, Durkheim, Levy-Bruhl).  As to the history of  philosophy, not only are very extended special studies devoted to it, but more and more room is given it in the study of every  philosophic question. Among the  causes of this exaggerated vogue are the impulse given by the Schools of Cousin and of  Hegel , the progress of historical studies in general, the confusion arising from the clash of rival doctrines, and the distrust engendered by that confusion. Remarkable works have been produced by Deussen, on  Indian and  Oriental  philosophy; by Zeller, on  Greek antiquity; by  Denifle ,  Hauréau , Bäumker, and Mandonnet, on the  Middle Ages ; by Windelband, Kuno Fischer, Boutroux and Höffding, on the modern period; and the list might easily be considerably prolonged.  The opposing systems The rival systems of  philosophy of the present  time may be reduced to various groups:  Positivism , neo-Kantianism,  Monism ,  neo-Scholasticism . Contemporary  philosophy lives in an atmosphere of  Phenomenism , since  Positivism and neo-Kantianism are at one on this important  doctrine : that  science and  certitude are possible only within the limits of the world of phenomena, which is the immediate object of experience.  Positivism , insisting on the exclusive  rights of sensory experience, and  Kantian criticism, reasoning from the structure of our  cognitive faculties , hold that  knowledge extends only as far as appearances; that beyond this is the absolute, the dark depths, the  existence of which there is less and less disposition to deny, but which no  human  mind can fathom. On the contrary, this element of the absolute forms an integral constituent in  neo-Scholasticism which has revived, with sobriety and moderation, the fundamental notions of  Aristotelean and  Medieval  metaphysics , and has succeeded in vindicating them against attack and objection.  Positivism Positivism, under various forms, is defended in  England by the followers of Spencer, by Huxley, Lewes, Tyndall, F. Harrison, Congreve, Beesby, J. Bridges, Grant Allen (James Martineau is a reactionary against  Positivism ); by Balfour, who at the same time propounds a characteristic theory of  belief , and falls back on  Fideism . From  England  Positivism passed over to  America , where it soon dethroned the  Scottish doctrines (Carus). De Roberty, in  Russia , and Ribot, in  France , are among its most distinguished disciples. In  Italy it is found in the writings of Ferrari, Ardigo, and Morselli; in  Germany , in those of Laas, Riehl, Guyau, and Durkheim. Less brutal than  Materialism , the radical  vice of  Positivism is its identification of the knowable with the sensible. It seeks in vain to reduce general  ideas to collective images, and to deny the abstract and universal character of the  mind's concepts. It vainly denies the super-experiential value of the first  logical principles in which the  scientific life of the  mind is rooted; nor will it ever succeed in showing that the  certitude of such a judgment as 2 + 2 = 4 increases with our repeated addition of numbers of oxen or of coins. In  morals , where it would reduce  precepts and judgments to  sociological data formed in the collective  conscience and varying with the period and the environment,  Positivism stumbles against the judgments of value, and the supersensible  ideas of  obligation ,  moral  good , and  law , recorded in every  human  conscience and unvarying in their essential data.  Kantianism Kantianism had been forgotten in  Germany for some thirty years (1830-60); Vogt, Büchner, and Molesehott had won for  Materialism an ephemeral vogue; but  Materialism was swept away by a strong  Kantian reaction. This reversion towards  Kant ( Rückkehr zu Kant ) begins to be traceable in 1860 (notably as a result of Lange's "History of Materialism"), and the influence of  Kantian doctrines may be said to permeate the whole contemporary  German  philosophy (Otto Liebmann, von Hartmann, Paulsen, Rehmke, Dilthey, Natorp, Fueken, the Immanentists, and the Empirico-criticists).  French neo-Criticism, represented by Renouvier, was connected chiefly with  Kant's second "Critique" and introduced a specific  Voluntarism . Vacherot, Secrétan, Lachelier, Boutroux, Fouillée, and Bergson are all more or less under tribute to  Kantianism . Ravaisson proclaims himself a follower of Maine de Biran.  Kantianism has taken its place in the state programme of  education and Paul Janet, who, with F. Bouillier and Caro, was among the last legatees of Cousin's  Spiritualism , appears, in his "Testament philosophique", affecting a  Monism with a  Kantian inspiration. All those who, with  Kant and the  Positivists , proclaim the "bankruptcy of  science " look for the basis of our  certitude in an imperative demand of the  will . This  Voluntarism , also called  Pragmatism (William James), and, quite recently,  Humanism (Schiller at  Oxford ), is inadequate to the establishment of the theoretic  moral and social  sciences upon an unshakable base: sooner or later, reflection will ask what this need of living and of  willing is worth, and then the  intelligence will return to its position as the supreme arbiter of  certitude .  From  Germany and  France  Kantianism has spread everywhere. In  England it has called into activity the Critical  Idealism associated with T.H. Green and Bradley. Hodgson, on the contrary, returns to  Realism . S. Laurie may be placed between Green and Martineau. Emerson, Harris, Everett, and Royce spread  Idealistic Criticism in  America ; Shadworth Hodgson, on the other hand, and Adamson tend to return to  Realism , whilst James Ward emphasizes the function of the  will .  Monism With a great many  Kantians , a stratum of  Monistic  ideas is superimposed on Criticism, the thing in itself being considered numerically one. The same tendencies are observable among  Positivist Evolutionists like Clifford and Romanes, or G.T. Ladd.  Neo-Scholasticism Neo-Scholasticism , the revival of which dates from the last third of the nineteenth century ( Liberatore ,  Taparelli ,  Cornoldi , and others), and which received a powerful impulse under  Leo XIII , is tending more and more to become the  philosophy of  Catholics .  It replaces  Ontologism ,  Traditionalism , Gunther's  Dualism , and  Cartesian  Spiritualism , which had manifestly become insufficient. Its syntheses, renewed and completed, can be set up in opposition to  Positivism and  Kantianism , and even its adversaries no longer dream of denying the worth of its doctrines. The bearings of  neo-Scholasticism have been treated elsewhere (see  NEO-SCHOLASTICISM ).  Is progress in philosophy indefinite, or is there a philosophia perennis? Considering the historic succession of systems and the evolution of doctrines from the remotest ages of  India down to our own times, and standing face to face with the progress achieved by contemporary  scientific  philosophy, must we not infer the indefinite progress of  philosophic thought? Many have allowed themselves to be led away by this ideal dream. Historic  Idealism (Karl Marx) regards  philosophy as a product fatally engendered by pre-existing  causes in our physical and social environment. Auguste Comte's "law of the three states", Herbert Spencer's evolutionism,  Hegel's "indefinite becoming of the  soul ", sweep  philosophy along in an ascending current toward an ideal perfection, the realization of which no one can foresee. For all these thinkers,  philosophy is variable and relative: therein lies their serious  error . Indefinite progress, condemned by history in many fields, is untenable in the history of  philosophy. Such a notion is evidently refuted by the appearance of thinkers like  Aristotle and  Plato three centuries before  Christ , for these men, who for ages have dominated, and still dominate, human thought, would be anachronisms, since they would be inferior to the thinkers of our own  time . And no one would venture to assert this. History shows, indeed, that there are adaptations of a synthesis to its environment, and that every age has its own aspirations and its special way of looking at problems and their solutions; but it also presents unmistakable evidence of incessant new beginnings, of rhythmic oscillations from one pole of thought to the other. If  Kant found an original formula of Subjectivism and the  reine Innerlichkeit , it would be a mistake to think that  Kant had no  intellectual ancestors: he had them in the earliest historic ages of  philosophy: M. Deussen has found in the  Vedic  hymn of the Upanishads the distinction between noumenon and phenomenon, and writes, on the theory of Mâyâ, "Kants Grunddogma, so alt wie die Philosophie" ("Die Philos. des Upanishad's", Leipzig, 1899, p. 204).  It is  false to say that all  truth is relative to a given  time and latitude, and that  philosophy is the product of  economic  conditions in a ceaseless course of evolution, as historical  Materialism holds. Side by side with these things, which are subject to change and belong to one particular  condition of the  life of  mankind , there is a  soul of  truth circulating in every system, a mere fragment of that complete and unchangeable  truth which haunts the  human  mind in its most disinterested investigations. Amid the oscillations of historic systems there is room for a  philosophia perennis  as it were a purest atmosphere of  truth , enveloping the ages, its clearness somehow felt in spite of cloud and mist.  "The  truth  Pythagoras sought after, and  Plato , and  Aristotle , is the same that  Augustine and  Aquinas pursued. So far as it is developed in history,  truth is the daughter of  time ; so far as it bears within itself a content independent of  time , and therefore of history, it is the daughter of  eternity " [ Willmann , "Gesch. d Idealismus", II (Brunswick, 1896), 550; cf. Commer "Die immerwahrende Philosophie" (Vienna, 1899)].    This does not mean that essential and permanent  verities do not adapt themselves to the  intellectual life of each epoch. Absolute immobility in  philosophy, no less than absolute relativity, is contrary to  nature and to history. It leads to decadence and death. It is in this sense that we must interpret the adage:  Vita in motu .  Philosophy and the sciences Aristotle of old laid the foundation of a  philosophy supported by observation and experience. We need only glance through the list of his works to see that  astronomy , mineralogy,  physics and chemistry,  biology , zoology, furnished him with examples and bases for his theories on the constitution, of the heavenly and terrestrial bodies, the  nature of the  vital principle , etc. Besides, the whole  Aristotelean classification of the branches of  philosophy (see  section II ) is inspired by the same  idea of making  philosophy  general  science  rest upon the particular  sciences . The early  Middle Ages , with a rudimentary  scientific culture, regarded all its learning, built up on the  Trivium (grammar, rhetoric,  dialectic ) and  Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry,  astronomy , music), as preparation for  philosophy. In the thirteenth century, when  Scholasticism came under  Aristotelean influences, it incorporated the  sciences in the programme of  philosophy itself. This may be seen in regulation issued by the  Faculty of Arts of  Paris 19 March, 1255, "De libris qui legendi essent" This order prescribes the study of commentaries or various  scientific treatises of  Aristotle , notably those on the first book of the "Meteorologica", on the treatises on Heaven and Earth, Generation, the Senses and Sensations, Sleeping and Waking, Memory, Plants, and Animals. Here are amply sufficient means for the  magistri to familiarize the "artists" with  astronomy , botany, physiology, and zoology to say nothing of  Aristotle's "Physics", which was also prescribed as a classical text, and which afforded opportunities for numerous observations in chemistry and  physics as then understood. Grammar and rhetoric served as preliminary studies to  logic ,  Bible history, social science, and politics were introductory to  moral  philosophy. Such men as  Albertus Magnus and  Roger Bacon expressed their views on the  necessity of linking the  sciences with  philosophy and preached it by example. So that both antiquity and the  Middle Ages  knew and appreciated  scientific  philosophy.  In the seventeenth century the question of the relation between the two enters upon a new phase: from this period modern  science takes shape and begins that triumphal march which it is destined to continue through the twentieth century, and of which the  human  mind is justly proud. Modern  scientific  knowledge differs from that of antiquity and the  Middle Ages in three important respects: the multiplication of  sciences ; their independent value; the divergence between common  knowledge and  scientific  knowledge . In the  Middle Ages  astronomy was closely akin to  astrology , chemistry to  alchemy ,  physics to  divination ; modern  science has severely excluded all these fantastic connections. Considered now from one side and again from another, the physical world has revealed continually new aspects, and each specific point of view has become the focus of a new study. On the other hand, by defining their respective limits, the  sciences have acquired autonomy; useful in the  Middle Ages only as a preparation for rational  physics and for  metaphysics , they are nowadays of value for themselves, and no longer play the part of handmaids to  philosophy. Indeed, the progress achieved within itself by each particular  science brings one more revolution in  knowledge . So long as instruments of observation were imperfect, and  inductive methods restricted, it was practically impossible to rise above an elementary  knowledge . People  knew , in the  Middle Ages , that wine, when left exposed to the air, became vinegar; but what do facts like this amount to in comparison with the complex formulae of modern chemistry? Hence it was that an  Albertus Magnus or a  Roger Bacon could flatter himself, in those days, with having acquired all the  science of his  time , a claim which would now only provoke a smile. In every department progress has drawn the line sharply between popular and  scientific  knowledge ; the former is ordinarily the starting-point of the latter, but the conclusions and teachings involved in the  sciences are unintelligible to those who lack the requisite preparation.  Do not, then, these profound modifications in the  condition of the  sciences entail modifications in the relations which, until the seventeenth century, had been accepted as existing between the  sciences and  philosophy? Must not the separation of  philosophy and  science widen out to a complete divorce? Many have thought so, both  scientists and  philosophers, and it was for this that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries so many savants and  philosophers turned their backs on one another. For the former,  philosophy has become useless; the particular  sciences , they say, multiplying and becoming perfect, must exhaust the whole field of the knowable, and a  time will come when  philosophy shall be no more. For the  philosophers,  philosophy has no need of the immeasurable mass of  scientific notions which have been acquired, many of which possess only a precarious and provisional value. Wolff, who pronounced the divorce of  science from  philosophy, did most to accredit this view, and he has been followed by certain  Catholic  philosophers who held that  scientific study may be excluded from  philosophic culture.  What shall we say on this question? That the reasons which formerly existed for keeping touch with  science are a thousand times more imperative in our day. If the profound synthetic view of things which justifies the  existence of  philosophy presupposes analytical researches, the multiplication and perfection of those researches is certainly reason for neglecting them. The horizon of detailed  knowledge widens incessantly; research of every kind is busy exploring the departments of the  universe which it has mapped out. And  philosophy, whose mission is to explain the order of the  universe by general and ultimate reasons applicable, not only to a group of facts, but to the whole body of  known phenomena, cannot be indifferent to the  matter which it has to explain.  Philosophy is like a tower whence we obtain the panorama of a great city  its plan, its monuments, its great arteries, with the form and location of each  things which a visitor cannot discern while he goes through the streets and lanes, or visits  libraries ,  churches , palaces, and museums, one after another. If the city grows and develops, there is all the more reason, if we would  know it as a whole, why we should hesitate to ascend the tower and study from that height the plan upon which its new quarters have been laid out.  It is, happily, evident that contemporary  philosophy is inclined to be first and foremost a  scientific  philosophy; it has found its way back from its wanderings of yore. This is noticeable in  philosophers of the most opposite tendencies. There would be no end to the list if we had to enumerate every case where this orientation of  ideas has been adopted. "This union", says Boutroux, speaking of the  sciences and  philosophy, "is in  truth the classic tradition of  philosophy. But there had been established a  psychology and a  metaphysics which aspired to set themselves up beyond the  sciences , by mere reflection of the  mind upon itself. Nowadays all  philosophers are agreed to make  scientific data their starting-point" (Address at the International Congress of Philosophy in 1900;  Revue de Métaph. et de Morale , 1900, p. 697). Boutroux and many others spoke similarly at the International Congress of Bologna (April, 1911). Wundt introduces this union into the very definition of  philosophy, which, he says, is "the general  science whose function it is to unite in a system free of all contradictions the  knowledge acquired through the particular  sciences , and to reduce to their principles the general methods of  science and the  conditions of  knowledge supposed by them" ("Einleitung in die Philosophie", Leipzig, 1901, p. 19). And R. Eucken says: "The farther back the limits of the observable world recede, the more  conscious are we of the lack of an adequately comprehensive explanation"  "Gesammelte Aufsatze zur Philos. u. Lebensanschanung" (Leipzig, 1903), p. 157]. This same thought inspired  Leo XIII when he placed the parallel and harmonious teaching of  philosophy and of the  sciences on the programme of the Institute of Philosophy created by him in the  University of Louvain (see  NEO-SCHOLASTICISM ).  On their side, the  scientists have been coming to the same conclusions ever since they rose to a synthetic view of that  matter which is the object of their study. So it was with  Pasteur , so with Newton. Ostwald, professor of chemistry at  Leipzig , has undertaken to publish the "Annalen der Naturphilosophie", a review devoted to the cultivation of the territory which is common to  philosophy and the  sciences A great many men of  science , too, are engaged in  philosophy without knowing it: in their constant discussions of "Mechanism", "Evolutionism", "Transformism", they are using terms which imply a  philosophical theory of  matter .  If  philosophy is the explanation as a whole of that world which the particular  sciences investigate in detail, it follows that the latter find their culmination in the former, and that as the  sciences are so will  philosophy be. It is  true that objections are put forward against this way of uniting  philosophy and the  sciences . Common observation, it is said, is enough support for  philosophy. This is a mistake:  philosophy cannot ignore whole departments of  knowledge which are inaccessible to ordinary experience  biology , for example, has shed a new light on the  philosophic study of  man . Others again adduce the extent and the growth of the  sciences to show that  scientific  philosophy must ever remain an unattainable ideal; the practical solution of this difficulty concerns the teaching of  philosophy (see  section XI ).  Philosophy and religion  Religion presents to  man , with authority, the solution of  man's problems which also concern  philosophy. Such are the questions of the  nature of God , of  His relation with the visible world , of  man's origin and destiny. Now  religion , which precedes  philosophy in the social life, naturally  obliges it to take into consideration the points of  religious  doctrine . Hence the close connection of  philosophy with  religion in the early stages of civilization, a fact strikingly apparent in  Indian  philosophy, which, not only at its beginning but throughout its development, was intimately bound up with the  doctrine of the sacred books (see above). The  Greeks , at least during the most important periods of their history, were much less subject to the influences of  pagan  religions ; in fact, they combined with extreme scrupulosity in what concerned ceremonial usage a wide liberty in regard to  dogma .  Greek thought soon took its independent flight;  Socrates ridicules the gods in whom the common people  believed ;  Plato does not banish  religious  ideas from his  philosophy; but  Aristotle keeps them entirely apart, his  God is the   Actus purus  , with a meaning exclusively  philosophic, the prime mover of the universal  mechanism . The  Stoics point out that all things  obey an irresistible fatality and that the wise man  fears no gods. And if  Epicurus teaches cosmic  determinism and denies all finality, it is only to conclude that  man can lay aside all  fear of divine intervention in mundane affairs. The question takes a new aspect when the influences of the  Oriental and  Jewish  religions are brought to bear on  Greek  philosophy by  neo-Pythagorism , the  Jewish  theology (end of the first century), and, above all,  neo-Platonism (third century B.C.). A yearning for  religion was stirring in the world, and  philosophy became enamoured of every  religious doctrine Plotinus (third century after  Christ ), who must always remain the most perfect type of the  neo-Platonic mentality, makes  philosophy identical with  religion , assigning as its highest aim the union of the  soul with  God by  mystical ways. This  mystical need of the  supernatural issues in the most bizarre lucubrations from Plotinus's successors, e.g. Jamblicus (d. about A.D. 330), who, on a foundation of  neo-Platonism , erected an international pantheon for all the divinities whose names are  known .  It has often been remarked that  Christianity , with its  monotheistic  dogma and its serene, purifying  morality , came in the fulness of  time and appeased the inward unrest with which  souls were afflicted at the end of the Roman world. Though  Christ did not make Himself the head of a  philosophical school, the  religion which He founded supplies solutions for a group of problems which  philosophy solves by other methods (e.g. the  immortality of the  soul ). The first  Christian  philosophers, the  Fathers of the Church , were imbued with  Greek  ideas and took over from the circumambient  neo-Platonism the commingling of  philosophy and  religion . With them  philosophy is incidental and secondary, employed only to meet polemic needs, and to support  dogma ; their  philosophy is  religious . In this  Clement of Alexandria and  Origen are one with  St. Augustine and  Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite . The early  Middle Ages continued the same traditions, and the first  philosophers may be said to have received  neo-Platonic influences through the channel of the  Fathers .  John Scotus Eriugena (ninth century), the most remarkable  mind of this first period, writes that " true  religion is  true  philosophy and, conversely,  true  philosophy is  true  religion " (De div. praed., I, I). But as the era advances a process of dissociation sets in, to end in the complete separation between the two  sciences of  Scholastic theology or the study of  dogma , based fundamentally on  Holy Scripture , and  Scholastic philosophy , based on purely rational investigation. To understand the successive stages of this differentiation, which was not completed until the middle of the thirteenth century, we must draw attention to certain historical facts of capital importance.  (1) The origin of several  philosophical problems, in the early  Middle Ages , must be sought within the domain of  theology , in the sense that the  philosophical discussions arose in reference to  theological questions. The discussion, e.g. of  transubstantiation ( Berengarius of Tours ), raised the problem of  substance and of change, or becoming.  (2)  Theology being regarded as a superior and  sacred science , the whole pedagogic and didactic organization of the period tended to confirm this superiority (see  section XI ).  (3) The enthusiasm for dialectics, which reached its maximum in the eleventh century, brought into fashion certain purely verbal methods of reasoning bordering on the sophistical. Anselm of Besata (Anselmus Peripateticus) is the type of this kind of reasoner. Now the dialecticians, in discussing  theological subjects, claimed absolute validity for their methods, and they ended in such  heresies as  Gottschalk's on  predestination ,  Berengarius's on  transubstantiation , and  Roscelin's  Tritheism .  Berengarius's motto was: "Per omnia ad dialecticam confugere". There followed an excessive reaction on the part of timorous  theologians , practical men before all things, who charged dialectics with the  sins of the dialecticians. This antagonistic movement coincided with an attempt to reform  religious life . At the head of the group was  Peter Damian (1007-72), the adversary of the  liberal arts ; he was the author of the saying that  philosophy is the handmaid of  theology . From this saying it has been concluded that the  Middle Ages in general put  philosophy under tutelage, whereas the maxim was current only among a narrow circle of reactionary  theologians . Side by side with  Peter Damian in  Italy , were Manegold of Lautenbach and  Othloh of St. Emmeram , in  Germany .  (4) At the same time a new tendency becomes discernible in the eleventh century, in  Lanfranc ,  William of Hirschau , Rodulfus Ardens, and particularly  St. Anselm of Canterbury ; the  theologian calls in the aid of  philosophy to demonstrate certain  dogmas or to show their rational side.  St. Anselm , in an  Augustinian spirit, attempted this justification of  dogma , without perhaps invariably applying to the demonstrative value of his arguments the requisite limitations. In the thirteenth century these efforts resulted in a new  theological method, the  dialectic .  (5) While these disputes as to the relations of  philosophy and  theology went on, many  philosophical questions were nevertheless treated on their own account, as we have seen above ( universals ,  St. Anselm's  theodicy ,  Abelard's  philosophy, etc.).  (6) The  dialectic method, developed fully in the twelfth century, just when  Scholastic theology received a powerful impetus, is a  theological , not a  philosophical, method. The principal method in  theology is the interpretation of  Scripture and of authority; the  dialectic method is secondary and consists in first establishing a  dogma and then showing its reasonableness, confirming the argument from authority by the argument from  reason . It is a process of  apologetics . From the twelfth century onward, these two  theological methods are fairly distinguished by the words  auctoritates, rationes .  Scholastic theology , condensed in the  "summae" and "books of sentences", is henceforward regarded as distinct from  philosophy. The attitude of  theologians towards  philosophy is threefold: one group, the least influential, still opposes its introduction into  theology , and carries on the reactionary traditions of the preceding period (e.g. Gauthier de Saint-Victor); another accepts  philosophy, but takes a utilitarian view of it, regarding it merely as a prop of  dogma ( Peter Lombard ); a third group, the most influential, since it includes the three  theological schools of  St. Victor ,  Abelard , and  Gilbert de la Porrée , grants to  philosophy, in addition to this  apologetic role, an independent value which entitles it to be cultivated and studied for its own sake. The members of this group are at once both  theologians and  philosophers.  (7) At the opening of the thirteenth century one section of  Augustinian  theologians continued to emphasize the utilitarian and  apologetic office of  philosophy. But  St. Thomas Aquinas created new  Scholastic traditions, and wrote a chapter on  scientific methodology in which the distinctness and in dependence of the two  sciences is thoroughly established.  Duns Scotus , again, and the Terminists exaggerated this independence. Latin  Averroism , which had a brilliant but ephemeral vogue in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, accepted whole and entire in  philosophy  Averroistic Peripateticism, and, to safeguard  Catholic  orthodoxy , took refuge behind the sophism that what is  true in  philosophy may be  false in  theology , and conversely  wherein they were more reserved than  Averroes and the  Arab  philosophers, who regarded  religion as something inferior, good enough for the masses, and who did not trouble themselves about  Moslem orthodoxy.  Lully , going to extremes, maintained that all  dogma is susceptible of demonstration, and that  philosophy and  theology coalesce. Taken as a whole, the  Middle Ages , profoundly  religious , constantly sought to reconcile its  philosophy with the  Catholic  Faith . This bond the  Renaissance  philosophy severed. In the  Reformation period a group of publicists, in view of the prevailing strife, formed projects of reconciliation among the numerous  religious bodies. They convinced themselves that all  religions possess a common fund of essential  truths relating to  God , and that their content is identical, in spite of divergent  dogmas . Besides, Theism, being only a form of  Naturism applied to  religion , suited the independent ways of the  Renaissance . As in building up  natural law ,  human  nature was taken into consideration, so  reason was interrogated to discover  religious  ideas . And hence the wide acceptance of Theism, not among  Protestants only, but generally among  minds that had been carried away with the  Renaissance movement ( Erasmus , Coornheert).  For this  tolerance or  religious  indifferentism modern  philosophy in more than one instance substituted a disdain of positive  religions . The  English Theism or  Deism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries criticizes all positive  religion and, in the name of an innate  religious sense, builds up a natural  religion which is reducible to a collection of theses on the  existence of God and the  immortality of the  soul . The initiator of this movement was Herbert of Cherbury (1581-1648); J. Toland (1670-1722), Tindal (1656-1733), and Lord Bolingbroke took part in it. This criticizing movement inaugurated in  England was taken up in  France , where it combined with an outright  hatred of  Catholicism . Pierre Bayle (1646-1706) propounded the thesis that all  religion is anti-rational and absurd, and that a state composed of  Atheists is possible. Voltaire wished to substitute for  Catholicism an incoherent mass of doctrines about  God . The  religious  philosophy of the eighteenth century in  France led to  Atheism and paved the way for the  Revolution . In  justice to contemporary  philosophy it must be credited with teaching the amplest  tolerance towards the various  religions ; and in its programme of research it has included  religious  psychology , or the study of the  religious sentiment.  For  Catholic  philosophy the relations between  philosophy and  theology , between  reason and  faith , were fixed, in a chapter of  scientific methodology, by the great  Scholastic thinkers of the thirteenth century. Its principles, which still retain their vitality, are as follows:  (a) Distinctness of the two sciences.   The independence of  philosophy in regard to  theology , as in regard to any other  science whatsoever, is only an interpretation of this undeniable principle of  scientific progress, as applicable in the twentieth century as it was in the thirteenth, that a rightly constituted  science derives its formal object, its principles, and its constructive method from its own resources, and that, this being so, it cannot borrow from any other  science without compromising its own  right to exist.  (b) Negative, not positive, material, not formal, subordination of philosophy in regard to theology.   This means that, while the two  sciences keep their formal independence (the independence of the principles by which their investigations are guided), there are certain matters where  philosophy cannot contradict the solutions afforded by  theology . The  Scholastics of the  Middle Ages justified this subordination, being profoundly convinced that  Catholic  dogma contains the  infallible  word of God , the expression of  truth . Once a proposition, e.g. that two and two make four, has been accepted as  certain ,  logic forbids any other  science to form any conclusion subversive of that proposition. The material mutual subordination of the  sciences is one of those  laws out of which  logic makes the indispensable guarantee of the unity of  knowledge . "The  truth duly demonstrated by one  science serves as a beacon in another  science ." The  certainty of a theory in chemistry imposes its acceptance on  physics , and the  physicist who should go contrary to it would be out of his course. Similarly, the  philosopher cannot contradict the  certain data of  theology , any more than he can contradict the  certain conclusions of the individual  sciences . To deny this would be to deny the conformity of  truth with  truth , to contest the principle of contradiction, to surrender to a  relativism which is destructive of all  certitude . "It being supposed that nothing but what is  true is included in this  science ( sacred theology ) . . . it being supposed that whatever is  true by the decision and authority of this  science can nowise be  false by the decision of right  reason : these things, I say, being supposed, as it is manifest from them that the authority of this  science and  reason alike rest upon  truth , and one  verity cannot be contrary to another, it must be said absolutely that  reason can in no way be contrary to the authority of this  Scripture , nay, all right  reason is in accord with it" ( Henry of Ghent , "Summa Theologica", X, iii, n.4).  But when is a theory  certain ? This is a question of fact, and  error is easy. In proportion as the principle is simple and absolute, so are its applications complex and variable. It is not for  philosophy to establish the  certitude of  theological data, any more than to fix the conclusions of chemistry or of physiology. The  certainty of those data and those conclusions must proceed from another source. "The preconceived  idea is entertained that a  Catholic savant is a soldier in the service of his  religious  faith , and that, in his hands,  science is but a weapon to defend his  Credo . In the eyes of a great many people, the  Catholic savant seems to be always under the menace of  excommunication , or entangled in  dogmas which hamper him, and compelled, for the sake of loyalty to his  Faith , to renounce the disinterested love of  science and its free cultivation" ( Mercier , "Rapport sur les études supér. de philos.", 1891, p. 9). Nothing could be more  untrue .  The Catholic Church and philosophy The principles which govern the  doctrinal relations of  philosophy and  theology have moved the  Catholic  Church to intervene on various occasions in the history of  philosophy. As to the  Church's  right and  duty to intervene for the purpose of maintaining the integrity of  theological  dogma and the deposit of  faith , there is no need of discussion in this place. It is interesting, however, to note the attitude taken by the  Church towards  philosophy throughout the ages, and particularly in the  Middle Ages , when a civilization saturated with  Christianity had established extremely intimate relations between  theology and  philosophy.  A. The  censures of the  Church have never fallen upon  philosophy as such, but upon  theological applications, judged  false , which were based upon  philosophical reasonings.  John Scotus Eriugena ,  Roscelin ,  Berengarius ,  Abelard ,  Gilbert de la Porrée were condemned because their teachings tended to subvert  theological  dogmas .  Eriugena denied the substantial distinction between  God and created things ;  Roscelin held that there are three  Gods ;  Berengarius , that there is no real  transubstantiation in the  Eucharist ;  Abelard and  Gilbert de la Porrée essentially modified the  dogma of the  Trinity . The  Church , through her  councils , condemned their  theological  errors ; with their  philosophy as such she does not concern herself. " Nominalism ", says  Hauréau , "is the old enemy. It is, in fact, the  doctrine which, because it best accords with  reason , is most remote from axioms of  faith . Denounced before  council after  council ,  Nominalism was condemned in the person of  Abelard as it had been in the person of  Roscelin " ( Hist. philos. scol. , I, 292).  No assertion could be more inaccurate. What the  Church has condemned is neither the so-called  Nominalism , nor  Realism , nor  philosophy in general, nor the method of arguing in  theology , but certain applications of that method which are judged dangerous, i.e. matters which are not  philosophical. In the thirteenth century a host of teachers adopted the  philosophical theories of  Roscelin and  Abelard , and no  councils were convoked to condemn them. The same may be said of the condemnation of  David of Dinant (thirteenth century), who denied the distinction between  God and matter , and of various doctrines condemned in the fourteenth century as tending to the negation of  morality . It has been the same in modern times. To mention only the condemnation of  Gunther , of  Rosmini , and of  Ontologism in the nineteenth century, what alarmed the  Church was the fact that the theses in question had a theological bearing.  B.  The  Church has never imposed any  philosophical system, though she has  anathematized many doctrines, or branded them as suspect. This corresponds with the prohibitive, but not imperative attitude of  theology in regard to  philosophy. To take one example,  faith teaches that the  world was  created in  time ; and yet  St. Thomas maintains that the concept of  eternal  creation ( ab aeterno ) involves no contradiction. He did not think himself  obliged to demonstrate  creation in  time : his teaching would have been  heterodox only if, with the  Averroists his day, he had maintained the  necessary  eternity of the  world . It may, perhaps, be objected that many  Thomistic doctrines were condemned in 1277 by Etienne Tempier,  Bishop of  Paris . But it is well to note, and recent works on the subject have abundantly  proved this, that Tempier's condemnation, in so far as it applied to  Thomas Aquinas , was the issue of intrigues and personal animosity, and that, in  canon law , it had no force outside of the  Diocese of Paris . Moreover, it was annulled by one of Tempier's  successors , Etienne de Borrète, in 1325.  C.  The  Church has encouraged  philosophy. To say nothing of the fact that all those who applied themselves to  science and  philosophy in the  Middle Ages were  churchmen , and that the  liberal arts found an asylum in  capitular and  monastic  schools until the twelfth century, it is important to remark that the principal  universities of the  Middle Ages were pontifical foundations. This was the case with  Paris . To be sure, in the first years of the  university's aquaintance with the  Aristotelean encyclopaedia (late twelfth century) there were prohibitions against reading the "Physics", the "Metaphysics", and the treatise "On the Soul". But these restrictions were of a temporary character and arose out of particular circumstances. In 1231,  Gregory IX laid upon a commission of three consultors the charge to prepare an amended edition of  Aristotle "ne utile per inutile vitietur" (lest what is useful suffer damage through what is useless). The work of expurgatio was done, in point of fact, by the  Albertine - Thomist School, and, beginning from the year 1255, the  Faculty of Arts , with the  knowledge of the  ecclesiastical authority , ordered the teaching of all the books previously prohibited (see Mandonnet, "Siger de Brabant et l'averroïsme latin au XIIIe s.", Louvain, 1910). It might also be shown how in modern times and in our own day the  popes have encouraged  philosophic studies.  Leo XIII , as is well known, considered the restoration of  philosophic  Thomism on of the chief tasks of his pontificate.  The teaching of philosophy The methods of teaching  philosophy have varied in various ages.  Socrates used to interview his auditors, and hold symposia in the market-place, on the porticoes and in the public gardens. His method was interrogation; he whetted the curiosity of the audience and practised what had become known as  Socratic irony and the maieutic art ( maieutikê techne ), the art of delivering  minds of their conceptions. His  successor opened  schools properly so called, and from the place occupied by these  schools several systems took their names (the  Stoic School, the Academy, the Lyceum). In the  Middle Ages and down to the seventeenth century, the learned language was  Latin . The  German discourses of  Eckhart are mentioned as merely sporadic examples. From the ninth to the twelfth century teaching was confined to the  monastic and  cathedral  schools . It was the golden age of  schools . Masters and students went from one  school to another:  Lanfranc travelled over  Europe ;  John of Salisbury (twelfth century) heard at  Paris all the then famous professors of  philosophy;  Abelard gathered crowds about his rostrum. Moreover, as the same subjects were taught everywhere, and from the same text-books,  scholastic wanderings were attended with few disadvantages. The books took the form of commentaries or monographs. From the  time of  Abelard a method came into use which met with great success, that of setting forth the pros and cons of a question, which was later perfected by the addition of a  solutio . The application of this method was extended in the thirteenth century (e.g. in the  "Summa theologica" of  St. Thomas ). Lastly,  philosophy being an  educational preparation for  theology , the "Queen of the Sciences",  philosophical and  theological topics were combined in one and the same book, or even in the same lecture.  At the end of the twelfth century and the beginning of the thirteenth, the  University of Paris was organized, and  philosophical teaching was concentrated in the  Faculty of Arts . Teaching was dominated by two principles:  internationalism and  freedom . The student was an apprentice-professor: after receiving the various degrees, he obtained from the chancellor of the  university a licence to teach ( licentia docendi ). Many of the courses of this period have been preserved, the  abbreviated script of the  Middle Ages being virtually a stenographic system. The programme of courses drawn up in 1255 is well known: it comprises the  exegesis of all the books of  Aristotle . The commentary, or  lectio (from  legere , to read), is the ordinary form of instruction (whence the  German  Vorlesungen and the  English  lecture ). There were also disputations, in which questions were treated by means of objections and answers; the exercise took a lively character, each one being invited to contribute his thoughts on the subject. The  University of Paris was the model for all the others, notably those of  Oxford and  Cambridge . These forms of instruction in the  universities lasted as long as  Aristoteleanism , i.e. until the seventeenth century. In the eighteenth century  the  siècle des lumières (Erklärung)   philosophy took a popular and encyclopedic form, and was circulated in the literary productions of the period. In the nineteenth century it resumed its didactic attitude in the  universities and in the  seminaries , where, indeed its teaching had long continued. The advance of philological and historical studies had a great influence on the character of  philosophical teaching: critical methods were welcomed, and little by little the professors adopted the practice of specializing in this or that branch of  philosophy  a practice which is still in vogue. Without attempting to touch on all the questions involved in modern methods of teaching  philosophy, we shall here indicate some of the principal features.  The language of philosophy The earliest of the moderns  as  Descartes or  Leibniz  used both  Latin and the vernacular, but in the nineteenth century (except in  ecclesiastical seminaries and in certain academical exercises mainly ceremonial in character) the living languages supplanted  Latin ;  the result has been a gain in clearness of thought and  interest and vitality of teaching. Teaching in  Latin too often contents itself with formulae: the living language effects a better comprehension of things which must in any case be difficult. Personal experience, writes Fr. Hogan, formerly superior of the Boston Seminary, in his "Clerical Studies" (Philadelphia, 1895-1901), has shown that among students who have learned  philosophy, particularly  Scholastic , only in  Latin , very few have acquired anything more than a mass of formulae, which they hardly understand; though this does not always prevent their adhering to their formulae through thick and thin. Those who continue to write in  Latin  as many  Catholic  philosophers, often of the highest worth, still do  have the sad experience of seeing their books confined to a very narrow circle of readers.  Didactic processes Aristotle's advice, followed by the  Scholastics , still retains its value and its force: before giving the solution of a problem, expound the reasons for and against. This explains, in particular, the great part played by the history of  philosophy or the critical examination of the solutions proposed by the great thinkers. Commentary on a treatise still figures in some special higher courses; but contemporary  philosophical teaching is principally divided according to the numerous branches of  philosophy (see  section II ). The introduction of laboratories and practical  seminaries (séminaires practiques) in  philosophical teaching has been of the greatest advantage. Side by side with  libraries and shelves full of periodicals there is room for laboratories and museums, once the  necessity of vivifying  philosophy by contact with the  sciences is admitted (see  section VIII ). As for the practical  seminary , in which a group of students, with the aid of a teacher, investigate to some special problem, it may be applied to any branch of  philosophy with remarkable results. The work in common, where each directs his  individual efforts towards one general aim, makes each the beneficiary of the researches of all; it accustoms them to handling the instruments of research, facilitates the detection of facts, teaches the pupil how to discover for himself the reasons for what he observes, affords a real experience in the constructive methods of discovery proper to each subject, and very often decides the  scientific vocation of those whose efforts have been crowned with a first success.  The order of philosophical teaching One of the most complex questions is: With what branch ought  philosophical teaching to begin, and what order should it follow? In conformity with an immemorial tradition, the beginning is often made with  logic . Now  logic , the  science of  science , is difficult to understand and unattractive in the earliest stages of teaching. It is better to begin with the  sciences which take the real for their object:  psychology ,  cosmology ,  metaphysics , and  theodicy .  Scientific  logic will be better understood later on;  moral  philosophy presupposes  psychology ; systematic history of  philosophy requires a preliminary acquaintance with all the branches of  philosophy (see Mercier, "Manuel de philosophie", Introduction, third edition, Louvain, 1911).  Connected with this question of the order of teaching is another: viz. What should be the  scientific teaching preliminary to  philosophy? Only a course in the  sciences specially appropriate to  philosophy can meet the manifold exigencies of the problem. The general  scientific courses of our modern  universities include too much or too little: "too much in the sense that professional teaching must go into numerous technical facts and details with which  philosophy has nothing to do; too little, because professional teaching often makes the observation of facts its ultimate aim, whilst, from our standpoint, facts are, and can be, only a means, a starting-point, towards acquiring a  knowledge of the most general  causes and  laws " (Mercier, "Rapport sur les études supérieures de philosophie", Louvain, 1891, p. 25). M. Boutroux, a professor at the  Sorbonne , solves the problem of  philosophical teaching at the  university in the same sense, and, according to him, the flexible and very liberal organization of the faculty of  philosophy should include "the whole assemblage of the  sciences , whether theoretic, mathematico-physical, or philologico-historical" ("Revue internationale de l'enseignement", Paris, 1901, p. 510). The programme of courses of the Institute of Philosophy of  Louvain is drawn up in conformity with this spirit.    Sources GENERAL WORKS.  MERCIER,  Cours de philosophie. Logique.
