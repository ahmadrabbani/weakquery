<p><b>Cynicism</b> </p>
<p>After Plato and Aristotle, the concerns of the philosophers moved
further and further from metaphysics, epistemology, and anything
resembling modern science, to the issue that had always concerned the
ancient Greeks the most -- ethics.&nbsp; What is it to be virtuous, to
have character, to live the good life, to have &#8220;arete&#8221; (nobility)? </p>
<p><img src="antisthenes.JPG" alt=""
 style="width: 100px; height: 131px;" align="right" hspace="5"
 vspace="5"><b>Antisthenes</b> (445-365) was the son of an Athenian
citizen and
a Thracian
slave girl.&nbsp; After starting his own school, he came to recognize
that
Socrates was wiser than he.&nbsp; He went over, students and all, to
learn
from the master. </p>
<p>Antisthenes is the founder of <b>cynicism</b>.&nbsp; Cynic comes
from
the Greek word for dog, originally because Antisthenes taught at the
Cynosarges (Dogfish) gymnasium, which had been set up for the poor of
Athens. </p>
<p>Cynicism involves living the simple life in order that the soul can
be set free. It is a &#8220;back to nature&#8221; type of philosophy, ala St.
Francis of Assisi or the Hindu ascetics.&nbsp; By eliminating one&#8217;s
needs and possessions,
one can better
concentrate on the life of philosophy. </p>
<p>Cynicism makes virtue the only good, the only true happiness.&nbsp;
You can&#8217;t control the world and life&#8217;s ups and downs, so control
yourself!&nbsp; Inhibit your desires!&nbsp; become independent of the
world!&nbsp; &#8220;I would rather go mad than feel pleasure!&#8221;&nbsp; said
Antisthenes.&nbsp; Rejecting civilization, cynics tended to withdraw
from society, even to live in the desert.&nbsp; In this, they may have
influenced early Jewish and Christian monastics. </p>
<p>Cynicism wasn&#8217;t entirely negative (from today&#8217;s values
perspective):&nbsp; They strongly encouraged individualism, believed
that all men were brothers, were against war and slavery, and believed
in free speech.&nbsp; They also believed in the
legitimacy of suicide and, oddly, free love! </p>
<p>The most famous of the cynics was <b>Diogenes</b> (412-323), a
student of Antisthenes.&nbsp; He saw himself as a citizen of the world
(a &#8220;cosmopolitan&#8221;), yet for a time lived in a discarded clay jar.&nbsp;
There is a famous story that has Alexander the Great finding him
sleeping in the sun and announcing &#8220;I am Alexander the great
king!&#8221;&nbsp; Diogenes replied &#8220;I am Diogenes the dog!&#8221;&nbsp; Alexander
asked if there was anything he could do for him.&nbsp; Diogenes just
asked him to move out of the sun.<br>

<p><b>Hedonism</b> </p>
<p><img src="aristippus.gif" alt=""
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 79px; height: 112px;" align="left"
 hspace="5" vspace="5"><b>Aristippus</b> (435-355) was
also a student of Socrates.&nbsp;
Originally from Cyrene on the north coast of Africa, he returned there
to found his
own school, where he taught the philosophy of hedonism (from the Greek
word for pleasure).&nbsp; Hedonism
is
very simple:&nbsp; Whatever we do, we do to gain pleasure or to avoid
pain.&nbsp; Pleasure is the only good, and the achievement of pleasure
the only virtue.&nbsp; Morality is only a matter of culture and customs
and laws, something we now call ethical relativism.&nbsp; Further,
science, art, civilization in general, are good only to the extent that
they are useful in producing pleasure. </p>
<p>Note, however, that Aristuppus also taught that some pleasures are
higher than others, and that we should be slaves to none of
them.&nbsp; He was equally cheerful in good times and in poverty, and
despised useless displays of wealth. </p>
<p>He and his students lived as a part of a commune-like school where
all practiced what they preached, including free love, more than 2000
years
before Woodstock!&nbsp; Women were the full equals of men, and not only
hypothetically:&nbsp; His daughter <b>Arete</b> succeeded him in
leadership of the school and commune.&nbsp; She wrote 40 books herself
and was honored by the city of Cyrene with the title &#8220;Light of
Hellas.*&#8221;

<hr width="100%">
<p><b>Skepticism</b> </p>
<p><img src="pyrrho.jpeg" alt=""
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 79px; height: 111px;" align="right"
 hspace="5" vspace="5">Skepticism today is usually
considered a positive thing -- not to
accept anything on faith could be a motto for any number of famous
philosophers!&nbsp; In its origin, however, it was a bit more
extreme.&nbsp; <b>Pyrrho of Elis</b> (365-275) is usually credited
with founding the &#8220;school&#8221; of skepticism.&nbsp; It is believed that he
traveled to India and studied with the &#8220;gymnosophists&#8221; (naked lovers of
wisdom), which could have been any number of Indian sects.&nbsp; From
there, he brought back the idea that nothing can be known for
certain.&nbsp; The senses are easily fooled, and reason follows too
easily our desires.
</p>
<p>If we cannot ever know anything for certain, then we may as well
suspend our judgment, stop arguing over what will never be settled, and
try to find a little peace and tranquility in life.&nbsp; That
tranquility he called <b>ataraxia</b>.
&nbsp;Note that, although we can't know anything for certain, we can
know
many things well enough to get by. &nbsp;The sun may or may not rise
tomorrow
-- but the odds are good that it will, and what use would it serve to
worry
about it anyway! </p>
<p>Likewise, if no system is ultimately supportable, for the sake of
peace, simply adopt whatever system is prevalent in your neck of the
woods.&nbsp; Pyrrho lived out his life worshiping the gods of Elis,
although he would
certainly never acknowledge that they had any more likelihood of
reality
as any other gods, or no gods at all! &nbsp;There are many things a
skeptic
might accept for convenience, even though there be no ultimate proof.<br>
</p>
<p>Although at first glance this sounds positive, one of my students,
Annie Lam, said this:<br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Using Pyrrho&#8217;s reasoning, slavery would
still exist today because Black Americans should accept their role in
life as chattel in order to preserve peace in the community. Most
societies organize themselves into hierarchical systems, thus, those
groups of individuals who are lower on the hierarchy typically
experience oppression, and in some extreme examples may be dehumanized
and brutalized. I agree with the idea that nothing can be known for
certain; however, it is for this reason that I believe arguments and
debates should occur as opposed to being discouraged as advocated by
Pyrrho. It is only with the free and respectful exchange of ideas that
individuals can develop their personal values and beliefs in an
educated manner. I think if we sacrifice this exchange in order to
acquire ataraxia, we also sacrifice our ability to develop a genuine
self because self-reflection &#8211; judgment of self and others -- is not
encouraged.
</div>
<p>Later skeptics became prevalent among the students in Plato&#8217;s
Academy.&nbsp; One in particular, <b>Carneades of Cyrene</b>
(c.214-129 ), was notorious for arguing one side of an issue one day
and the other the next day.&nbsp; He said "There is absolutely no
criterion for truth. For reason, senses,
ideas, or whatever else may exist are all deceptive." </p>
<p> </p>
<hr width="100%">
<p><b>Stoicism</b> </p>
<p>"Only the educated are free." -- Epictetus </p>
<p><img alt="" src="zeno5.jpg"
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 160px; height: 218px;" align="left"
 hspace="10" vspace="5">The founder of stoicism is <b>Zeno
of Citium</b> (333-262) in
Cyprus.&nbsp; Zeno may have been Phoenician or part Phoenician.&nbsp;
He was
a student of the cynics, but was also influenced by Socrates.&nbsp; His
philosophy was similar to that of Antisthenes, but tempered by
reason.&nbsp; Basically, he believed in being virtuous, and that virtue
was a matter of submitting to God&#8217;s will.&nbsp; As usual for Greeks who
postulated a single god, Zeno did not strongly differentiate God from
nature.&nbsp; So another way of putting it is to live according to
nature (&#8220;Zen kata physin.&#8221;). </p>
<p>The school got its name from the Painted Porch (stoa poikile) in
Athens where Zeno studied.&nbsp; Walking up and down the open hallways,
he lectured his students on the value of <b>apatheia</b>, the absence
of passion, something not too different from the Buddhist idea of
non-attachment.&nbsp; By passion Zeno meant uncontrolled emotion or
physical desire. &nbsp;Only by taking this
attitude, he felt, could we develop wisdom and the ability to apply it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let no one break your will!&#8221;&nbsp; he said. Man conquers the world
by
conquering himself.&nbsp; Start by developing an indifference to pain
and pleasure,
through meditation.&nbsp; Wisdom occurs when reason controls
passions;&nbsp;
Evil occurs when passions control us. </p>
<p>Another aspect of Stoicism is its belief in the development of a
universal state, in which all men were brothers.&nbsp; Stoics believed
in certain
&#8220;natural rights,&#8221; a concept which we wouldn&#8217;t see again until the 18th
century.
They also believed in the right to commit suicide -- an important part
of
Roman cultural tradition. </p>
<p>The best presentation of stoicism is by the Greek slave <b>Epictetus</b>
(50-138 ad), who wrote during the Roman era.&nbsp; There is also a
little book, <b>Meditations</b>, by the Roman emperor <b>Marcus
Aurelius</b> (121-180 ad). </p>
<p> </p>
<hr width="100%">
<p><b>Epicureanism</b> </p>
<p>&#8220;The gods are not to be feared; death cannot be felt; the good can
be
won; all that we dread can be conquered.&#8221; -- Epicurus </p>
<p><b><img src="epicurus2.jpg" alt=""
 style="border: 1px solid ; width: 122px; height: 174px;" align="right"
 hspace="5" vspace="5">Epicurus</b> (341-270) was born on the island
of Samos in Ionia.&nbsp; At 19, went to Athens to study at the
Academy.&nbsp; It seemed, though,
that he liked the philosophy of Democritus better.&nbsp; The school he
founded was particularly egalitarian, accepting women and slaves.&nbsp;
Epicurus, it is said, wrote 300 books.&nbsp; Sadly, only fragments
survive. </p>
<p>Epicurus had little patience with religion, which he considered a
form of ignorance.&nbsp; He was particularly eager to help people loose
their
fear of the gods.&nbsp; He did, however, also say that the gods
existed,
although they lived far away in space somewhere and had little or
nothing
to do with people on earth.&nbsp; Atheism, you see, was still illegal
in
Athens! </p>
<p>One of the most persistent issues concerning belief in God is the
problem of evil.&nbsp; Epicurus's argument still holds up: </p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: left;">
<blockquote>Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?&nbsp; Then he
is not omnipotent. <br>
Is he able, but not willing?&nbsp; Then he is malevolent. <br>
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? <br>
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
Epicurus felt that it was useless to argue over metaphysics, that there
was no such thing as a soul that lived after death, that we arrived at
our
present condition by means of evolution, and that we had the quality of
free
will.
<p>We can see an almost &#8220;modern&#8221; materialism and empiricism here:&nbsp;
All things -- including minds -- are made of atoms and follow natural
laws.&nbsp; All knowledge comes from the senses.&nbsp; Thoughts and
memories are nothing but weak sensations.... </p>
<p>Virtue for Epicurus was a means to an end.&nbsp; That end is
happiness.&nbsp; It is good to feel pleasure and to avoid pain, but one
needs to apply reason to life.&nbsp; Sometimes pain is necessary in
order to gain happiness.&nbsp; Other times, pleasure leads to more
suffering than it is worth. </p>
<p>And there are levels of pain and pleasure, smaller and greater
happinesses.&nbsp; Friendship, for example, is rated one of the highest
pleasures.&nbsp; &#8220;A
sage loves his friends as he loves himself,&#8221; he said, and &#8220;It is better
to
give than to receive.&#8221;&nbsp; And &#8220;It is not possible to live pleasantly
without living prudently, honorably, and justly; nor to live prudently,
honorably, and justly without living pleasantly.&#8221;&nbsp; He reminds me
of Benjamin Franklin!<br>
</p>
<p>Society is seen as necessary:&nbsp; It protects one from
injustices.&nbsp; He foreshadows utilitarianism by suggesting that a
society should be arranged to provide the greatest happiness to the
greatest number. </p>
<p>The ultimate happiness, though, is peace, and he borrows Pyrrho&#8217;s
word for tranquility -- <b>ataraxia</b>.&nbsp; His motto was &#8220;lathe
biosas&#8221; -- live unobtrusively.&nbsp; He may be considered the first
true humanist, as witnessed by this quote: "Philosophy is an activity
that uses reasoning and rigorous argument to promote human
flourishing." </p>
<p>The best summary of epicureanism is the epic poem <b>On the Nature
of
Things</b> by Roman Lucretius (95-52). </p>
<p>Note the practical similarities between stoicism and epicureanism,
despite their theoretical differences!&nbsp; Both were popular in the
Roman era,
stoicism in Rome&#8217;s early, more vigorous years and continuing among the
rank
and file of Roman citizenry, and epicureanism (even hedonism) behind
closed
doors, especially at the highest levels of the empire. </p>
<p> </p>
<hr width="100%">
<p>Alexander the Great introduced what is called the <b>Hellenistic</b>*
period of history:&nbsp; His empire brought Greek ideas, art, language,
habits to &#8220;the world,&#8221; as far east as India and south as Egypt.&nbsp;
But, with his death at the age of 33, his empire began to come apart,
his generals dividing it amongst themselves and incompletely conquered
nations reasserting their independence. And a new people stood in the
wings to take over dominance
of the Mediterranean:&nbsp; The Romans. </p>
<p>And yet the influence of the Greeks would outlast the empire of
Alexander, its collapse, and even the Romans.&nbsp; But for now, the
world had
become a different place, a place of large powers maneuvering among
themselves, centralized
authorities just like those of Asia, huge trading and marketing
conglomerates
tightly tied to those authorities.&nbsp; Not quite the place for
individualistic
thinking and observation. </p>
