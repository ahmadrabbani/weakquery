We have worked extensively with public sector agencies and have promoted transportation infrastructure projects using funding from public or private entities. � � � � � Integrated Transport Planning Environmental forces, policies, the economy, and technology are changing modern society with a rapid pace.� The transportation sector is not immune to these forces of change.� New roads and international centers are emerging while existing ones are declining.� As competition in international transport occurs at a global scale, it is no exaggeration to say that the international strategy of a country determines its future economic development.� The Nippon Koei Group uses its strategic network of branch offices worldwide to constantly monitor the latest trends and developments in terms of overall transportation needs on a regional and country level. The rapid growth of population in urban areas of developing countries is causing serious traffic congestion, air pollution, uncontrolled expansion of urban areas, and loss of economic opportunities.� The dynamics of transportation in the cities are very complex.� Improvements in one area could create problems in another, so the relationship between different modes of transport should be clearly understood.� Therefore, the development of comprehensive master plans should continue based on solid analysis of the dynamics of urban transport.� With specialists in charge of all technical fields, our company offers a complete suite of services for the development of master plans for transportation, including traffic studies, design of traffic patterns, forecasts of demand for mass transit planning, policy planning and economic and financial evaluation. Roads and Tunnels Some countries of southeast asia are beginning to reach levels of maturity in the economy such that they can start their own independent infrastructure developments.� However, many countries around the world still require international financing and technical assistance with the development of road infrastructure.� Our company has a long history of providing engineering services for highways and tunnels in developing countries.� We fully understand the needs of governments and agencies on both sides of the equation of development assistance.� Based on years of experience and applying the latest technology in engineering road and tunnel projects, we pay particular attention to the policies of road transportation, environmental issues, management, and traffic control.� For rural areas, the use of flood control and disaster management on roads to protect the social environment and road network structure are a powerful part of our strategic plans.� We have high level technical expertise in the fields required for tunneling projects, including environmental, geology, soil analysis, planning and construction administration. The company has always adopted the latest technologies.� In recent years this has meant developments in geographic information systems (GIS), traffic simulation,� and intelligent transport systems.� Based on these technologies Nippon Koei can efficiently and flexibly meet the complex challenges of projects for modernization of roads and development without affecting the environment, protection and rehabilitation of existing roads, disaster management, road maintenance, and road safety projects.  Bridges In recent years, demand for care of the landscape and the environment have accompanied the change of socio-economic environment in developing countries.� The company adopts landscape simulation technology to create aesthetically pleasing bridges, participates in disaster management projects and safety inspections, and performs non-destructive testing and durability studies on existing bridges. We reinforce our work with our accumulated knowledge and advanced technical skills.� We maintain our own database of seismic activity, natural disasters and climate conditions around the world.� We have a thorough understanding of regional characteristics and the design capabilities of local firms.� We strengthen our own technical skills for design with advanced methods such as 3D analysis, finite element method, and dynamic analysis.� The company is highlighted particularly in complex bridge projects such as those that cross rivers, connect islands, allow the passage of vessels, and face complex configurations with restrictions, and those that cross land with tall cliffs. Airports Our experience ranges from engineering facilities such as airport runways, terminals, auxiliary buildings for technical and social uses, as well as planning airspace, noise control, poverty relief and relocation programs.� The company has participated in many large projects such as: 1.� Shanghai Pudong International Airport, China. 2.� Thailand International Airport runway expansi�n, cargo and passenger terminals, fire station, and other installations. 3.� Ground improvementes for the Second International Airport in Thailand 4.� Tan Son Nhat International Airport Terminal in Vietnam. 5.� Master Plan and Feasibility Study of the New International Airport in Guatemala. Railways Rail transport is experiencing a resurgence because of their high efficiency in energy and lower impact on the ecosystem compared with other modes of transport.� Based on our extensive experience in transportation engineering and project management, the company offers consulting services for various types of rail made to meet customer requirements. The experience of our firm on railways covers not only the development of railway infrastructure, but also the integration of complex subsystems such as railway signaling, telecommunications, track power, rolling stock, offices and workshops, and train operations.� Our wide range of consulting services also supports the planning of new railways and rehabilitation and upgrading of existing ones.� For example, in Manila, the Philippines, Nippon Koei has participated in the capacity expansion of the Light Rail Line No. 1 and the construction of Line 2.� In Tunisia, we assisted with the electrification of the South Suburban Line of Tunisia. As the role of railways in improving business earns a renewed emphasis, the commercial viability of existing operations is under scrutiny in many countries.� The sustainability of the railway business is highly dependent on the capacity of the railway administration, public or private.� The company's experience is ideal to assist with institutional revitalization and we offer consulting services for railway reform, and restructuring and privatization studies.� From 2003 to 2004, Nippon Koei conducted feasibility studies on the privatization of the Railway of Poland,� focusing on issues of corporate restructuring.  Ports and Coasts We offer a wide range of services for engineering projects for ports and coastal improvements and costs for the public and private sectors.� In Vietnam, for example, we have had involvement in projects at the ports of Cai Lan and Hai Pong; we prepared demand forecasts, regional development plans, plans for container terminals, and detailed design of jetties, breakwaters, rehabilitation, dredging, and coastal structures.� We also provide supervision of construction works or structures.� In El Salvador, we participated in the development of a container terminal and prepared a development plan to dock with the Panamax type container ships and other plans related to ports using different models of numerical simulation.� The development of fishing ports is another of our areas of expertise. In the area of development coasts, it is crucial that the concern for the environment and landscape are integrated into the planning and design of the project.� We conducted simulation studies combining computer or physical models with fields of study to ensure that the design and construction was responsible for issues such as the environment and aesthetics.� This approach was adopted to protect coastal areas and coral reefs on the island of Bali, Indonesia. Inland waterways can make a positive contribution to reducing carbon dioxide emissions and traffic congestion. We have sought ways of developing environmentally friendly internal transport, especially the Mekong River in Vietnam and Cambodia. In Latin America, the company is involved in major projects such as the La Union Port Development in El Salvador, and the Container Terminal Port Construction, of Callao, Peru.� Similarly, the firm has developed preliminary implementation plans for monorail mass transit systems in the cities of Panama City and Sao Paulo, Brazil. �       News  |  About Us  |  Clients  |  Markets  |  Projects  |  Careers  |  Contact us  |     Nippon Koei LAC CO., LTD.
