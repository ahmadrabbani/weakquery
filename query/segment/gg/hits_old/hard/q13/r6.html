AN HISTORICAL TIMELINE OF ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION
</font></B></H3>

I created this <b>Historical Timeline of Antarctic Exploration</b> for use as a handout for talks on Antarctic history. It was done somewhat hurriedly and I haven't got around to correcting a few of the errors that I know exist. Please feel free to comment or point out mistakes.
<p> It was created in Pagemaker at a size of 38 by 25 inches. The largest at which I've printed it out is 17 by 11 inches, just readable. It has been converted into an Adobe Acrobat document which will come up in your browser window when you <A HREF="timeline.pdf"><b> click here</b></A>.

CONCISE CHRONOLOGY OF APPROACH TO THE POLES
</font></B></H3> 
<p>
This chronology was prepared by <b>Robert K. Headland</b>, Archivist and Curator, Scott Polar Research Institute. It appears here courtesy of Mr Headland and SPRI. Note: Only the Antarctic portion is included here.
<p>
The following Antarctic and Arctic lists give explorations, in chronological order, towards the South Pole and North Pole, their attainment (air and surface, and by sea in the Arctic), and the first crossings of the regions. There are several claims included which are unverified and extremely doubtful, although some of these pretensions have been well publicised.
