Other stuff    350 B.C.    It was the ancient Greeks who first came up with the idea of Antarctica.  They knew about the Arctic - named Arktos -  The Bear, from the constellation the great bear and decided that in order to balance the world, there should be a similar cold Southern landmass that was the same but the opposite "Ant - Arktos" - opposite The Bear. They never actually went there, it was just a lucky guess!         1773   In January,   James Cook crosses the Antarctic circle   and circumnavigates Antarctica, though he doesn't sight land, deposits of rock seen in icebergs showed that a southern continent exists.  His comment - "  I make bold to declare that the world will derive no benefit from it  ".   1819 - 21      Captain Thaddeus Bellingshausen a Russian naval officer in the Vostok and Mirny   circumnavigates the Antarctic, first to cross the Antarctic circle since Cook.    He made the first sighting of the continent  , reaching 69° 21'S, 2° 14'W - describing an "icefield covered with small hillocks." on Jan 27th 1820.     For some considerable time, exactly who and when first set eyes on Antarctica were in dispute as     British naval officers, William Smith and Edward Bransfield also saw Antarctica on Jan 30th the same year - followed by American sealer Nathaniel Palmer on Nov 16th.   This was the first time a continent had truly been "discovered"  (i.e. there weren't any native peoples living there who'd known about it for ages already). All sightings are of the Antarctic Peninsula.   1821      February the 7th. 1st known landing  on continental Antarctica by American sealer Captain John Davis, though this is not acknowledged by all historians.    In the winter of 1821,   for the first time ever a party of men spent a winter in Antarctica.  An officer and ten men from a British sealing ship the   Lord Melville  had to spend the winter on King George Island -  part of the South Shetlands group, north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The ship had been driven offshore and did not return to pick them up again. They were rescued the following summer.   1823      British whaler   James Weddell  discovers the sea named after him and then reaches the most southerly point at that time 74° 15' S. No one else manages to penetrate the Weddell sea again for 80 years.   1840's   Separate British, French and American expeditions   establish the status of Antarctica as a continent  after sailing along continuous coastline.   In 1840, British naval officer and scientist  James Clark Ross takes two ships, the  Erebus and the Terror , to within 80 miles of the coast until stopped by a massive ice barrier - now called the Ross Ice Shelf. He also discovers the active volcano that he names after his ship Erebus, and identifies 145 new species of fish (not personally you understand - a scientist on the ship did that bit).   Late 1800's to early 20th century.   Many expeditions largely by sealers and whalers to all parts of Antarctica.  Mainly marine exploration and exploration of the sub Antarctic islands.          1898  March. Adrien de Gerlache  and the crew of the  "Belgica" become trapped in pack ice off the Antarctic Peninsul   a in the first scientific expedition to the continent.    They become the  first to survive an Antarctic winter           (involuntarily!) as their ship drifts with the ice (they didn't enjoy it).    1899   Carsten Borchgrevink  leads a British expedition that landed men at Cape Adare and built huts.   This was the   first time that anyone had wintered on the Antarctic landmass.   Believed by some historians to be the first confirmed landing on continental Antarctica.   1902     Captain Scott, UK, leads his first Antarctic expedition   to try to reach the South Pole, with Ernest Shackleton and Edward Wilson.  They are forced to turn back two months later having reached 82 degrees south, suffering from snow blindness and scurvy.     Several other publicly and privately sponsored expeditions around this time.   By now, these are driven by science, geography and exploration  - less by the exploitation of resources such as seals and whales.         1907 - 1909     Shackleton leads expedition to within 156km / 97mls of the South Pole   , turns back after supplies are exhausted.   1909  January, Australian  Douglas Mawson reaches the South Magnetic Pole.  1911           December 14th. Norwegian  Roald Amundsen  leads a five man expedition that reaches the South Pole for the first time.    1912       January 18th. Britain's  Captain  Robert Falcon Scott reaches the South Pole to discover he has been beaten by Amundsen.     All of the five man team (Scott, Bowers, Evans, Oates and Wilson), are to perish on the return journey only 11 miles from supply depot. Bodies are not discovered until November.   December.  Douglas Mawson begins his trek across George V Land back to his base at Commonwealth Bay.    His two companions had died, and against the odds he makes it home. A new section of coast is discovered and described, and radio is used for the first time in Antarctica.     1915   October.    Shackleton   returns to Antarctica in an attempt to complete the first crossing of the continent.   The goal is not attained, but    one of the greatest adventures of all time follows  . Their ship is crushed in the sea ice and a small party sets out for South Georgia and the whaling station.  The party is eventually rescued in 1917.     1  923    The beginning of large-scale factory ship whaling in the Ross Sea.       1928   Australian Sir George Wilkins and American Carl Benjamin Eielson are the   first to fly over Antarctica around the peninsula region.   1929  Richard E. Byrd and three others - US - become the first to fly over the South Pole.  1935  Lincoln Ellsworth - US - flies across the continent.  Caroline Mikkelsen, Norway,  is the  first woman to set foot on Antarctica when she accompanies her husband, a whaling captain.  1947   Operation Highjump - US  - sends the largest ever expedition of over 4700 men, 13 ships and 23 airplanes to Antarctica.  Most of the coast is photographed for map making.   1956   US aircraft lands at South Pole.  First people there since Scott and his team in 1912.   1st July 1957 - 31st Dec 1958   International Geophysical Year  (IGY)   12 nations establish over 60 stations in Antarctica. The beginning of international cooperation in Antarctica and the start of the process by which Antarctica becomes "non-national".     The  first successful land crossing via the South Pole is led by British geologist Vivian Fuchs    with     New Zealander     Edmund Hillary leading the back up party    , over 40 years after Shackleton's expedition set out with the same aim.    1961    Antarctic treaty comes into effect   1997   Boerge Ousland (Norway) becomes first person to cross Antarctica unsupported.   Taking 64 days from Berkner Island to Scott base towing a 180kg (400lb) sled and using skis and a sail.   March 2007 - March 2009   International Polar Year -   Actually Spans two years in order that researchers get the opportunity to work in both polar regions or work summer and winter if they wish.                 1776 - USA becomes independent from Great Britain 1780 - James Watt perfects the steam engine   1815 - Battle of Waterloo                                            1830 - World's first railway opens      1840 - Victoria becomes queen of Great Britain        1859 - Darwin publishes "Origin of Species"        1885 - Karl Benz builds the first motor car        1896 - Marconi invents wireless telegraph (radio)                    1901 - Australia becomes an independent nation.

If the logic is sound and argument convincing, it could be taken as the "Truth". The landmasses on Earth have been pretty much sorted out, so how about another planet - say Venus.  Can't see the surface - too cloudy    No contact ever, no radio waves  -    very primitive.    Closer to sun than us - hot and sweaty.  Similar (ish) to Earth ages ago. Humid - probably rainforests every where, very ancient         = Dinosaurs,      Bingo!  Observation - we can't see anything.  Conclusion  - Dinosaurs live there!      But hey, it's convincing and that's probably good enough. This idea of dinosaurs on Venus was "common knowledge" in the 1800's!    ***************************    Sealers Finger - The Seals Revenge!     Seals mouths are full of a very rich and varied fauna of exotic  bacteria  (as a friend of mine, an old Antarctic hand,  would describe it they're "goppin"). While trying to kill seals, sealers would often get bitten (hurrah!) and frequently on the fingers. The result would be a very nasty and painful infection as the finger went septic, followed by the loss of the use of that finger. It would still be there but completely immobile - known as "Sealers Finger".     ***************************       Wrap up warm     Today's scientists and explorers have the benefits of  modern fabrics and materials to help keep warm, windproof and dry. These materials are comfortable and lightweight and make conditions much better than in the early days.  Early Antarctic explorers had to make do with  heavy layers of itchy woollen fabrics and outer layers that would soak up the moisture produced by sweat. Getting dressed in the morning would often involve putting on layers that were frozen solid with ice in the fabric. As the garments gradually warmed up, they would become more flexible.   The same would happen to pretty much any clothing that was taken off before bed.            Eat well    Early explorers weren't as knowledgeable about nutrition in cold climates either (they learned much that we know today by finding out the hard way).  Humans get through much more food in a cold climate, burning it up and converting it to heat rather than energy for physical activity.  Early explorers therefore often went out relatively under stocked with food. This had a limiting effect on the achievements of the  earliest expeditions.  High energy combined with low weight is the best sort of food for expeditions in cold climates.  This usually meant a diet high in fat.  Early expeditions also went out with their food largely tinned or dried, this meant that it was low in vitamins that are destroyed by the canning process.  Scurvy  was therefore a very real problem.           1900 - 1922 is known as the  "Heroic Age" of Antarctic exploration.    The saying among old Antarctic hands was;   "For scientific discovery give me Scott, for speed and efficiency of travel give me Amundsen, but when you back's against the wall and there's no hope left, get down on your knees and pray for Shackleton".         Divide your food the Antarctic explorers way     Emotions about food on sledging expeditions frequently became almost obsessive. The traditional way of sharing out the often meagre rations was for the days appointed cook to divide the days food into as many equal portions as there were people as fairly as he could. One of the party would then turn his back, the cook would point to a portion and ask "whose?" The man who's turn it was would give the name of who would have that portion. This was done to avoid arguing about who received the largest meal. There were still sometimes complaints though that the cook and the person naming the meals had some kind of secret system organized between them.     Crumbs also became important.   When sledging biscuits were broken up, it was  done over something that would catch the falling crumbs so that nothing went to waste. The crumbs too were divided up fairly.      ***************************                   Custom Search    Home |  Site Map |  Pictures |  Antarctica Stock Photos |  Facts |  History |  Antarctica Travel |  Boots |  Video |  Books |  Calendars |  FIDS |  Feedback |  Antarctica Map |  Buy pictures |  Find a trip to Antarctica |  Ballet flats |  UGG Boots |  Schools |  Toys  Copyright    2001  Paul Ward   |   copyright issues   |   privacy policy   |
