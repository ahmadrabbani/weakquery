              westerly route to the Indies. Sailing down the coast of South America 
              he discovered the narrow straight passing through to the Pacific 
              Ocean which today bears his name. To the south lies Tierra del Fuego

              the crew were forced to eat some 14,000 penguins which they were 
              forced to kill for food. Stored as properly as possible, once they 
              reached the tropics the penguin meat spoiled and subsequently only 
              16 members of the original crew of 76 ever reached home shores.
