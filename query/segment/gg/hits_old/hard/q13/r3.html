               important Antarctic explorers were probably Roald
               Amundsen, Sir Ernest Shackleton, Robert Falcon Scott,
               and Richard E. Byrd.</B></FONT>
               
               <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>In December 1911, the first trip
               to the South Pole was held. It was held by a Norwegian
               scientist, Roald Amundsen, who lived from 1872 to
               1928. He was the first person to make it back all the
               way to his home. Other scientists could not make it
               back, and would die on their way either back to their
               ship or on their way back to their homes. It was
               surprising to all the people that he made it back. For
               more information on Amundsen, go to the
               </B></FONT><A HREF="http://www.mnc.net/norway/roald.html"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Roald

               <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The next explorer, Robert Falcon
               Scott, and Roald Amundsen were racing to the south
               pole. Their teams started at different points and got
               there at different times. The first one to get there
               was Amundsen, and five weeks later, Scott got there.
               Scott's team died on there way back to their ship
               because they were wearing wool instead of heavy down
               parkas. Amundsen's team wore heavy down parkas and
               made it back to their homes. It was a very long and
               difficult journey, and it took them almost two years
               to do it. They were traveling by foot, on sled, and in
               their ships for over 2000 miles!</B></FONT></P>
               
               <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>In 1911, a British trip was led
               by Robert Falcon Scott. He reached the South Pole five
               weeks after Amundsen. Instead of using regular
               materials, like down parkas and other Antarctic winter
               equipment, they used wool. Wool is not a very heavy
               material. When Scott and his crew were leaving and
               hiking back to their ship, wearing wool, they stopped
               for a break about a mile from their ship. It was so
               cold that they froze to death. Scott was born in 1868
               and died in 1912, the year after he came
               there.</B></FONT></P>
               
               <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Another very famous explorer was
               Richard E. Byrd. He lived from 1868 to 1957. He was
               the first person to accomplish a flight over
               Antarctica as an American explorer. After he
               accomplished that goal, he worked as a United States
               naval officer. There is a part of Antarctica named
               after his wife, Marie Byrd, though the place is called
               "Marie Byrd Land."</B></FONT></P>
               
               <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Probably the most famous
               explorer of them all is Sir Ernest Shackleton. He was
               born on February 17, 1874, and died on January 25,
               1922, on South Georgia Island. When he went to
               Antarctica for the first time in 1901-1902 with Robert
               Falcon Scott (see above), almost no one had gone there
               before. He made another trip to Antarctica in
               1907-1909. </B></FONT></P>
               
               <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>In 1914, he organized a third
               trip to Antarctica. His ship was called the
               <I><U>Endurance</U></I>. It got stuck in the ice in
               1915, which forced Shackleton and his crew to abandon
               the ship. Finally, he organized three teams to go in
               the three rowboats. In order to rescue his crew,
               Shackleton rowed 800 miles to South Georgia Island and
               got help there. He managed to get every person on his
               crew back safely to England.<BR>
