<strong>                                </strong>
<strong> The newspapers were filled with pictures of happy relatives</strong>
<strong>of the victims of the December 21, 1988 bombing of PanAm 103 over</strong>
<strong>Lockerbie, Scotland.  A Libyan, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi,</strong>
<strong>had been found guilty of the crime the day before, January 31,</strong>
<strong>2001, by a Scottish court in the Hague, though his co-defendant,</strong>
<strong>Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, was acquitted.  At long last there was</strong>
<strong>going to be some kind of closure for the families. </strong>
<strong> But what was wrong with this picture?</strong>
<strong> What was wrong was that the evidence against Megrahi was</strong>
<strong>thin to the point of transparency.  Coming the month after the</strong>
<strong>(s)election of George W. Bush, the Hague verdict could have been</strong>
<strong>dubbed Supreme Court II, another instance of non-judicial factors</strong>
<strong>fatally clouding judicial reasoning.  The three Scottish judges</strong>
<strong>could not have relished returning to the United Kingdom after</strong>
<strong>finding both defendants innocent of the murder of 270 people,</strong>
<strong>largely from the U.K. and the United States.  Not to mention</strong>
<strong>having to face dozens of hysterical victims' family members in</strong>
<strong>the courtroom.  The three judges also well knew the fervent</strong>
<strong>desires of the White House and Downing Street as to the outcome. </strong>
<strong>If both men had been acquitted, the United States and Great</strong>
<strong>Britain would have had to answer for a decade of sanctions and</strong>
<strong>ill will directed toward Libya.</strong>
<strong> One has to read the entire 26,000-word "Opinion of the</strong>
<strong>Court", as well as being very familiar with the history of the</strong>
<strong>case going back to 1988, to appreciate how questionable was the</strong>
<strong>judges' verdict. </strong>
<strong> The key charge against Megrahi -- the <em>sine qua non</em> -- was</strong>
<strong>that he placed explosives in a suitcase and tagged it so it would</strong>
<strong>lead the following charmed life: 1)loaded aboard an Air Malta</strong>
<strong>flight to Frankfurt without an accompanying passenger;</strong>
<strong>2)transferred in Frankfurt to the PanAm 103A flight to London</strong>
<strong>without an accompanying passenger; 3)transferred in London to the</strong>
<strong>PanAm 103 flight to New York without an accompanying passenger.</strong>
<strong> To the magic bullet of the JFK assassination, can we now add</strong>
<strong>the magic suitcase?</strong>
<strong> This scenario by itself would have been a major feat and so</strong>
<strong>unlikely to succeed that any terrorist with any common sense</strong>
<strong>would have found a better way.  But aside from anything else, we</strong>
<strong>have this -- as to the first step, loading the suitcase at Malta:</strong>
<strong>there was no witness, no video, no document, no fingerprints,</strong>
<strong>nothing to tie Megrahi to the particular brown Samsonite</strong>
<strong>suitcase, no past history of terrorism, no forensic evidence of</strong>
<strong>any kind linking him or Fhimah to such an act.</strong>
<strong> And the court admitted it: "The absence of any explanation</strong>
<strong>of the method by which the primary suitcase might have been</strong>
<strong>placed on board KM180 [Air Malta] is a major difficulty for the</strong>
<strong>Crown case."{1}</strong>
<strong> Moreover, under security requirements in 1988, unaccompanied</strong>
<strong>baggage was subjected to special X-ray examinations, plus --</strong>
<strong>because of recent arrests in Germany -- the security personnel in</strong>
<strong>Frankfurt were on the lookout specifically for a bomb secreted in</strong>
<strong>a radio, which turned out to indeed be the method used with the</strong>
<strong>PanAm 103 bomb.</strong>
<strong> Requiring some sort of direct and credible testimony linking</strong>
<strong>Megrahi to the bombing, the Hague court placed great -- nay,</strong>
<strong>paramount -- weight upon the supposed identification of the</strong>
<strong>Libyan by a shopkeeper in Malta, as the purchaser of the clothing</strong>
<strong>found in the bomb suitcase.  But this shopkeeper had earlier</strong>
<strong>identified several other people as the culprit, including one who</strong>
<strong>was a CIA agent.{1a}  When he finally identified Megrahi from a</strong>
<strong>photo, it was after Megrahi's photo had been in the world news</strong>
<strong>for years.  The court acknowledged the possible danger inherent</strong>
<strong>in such a verification: "These identifications were criticised</strong>
<strong><em>inter alia</em> on the ground that photographs of the accused have</strong>
<strong>featured many times over the years in the media and accordingly</strong>
<strong>purported identifications more than 10 years after the event are</strong>
<strong>of little if any value."{2}</strong>
<strong> There were also major discrepancies between the shopkeeper's</strong>
<strong>original description of the clothes-buyer and Megrahi's actual</strong>
<strong>appearance.  The shopkeeper told police that the customer was</strong>
<strong>"six feet or more in height" and "was about 50 years of age."</strong>
<strong>Megrahi was 5'8" tall and was 36 in 1988.  The judges again</strong>
<strong>acknowledged the weakness of their argument by conceding that the</strong>
<strong>initial description "would not in a number of respects fit the</strong>
<strong>first accused [Megrahi]" and that "it has to be accepted that</strong>
<strong>there was a substantial discrepancy."{3}  <br>   Nevertheless, the judges went ahead and accepted the <br>identification as accurate. Before the indictment of the two <br>Libyans in Washington in November 1991, the press had reported <br>police findings that the clothing had been purchased on <br>November 23, 1988.{4}  But the indictment of Megrahi states <br>that he made the purchase on December 7.  Can this be because <br>the investigators were able to document Megrahi being in Malta <br>(where he worked for Libya Airlines) on that date but cannot <br>do so for November 23?{5}</strong>
<strong> There is also this to be considered -- If the bomber needed</strong>
<strong>some clothing to wrap up an ultra-secret bomb in a suitcase,</strong>
<strong>would he go to a clothing store in the city where he planned to</strong>
<strong>carry out his dastardly deed, where he knew he'd likely be</strong>
<strong>remembered as an obvious foreigner, and buy brand new, easily</strong>
<strong>traceable items?   Would an intelligence officer -- which Megrahi</strong>
<strong>was alleged to be -- do this?  Or even a common boob?  Wouldn't</strong>
<strong>it make more sense to use any old clothing, from anywhere?</strong>
<strong> Furthermore, after the world was repeatedly assured that</strong>
<strong>these items of clothing were sold only on Malta, it was learned</strong>
<strong>that at least one of the items was actually "sold at dozens of</strong>
<strong>outlets throughout Europe, and it was impossible to trace the</strong>
<strong>purchaser."{6}</strong>
<strong> The "Opinion of the Court" placed considerable weight on the</strong>
<strong>suspicious behavior of Megrahi prior to the fatal day, making</strong>
<strong>much of his comings and goings abroad, phone calls to unknown</strong>
<strong>parties for unknown reasons, the use of a pseudonym, etc.</strong>
<strong>The three judges tried to squeeze as much mileage out of these</strong>
<strong>events as they could, as if they had no better case to make.</strong>
<strong>But if Megrahi was indeed a member of Libyan intelligence, we</strong>
<strong>must consider that intelligence agents have been known to act in</strong>
<strong>mysterious ways, for whatever assignment they're on.  The court,</strong>
<strong>however, had no idea what assignment, if any, Megrahi was working</strong>
<strong>on.</strong>
<strong> There is much more that is known about the case that makes</strong>
<strong>the court verdict and written opinion questionable, although</strong>
<strong>credit must be given the court for its frankness about what it</strong>
<strong>was doing, even while it was doing it.  "We are aware that in</strong>
<strong>relation to certain aspects of the case there are a number of</strong>
<strong>uncertainties and qualifications," the judges wrote.  "We are</strong>
<strong>also aware that there is a danger that by selecting parts of the</strong>
<strong>evidence which seem to fit together and ignoring parts which</strong>
<strong>might not fit, it is possible to read into a mass of conflicting</strong>
<strong>evidence a pattern or conclusion which is not really justified."{7}</strong>
<strong> It is remarkable, given all that the judges conceded was</strong>
<strong>questionable or uncertain in the trial -- not to mention all that</strong>
<strong>was questionable or uncertain that they <em>didn't</em> concede -- that at</strong>
<strong>the end of the day they could still declare to the world that</strong>
<strong>"There is nothing in the evidence which leaves us with any</strong>
<strong>reasonable doubt as to the guilt of [Megrahi]".{8}</strong>
<strong> <em>The Guardian</em> of London later wrote that two days before the</strong>
<strong>verdict, "senior Foreign Office officials briefed a group of</strong>
<strong>journalists in London.  They painted a picture of a bright new</strong>
<strong>chapter in Britain's relations with Colonel Gadafy's regime. </strong>
<strong>They made it quite clear they assumed both the Libyans in the</strong>
<strong>dock would be acquitted.  The Foreign Office officials were not</strong>
<strong>alone.  Most independent observers believed it was impossible for</strong>
<strong>the court to find the prosecution had proved its case against</strong>
<strong>Megrahi beyond reasonable doubt."{9}</strong><br><br><strong><font color="#0000FF">Alternative scenario</font></strong>
<strong>There is, moreover, an alternative scenario, laying the</strong>
<strong>blame on Palestinians, Iran and Syria, which is much better</strong>
<strong>documented and makes a lot more sense, logistically and</strong>
<strong>otherwise.</strong>
<strong> Indeed, this was the Original Official Version, delivered</strong>
<strong>with Olympian rectitude by the U.S. government -- guaranteed,</strong>
<strong>sworn to, scout's honor, case closed -- until the buildup to the</strong>
<strong>Gulf War came along in 1990 and the support of Iran and Syria was</strong>
<strong>needed.</strong>
<strong> Washington was anxious as well to achieve the release of</strong>
<strong>American hostages held in Lebanon by groups close to Iran.  Thus</strong>
<strong>it was that the scurrying sound of backtracking became audible in</strong>
<strong>the corridors of the White House.</strong>
<strong> Suddenly -- or so it seemed -- in October 1990, there was a</strong>
<strong>New Official Version: It was Libya -- the Arab state least</strong>
<strong>supportive of the U.S. build-up to the Gulf War and the sanctions</strong>
<strong>imposed against Iraq -- that was behind the bombing after all,</strong>
<strong>declared Washington. </strong>
<strong>        The two Libyans were formally indicted in the U.S. and</strong>
<strong>Scotland on Nov. 14, 1991.</strong>
<strong> "This was a Libyan government operation from start to</strong>
<strong>finish," declared the State Department spokesman.{10}</strong>
<strong> "The Syrians took a bum rap on this," said President George</strong>
<strong>H.W. Bush.{11}</strong>
<strong> Within the next 20 days, the remaining four American</strong>
<strong>hostages were released along with the most prominent British</strong>
<strong>hostage, Terry Waite.</strong>
<strong>       The Original Official Version accused the PFLP-GC, a 1968</strong>
<strong>breakaway from a component of the Palestine Liberation</strong>
<strong>Organization, of making the bomb and somehow placing it</strong>
<strong>aboard the flight in Frankfurt.</strong>
<strong>       The PFLP-GC was led by Ahmed Jabril, one of the world's</strong>
<strong>leading terrorists, and was headquartered in, financed by, and</strong>
<strong>closely supported by, Syria.  The bombing was allegedly done at</strong>
<strong>the behest of Iran as revenge for the U.S. shooting down of an</strong>
<strong>Iranian passenger plane over the Persian Gulf on July 3, 1988,</strong>
<strong>which claimed 290 lives.</strong>
<strong>      The support for this scenario was, and remains, impressive,</strong>
<strong>as the following sample indicates:</strong>
<strong>     In April 1989, the FBI -- in response to criticism that it</strong>
<strong>was bungling the investigation -- leaked to CBS the news that it</strong>
<strong>had tentatively identified the person who unwittingly carried the</strong>
<strong>bomb aboard.  His name was Khalid Jaafar, a 21-year-old Lebanese-</strong>
<strong>American.  The report said that the bomb had been planted in</strong>
<strong>Jaafar's suitcase by a member of the PFLP-GC, whose name was not</strong>
<strong>revealed.{12}</strong>
<strong>     In May, the State Department stated that the CIA was</strong>
<strong>"confident" of the Iran-Syria-PFLP-GC account of events.{13}</strong>
<strong>     On Sept. 20, <em>The Times</em> of London reported that "security</strong>
<strong>officials from Britain, the United States and West Germany are</strong>
<strong>'totally satisfied' that it was the PFLP-GC" behind the crime.</strong>
<strong>     In December 1989, Scottish investigators announced that they</strong>
<strong>had "hard evidence" of the involvement of the PFLP-GC in the</strong>
<strong>bombing.{14}</strong>
<strong>     A National Security Agency electronic intercept disclosed</strong>
<strong>that Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, Iranian interior minister, had paid</strong>
<strong>Palestinian terrorists $10 million dollars to gain revenge for</strong>
<strong>the downed Iranian airplane.(15)  The intercept appears to have</strong>
<strong>occurred in July 1988, shortly after the downing of the Iranian</strong>
<strong>plane.</strong>
<strong>     Israeli intelligence also intercepted a communication</strong>
<strong>between Mohtashemi and the Iranian embassy in Beirut "indicating</strong>
<strong>that Iran paid for the Lockerbie bombing."{16}</strong>
<strong>     Even after the Libyans had been indicted, Israeli officials</strong>
<strong>declared that their intelligence analysts remained convinced that</strong>
<strong>the PFLP-GC bore primary responsibility for the bombing.{17}</strong>
<strong>     In 1992, Abu Sharif, a political adviser to PLO chairman</strong>
<strong>Yasser Arafat, stated that the PLO had compiled a secret report</strong>
<strong>which concluded that the bombing of 103 was the work of a "Middle</strong>
<strong>Eastern country" other than Libya.{18}</strong>
<strong>     In February 1995, former Scottish Office minister, Alan</strong>
<strong>Stewart, wrote to the British Foreign Secretary and the Lord</strong>
<strong>Advocate, questioning the reliability of evidence which had led</strong>
<strong>to the accusations against the two Libyans.  This move, wrote <em>The</em></strong>
<strong><em>Guardian</em>, reflected the concern of the Scottish legal profession,</strong>
<strong>reaching into the Crown Office (Scotland's equivalent of the</strong>
<strong>Attorney General's Office), that the bombing may not have been</strong>
<strong>the work of Libya, but of Syrians, Palestinians and Iranians.{19}</strong>
<strong>     We must also ask why Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,</strong>
<strong>writing in her 1993 memoirs about the US bombing of Libya in</strong>
<strong>1986, with which Britain had cooperated, stated: "But the much</strong>
<strong>vaunted Libyan counter-attack did not and could not take place. </strong>
<strong>Gaddafy had not been destroyed but he had been humbled.  There</strong>
<strong>was a marked decline in Libyan-sponsored terrorism in succeeding</strong>
<strong>years."{20}</strong><br><br><strong><font color="#0000FF">Key Question</font></strong>
<strong>A key question in the PFLP-GC version has always been: How did</strong>
<strong>the bomb get aboard the plane in Frankfurt, or at some other</strong>
<strong>point?  One widely disseminated explanation was in a report,</strong>
<strong>completed during the summer of 1989 and leaked in the fall, which</strong>
<strong>had been prepared by a New York investigating firm called</strong>
<strong>Interfor.  Headed by a former Israeli intelligence agent, Juval</strong>
<strong>Aviv, Interfor -- whose other clients included Fortune 500</strong>
<strong>companies, the FBI, IRS and Secret Service{21} -- was hired by</strong>
<strong>the law firm representing PanAm's insurance carrier.</strong>
<strong>The Interfor Report said that in the mid-1980s, a drug and</strong>
<strong>arms smuggling operation was set up in various European cities,</strong>
<strong>with Frankfurt airport as the site of one of the drug routes. </strong>
<strong>The Frankfurt operation was run by Manzer Al-Kassar, a Syrian,</strong>
<strong>the same man from whom Oliver North's shadowy network purchased</strong>
<strong>large quantities of arms for the contras.  At the airport,</strong>
<strong>according to the report, a courier would board a flight with</strong>
<strong>checked luggage containing innocent items; after the luggage had</strong>
<strong>passed all security checks, one or another accomplice Turkish</strong>
<strong>baggage handler for PanAm would substitute an identical suitcase</strong>
<strong>containing contraband; the passenger then picked up this suitcase</strong>
<strong>upon arrival at the destination.</strong>
<strong>     The only courier named by Interfor was Khalid Jaafar, who,</strong>
<strong>as noted above, had been named by the FBI a few months earlier as</strong>
<strong>the person who unwittingly carried the bomb aboard.</strong>
<strong>     The Interfor report spins a web much too lengthy and complex</strong>
<strong>to go into here.  The short version is that the CIA in Germany</strong>
<strong>discovered the airport drug operation and learned also that</strong>
<strong>Kassar had the contacts to gain the release of American hostages</strong>
<strong>in Lebanon.  He had already done the same for French hostages. </strong>
<strong>Thus it was, that the CIA and the German Bundeskriminalamt (BKA,</strong>
<strong>Federal Criminal Office) allowed the drug operation to continue</strong>
<strong>in hopes of effecting the release of American hostages.  </strong>
<strong>According to the report, this same smuggling ring and its</strong>
<strong>method of switching suitcases at the Frankfurt airport were used</strong>
<strong>to smuggle the fatal bomb aboard flight 103, under the eyes of</strong>
<strong>the CIA and BKA. </strong>
<strong>     In January 1990, Interfor gave three of the baggage handlers</strong>
<strong>polygraphs and two of them were judged as being deceitful when</strong>
<strong>denying any involvement in baggage switching.  However, neither</strong>
<strong>the U.S., UK or German investigators showed any interest in the</strong>
<strong>results, or in questioning the baggage handlers.  Instead, the</strong>
<strong>polygrapher, James Keefe, was hauled before a Washington grand</strong>
<strong>jury, and, as he puts it, "They were bent on destroying my</strong>
<strong>credibility -- not theirs" [the baggage handlers].  To Interfor,</strong>
<strong>the lack of interest in the polygraph results and the attempt at</strong>
<strong>intimidation of Keefe was the strongest evidence of a cover-up by</strong>
<strong>the various government authorities who did not want their</strong>
<strong>permissive role in the baggage switching to be revealed.{22}</strong>
<strong> Critics claimed that the Interfor report had been inspired</strong>
<strong>by PanAm's interest in proving that it was impossible for normal</strong>
<strong>airline security to have prevented the loading of the bomb, thus</strong>
<strong>removing the basis for accusing the airline of negligence.</strong>
<strong> The report was the principal reason PanAm's attorneys</strong>
<strong>subpoenaed the FBI, CIA, DEA, State Department, National Security</strong>
<strong>Council, and NSA, as well as, reportedly, the Defense</strong>
<strong>Intelligence Agency and FAA, to turn over all documents relating</strong>
<strong>to the crash of 103 or to a drug operation preceding the crash. </strong>
<strong>The government moved to quash the subpoenas on grounds of</strong>
<strong>"national security", and refused to turn over a single document</strong>
<strong>in open court, although it gave some to a judge to view</strong>
<strong>privately.</strong>
<strong> The judge later commented that he was "troubled about</strong> <br><strong>certain parts" of what he'd read, adding "I don't know quite <br>what</strong> <strong>to do because I think some of the material may be <br>significant."{23}</strong><br><br><strong><font color="#0000FF">Drugs Revelation</font></strong>
<strong>On October 30, 1990, NBC-TV News reported that "PanAm flights</strong>
<strong>from Frankfurt, including 103, had been used a number of times by</strong>
<strong>the DEA as part of its undercover operation to fly informants and</strong>
<strong>suitcases of heroin into Detroit as part of a sting operation to</strong>
<strong>catch dealers in Detroit."</strong>
<strong> The TV network reported that the DEA was looking into the</strong>
<strong>possibility that a young man who lived in Michigan and regularly</strong>
<strong>visited the Middle East may have unwittingly carried the bomb</strong>
<strong>aboard flight 103.  His name was Khalid Jaafar.  "Unidentified</strong>
<strong>law enforcement sources" were cited as saying that Jaafar had</strong>
<strong>been a DEA informant and was involved in a drug-sting operation</strong>
<strong>based out of Cyprus.  The DEA was investigating whether the</strong>
<strong>PFLP-GC had tricked Jaafar into carrying a suitcase containing</strong>
<strong>the bomb instead of the drugs he usually carried.</strong>
<strong> The NBC report quoted an airline source as saying:</strong>
<strong>"Informants would put [suit]cases of heroin on the PanAm flights</strong>
<strong>apparently without the usual security checks, through an</strong>
<strong>arrangement between the DEA and German authorities."{24}</strong>
<strong> These revelations were enough to inspire a congressional</strong>
<strong>hearing, held in December, entitled, "Drug Enforcement</strong>
<strong>Administration's Alleged Connection to the PanAm Flight 103</strong>
<strong>Disaster".</strong>
<strong> The chairman of the committee, Cong. Robert Wise (Dem., W.</strong>
<strong>VA.), began the hearing by lamenting the fact that the DEA and</strong>
<strong>the Department of Justice had not made any of their field agents</strong>
<strong>who were most knowledgeable about flight 103 available to</strong>
<strong>testify; that they had not provided requested written</strong>
<strong>information, including the results of the DEA's investigation</strong>
<strong>into the air disaster; and that "the FBI to this date has been</strong>
<strong>totally uncooperative".</strong>
<strong> The two DEA officials who did testify admitted that the</strong>
<strong>agency had, in fact, run "controlled drug deliveries" through</strong>
<strong>Frankfurt airport with the cooperation of German authorities,</strong>
<strong>using U.S. airlines, but insisted that no such operation had been</strong>
<strong>conducted in December 1988.  (The drug agency had said nothing of</strong>
<strong>its sting operation to the President's Commission on Aviation</strong>
<strong>Security and Terrorism which had held hearings in the first</strong>
<strong>months of 1990 in response to the 103 bombing.)</strong>
<strong> The officials denied that the DEA had had any "association</strong>
<strong>with Mr. Jaafar in any way, shape, or form."  However, to</strong>
<strong>questions concerning Jaafar's background, family, and his</strong>
<strong>frequent trips to Lebanon, they asked to respond only in closed</strong>
<strong>session.  They made the same request in response to several other</strong>
<strong>questions.{25}  </strong>
<strong> NBC News had reported on October 30 that the DEA had told</strong>
<strong>law enforcement officers in Detroit not to talk to the media</strong>
<strong>about Jaafar.</strong>
<strong> The hearing ended after but one day, even though Wise had</strong>
<strong>promised a "full-scale" investigation and indicated during the</strong>
<strong>hearing that there would be more to come.  What was said in the</strong>
<strong>closed sessions remains closed.{26}</strong>
<strong> One of the DEA officials who testified, Stephen Greene, had</strong>
<strong>himself had a reservation on flight 103, but he canceled because</strong>
<strong>of one or more of the several international warnings that had</strong>
<strong>preceded the fateful day.  He has described standing on the</strong>
<strong>Heathrow tarmac, watching the doomed plane take off.{27}</strong>
<strong> There have been many reports of heroin being found in the</strong>
<strong>field around the crash, from "traces" to "a substantial quantity"</strong>
<strong>found in a suitcase.{28}  Two days after the NBC report, however,</strong>
<strong>the <em>New York Times</em> quoted a "federal official" saying that "no</strong>
<strong>hard drugs were aboard the aircraft."</strong><br><br><strong><font color="#0000FF">The film</font></strong>
<strong>In 1994, American filmmaker Allan Francovich completed a</strong>
<strong>documentary, "The Maltese Double Cross", which presents Jaafar as</strong>
<strong>an unwitting bomb carrier with ties to the DEA and the CIA. </strong>
<strong>Showings of the film in Britain were canceled under threat of law</strong>
<strong>suits, venues burglarized or attacked by arsonists.  When Channel</strong>
<strong>4 agreed to show the film, the Scottish Crown Office and the U.S.</strong>
<strong>Embassy in London sent press packs to the media, labeling the</strong>
<strong>film "blatant propaganda" and attacking some of the film's</strong>
<strong>interviewees, including Juval Aviv the head of Interfor.{29}  </strong>
<strong>Aviv paid a price for his report and his outspokenness. </strong>
<strong>Over a period of time, his New York office suffered a series of</strong>
<strong>break-ins, the FBI visited his clients, his polygrapher was</strong>
<strong>harassed, as mentioned above, and a contrived commercial fraud</strong>
<strong>charge was brought against him.  Even though Aviv eventually was</strong>
<strong>cleared in court, it was a long, expensive, and painful</strong>
<strong>ordeal.{30}    </strong>
<strong> Francovich also stated that he had learned that five CIA</strong>
<strong>operatives had been sent to London and Cyprus to discredit the</strong>
<strong>film while it was being made, that his office phones were tapped,</strong>
<strong>that staff cars were sabotaged, and that one of his researchers</strong>
<strong>narrowly escaped an attempt to force his vehicle into the path of</strong>
<strong>an oncoming truck.{31}</strong>
<strong> Government officials examining the Lockerbie bombing went so</strong>
<strong>far as to ask the FBI to investigate the film.  The Bureau later</strong>
<strong>issued a highly derogatory opinion of it.{32}</strong>
<strong> The film's detractors made much of the fact that the film</strong>
<strong>was initially funded jointly by a UK company (two-thirds) and a</strong>
<strong>Libyan government investment arm (one-third).  Francovich said</strong>
<strong>that he was fully aware of this and had taken pains to negotiate</strong>
<strong>a guarantee of independence from any interference.</strong>
<strong> On April 17, 1997, Allan Francovich suddenly died of a heart</strong>
<strong>attack at age 56, upon arrival at Houston Airport.{33}  His film</strong>
<strong>has had virtually no showings in the United States.</strong><br><br><strong><font color="#0000FF">Abu Talb</font></strong>
<strong>The DEA sting operation and Interfor's baggage-handler hypothesis</strong>
<strong>both predicate the bomb suitcase being placed aboard the plane in</strong>
<strong>Frankfurt without going through the normal security checks.  In</strong>
<strong>either case, it eliminates the need for the questionable</strong>
<strong>triple-unaccompanied baggage scenario.  With either scenario the</strong>
<strong>clothing could still have been purchased in Malta, but in any</strong>
<strong>event we don't need the Libyans for that.</strong>
<strong> Mohammed Abu Talb fits that and perhaps other pieces of the</strong>
<strong>puzzle.  The Palestinian had close ties to PFLP-GC cells in</strong>
<strong>Germany which were making Toshiba radio-cassette bombs, similar,</strong>
<strong>if not identical, to what was used to bring down 103.  In October</strong>
<strong>1988, two months before Lockerbie, the German police raided these</strong>
<strong>cells, finding several such bombs.  In May 1989, Talb was</strong>
<strong>arrested in Sweden, where he lived, and was later convicted of</strong>
<strong>taking part in several bombings of the offices of American</strong>
<strong>airline companies in Scandinavia.  In his Swedish flat, police</strong>
<strong>found large quantities of clothing made in Malta.  </strong>
<strong> Police investigation of Talb disclosed that during October</strong>
<strong>1988 he had been to Cyprus and Malta, at least once in the</strong>
<strong>company of Hafez Dalkamoni, the leader of the German PFLP-GC, who</strong>
<strong>was arrested in the raid.  The men met with PFLP-GC members who</strong>
<strong>lived in Malta.  Talb was also in Malta on November 23, which was</strong>
<strong>originally reported as the date of the clothing purchase before</strong>
<strong>the indictment of the Libyans, as mentioned earlier.</strong>
<strong> After his arrest, Talb told investigators that between</strong>
<strong>October and December 1988 he had retrieved and passed to another</strong>
<strong>person a bomb that had been hidden in a building used by the</strong>
<strong>PFLP-GC in Germany.  Officials declined to identify the person to</strong>
<strong>whom Talb said he had passed the bomb.  A month later, however,</strong>
<strong>he recanted his confession.</strong>
<strong> Talb was reported to possess a brown Samsonite suitcase and</strong>
<strong>to have circled December 21 in a diary seized in his Swedish flat. </strong>
<strong>After the raid upon his flat, his wife was heard to telephone</strong>
<strong>Palestinian friends and say: "Get rid of the clothes."</strong>
<strong> In December 1989, Scottish police, in papers filed with</strong>
<strong>Swedish legal officials, made Talb the only publicly identified</strong>
<strong>suspect "in the murder or participation in the murder of 270</strong>
<strong>people"; the Palestinian subsequently became another of the</strong>
<strong>several individuals to be identified by the Maltese shopkeeper</strong>
<strong>from a photo as the clothing purchaser.{34}  Since that time, the</strong>
<strong>world has scarcely heard of Abu Talb, who was sentenced to life</strong>
<strong>in prison in Sweden, but never charged with anything to do with</strong>
<strong>Lockerbie.</strong>
<strong> In Allan Francovich's film, members of Khalid Jaafar's family</strong>
<strong>-- which long had ties to the drug trade in Lebanon's notorious</strong>
<strong>Bekaa Valley -- are interviewed.  In either halting English or</strong>
<strong>translated Arabic, or paraphrased by the film's narrator, they</strong>
<strong>drop many bits of information, but which are difficult to put</strong>
<strong>together into a coherent whole.  Amongst the bits ... Khalid had</strong>
<strong>told his parents that he'd met Talb in Sweden and had been given</strong>
<strong>Maltese clothing ... someone had given Khalid a tape recorder, or</strong>
<strong>put one into his bag ... he was told to go to Germany to friends</strong>
<strong>of PFLP-GC leader Ahmed Jabril who would help him earn some money</strong>
<strong>... he arrived in Germany with two kilos of heroin ... "He didn't</strong>
<strong>know it was a bomb.  They gave him the drugs to take to Germany. </strong>
<strong>He didn't know.  Who wants to die?" ...</strong>
<strong> It can not be stated with certainty what happened at</strong>
<strong>Frankfurt airport on that fateful day, if, as seems most likely,</strong>
<strong>that is the place where the bomb was placed into the system. </strong>
<strong>Either Jaafar, the DEA courier, arrived with his suitcase of</strong>
<strong>heroin and bomb and was escorted through security by the proper</strong>
<strong>authorities, or this was a day he was a courier for Manzer</strong>
<strong>al-Kassar, and the baggage handlers did their usual switch. </strong>
<strong>Or perhaps we'll never know for sure what happened.  </strong>
<strong> On February 16, 1990, a group of British relatives of Lockerbie</strong>
<strong>victims went to the American Embassy in London for a meeting with</strong>
<strong>members of the President's Commission on Aviation Security and</strong>
<strong>Terrorism.  After the meeting, Britisher Martin Cadman was</strong>
<strong>chatting with two of the commission members.  He later reported</strong>
<strong>what one of them had said to him: "Your government and our</strong>
<strong>government know exactly what happened at Lockerbie.  But they are</strong>
<strong>not going to tell you."{35}</strong><br><br><strong><font color="#0000FF">Comments about the Hague Court verdict</font></strong>
<strong> "The judges nearly agreed with the defense.  In their</strong>
<strong>verdict, they tossed out much of the prosecution witnesses'</strong>
<strong>evidence as false or questionable and said the prosecution had</strong>
<strong>failed to prove crucial elements, including the route that the</strong>
<strong>bomb suitcase took." -- <em>New York Times</em> analysis.{36}</strong>
<strong> "It sure does look like they bent over backwards to find a</strong>
<strong>way to convict, and you have to assume the political context of</strong>
<strong>the case influenced them." -- Michael Scharf, professor, New</strong>
<strong>England School of Law.{37}</strong>
<strong> "I thought this was a very, very weak circumstantial</strong>
<strong>case.  I am absolutely astounded, astonished.  I was extremely</strong>
<strong>reluctant to believe that any Scottish judge would convict</strong>
<strong>anyone, even a Libyan, on the basis of such evidence." -- Robert</strong>
<strong>Black, Scottish law professor who was the architect of the Hague</strong>
<strong>trial.{38}</strong>
<strong> "A general pattern of the trial consisted in the fact that</strong>
<strong>virtually all people presented by the prosecution as key</strong>
<strong>witnesses were proven to lack credibility to a very high extent,</strong>
<strong>in certain cases even having openly lied to the court."</strong>
<strong>  "While the first accused was found 'guilty', the second</strong>
<strong>accused was found 'not guilty'. ... This is totally</strong>
<strong>incomprehensible for any rational observer when one considers</strong>
<strong>that the indictment in its very essence was based on the joint</strong>
<strong>action of the two accused in Malta."</strong>
<strong>  "As to the undersigned's knowledge, there is not a single</strong>
<strong>piece of material evidence linking the two accused to the crime. </strong>
<strong>In such a context, the guilty verdict in regard to the first</strong>
<strong>accused appears to be arbitrary, even irrational. ... This leads</strong>
<strong>the undersigned to the suspicion that political considerations</strong>
<strong>may have been overriding a strictly judicial evaluation of the</strong>
<strong>case ... Regrettably, through the conduct of the Court,</strong>
<strong>disservice has been done to the important cause of international</strong>
<strong>criminal justice." -- Hans Koechler, appointed as an international <br>observer of the Lockerbie Trial by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.{39}</strong>
<strong>So, let's hope that Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi is really</strong>
<strong>guilty.  It would be a terrible shame if he spends the rest of</strong>
<strong>his life in prison because back in 1990 Washington's hegemonic</strong>
<strong>plans for the Middle East needed a convenient enemy, which just</strong>
<strong>happened to be his country.</strong>
