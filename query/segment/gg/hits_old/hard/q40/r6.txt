Jordan    Note  It is known that many more Allied merchant ships were sunk by Japanese naval surface ships, aircraft, submarines, and possibly in minefields planted by submarines. However, this is all that I have been able to find names for. If you have additional documented information on Allied merchant ship losses other than those listed above, please contact either  Dan Muir or  Arie Biemond .  NOTE !  The list "Allied Merchant Ship Losses" is not yet completely completed, and there still may be some mistakes regarding some ships, so please take this information (list) with some "reserve" and not as a final one. Mr. Dan Muir and Mr. Arie Biemond are, however, trying to compile the list and make it accurate as much as possible. Information about several ships (like tonnage, date of sinking, name ...) are different in English and Dutch sources, so they need to be examined again.  Note  According to Roger Jordan's book, the British ships  Silksworth, Autolycus, Malda, Shinkuang, Dardanus, Gandara  and  Indora  were all sunk by the Japanese cruiser fleet in the Gulf of Bengal on April 6th, 1942, together with five other Allied ships.  Note  The first Japanese merchant vessel sunk in the Pacific War 1941-1945 was freighter  Awazisan Maru  , sunk by RAAF aircraft on December 8th, 1941 off Kota Bharu, followed by the  Takao Maru,  sunk by USAAF aircraft on December 10th, 1941, West of Luzon.  Note  The Dutch Merchant Navy lost during the World War Two in total 525 merchant ships measuring 1.692.773 tons. The Merchant Ship Losses in the Dutch East Indies between December 1941 - March 1942 counted in total 128 ships (24 % of total loss) measuring 285.000 tons (17% of total loss).
