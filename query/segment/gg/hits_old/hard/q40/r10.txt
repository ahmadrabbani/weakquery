This ugly reality has been demonstrated repeatedly since the early 1940s, but the message seems to be forgotten with remarkable regularity. The advent of modern anti-ship cruise missiles, especially types with sea-skimming trajectories, adds a further dimension to an issue which was well proven during the Second World War. It is worth observing that a large number of Allied vessels were sunk or damaged by German Fritx-X and Hs-293 guided glidebombs during that period  [ Click for more ... ]  .  The first 'modern' casualty of an antishipping missile attack was the Israeli destroyer Eilat, sunk by four Styx ASCMs launched by Soviet supplied fast missile boats, operated by Egypt. It is also worth observing that the last major campaign involving sustained aerial and missile attacks on a surface fleet was during the Falklands conflict, 23 years ago. It represents the only genuinely useful case study since the   Second World War.  While AAW and ASMD systems have improved considerably since then, so have the anti-ship cruise missiles in the global market.    British losses in warships and lives would have been considerably greater were it not for the persistent problems experienced by the Argentines with fusing in the Exocet ASCMs and 1,000 lb dumb bombs used in these attacks. It is of importance that many of the key problems experienced in the Falklands are inherent to the use of warships without protective AEW&C, aerial refuelling tanker and fighter cover, and thus cannot be wished away by putting bigger radars and more defensive systems on warships. In this type of combat, the initiative always lies with the attacker  [ Click for more ... ]  . Suffice to say the lethality of first generation sea-skimmers and 1,000 lb dumb bombs cannot compare against the contemporary weapons being acquired across the Pacific Rim and Indian Ocean regions [ Click for more ... ].  This webpage will display examples of damage effects inflicted on surface vessels by anti-shipping cruise missiles, and air delivered bombs.

The weapons were delivered by II/KG100 flying Do-217K-2 bombers from Istres in France, with the strike credited to Major Benhard Jopp, Luftwaffe. This attack killed 1352 personnel, including Admiral Carlo Bergamini, Chief of Naval Staff of the RN (RN).        Type 42 Air Defence Destroyer HMS Sheffield burned to the waterline after being hit by a single Aerospatiale AM39 Exocet ASCM launched by an Argentinian Super Etendard strike fighter. Twenty sailors were killed in this attack. The warhead failed to explode but residual propellant ignited an uncontrollable fire (  UK MoD image).                   Another Falklands Exocet casualty was the County Class Destroyer HMS Glamorgan, severely damaged with thirteen dead        (Anonymous).          Type 42 Air Defence Destroyer     HMS Coventry , sister ship to the Sheffield, capsized and sank after being hit by two 1,000 lb aerial bombs, with nineteen dead  (UK MoD images)    .      The Atlantic Conveyor burned  out after being hit by a single Aerospatiale AM39 Exocet ASCM launched by an Argentinian Super Etendard strike fighter. Twelve sailors were killed in this attack. It is unclear whether the warhead exploded or the damage was produced wholly by residual propellant igniting the ships flammable stores (UK MoD image).      Type 21 Frigate HMS Ardent burning after being hit by 1,000 lb aerial bombs, delivered by low flying Argentinian A-4 fighters. The Ardent sank. Twenty two sailors died in this attack   (unknown source, UK MoD images).      Type 21 Frigate HMS Antelope explodes and later sinks after being hit by 1,000 lb aerial bombs, also delivered by low flying Argentinian fighters. An Army bomb disposal expert and one sailor died in this attack (BBC, UK MoD images).        RFA Sir Galahad burns after being hit by three 1,000 lb bombs, delivered by Argentinian A-4 Skyhawks in dive attacks. This attack killed 48 personnel  (UK MoD image).              FFG7 Frigate USS Stark lists after being hit by a pair of Aerospatiale AM39 Exocet ASCMs, launched by an Iraqi Air Force Mirage F.1 strike fighter. Thirty seven sailors were killed in this attack (US DoD images).          The USS Liberty lists after being attacked by Israeli aircraft and torpedo boats in June 1967. Thirty four sailors were killed and many more injured (US Navy image).           Other Damage Imagery           The French oil tanker Limburg burns after a terrorist attack off the coast of Yemen in October, 2002. Oil tankers were frequently targeted during the Iran-Iraq war, repeating the Second World War experience where tankers in convoys were high priority targets for submarines and maritime strike aircraft (unknown image source).           Trials, Exercises and Sinkex Imagery        North Korean 4,000 tonne freighter Pong Su after taking two 2,000 lb Laser Guided Bomb hits, delivered by RAAF F-111C aircraft, 23rd March 2006. The Pong Su was siezed by Australian Federal Police in 2003, after a narcotics interdiction operation in Victoria which resulted in the capture of 150 kg of heroin, being smuggled by the North Koreans. The unseaworthy Pong Su was disposed of under Section 185(b) of the Customs Act 1901  (RAAF image).          During the Resultant Fury exercise conducted  late November, 2004, the US Air Force trialed the use of AMSTE-modified 2,000 lb JDAM guided bombs, with datalink updates from an E-8C JSTARS, and laser guided 2,000 lb GBU-10/BLU-109 bombs targeted by a Litening II pod on a B-52H.
