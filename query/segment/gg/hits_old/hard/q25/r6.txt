 AbsTracked: Feed Link of the Day - Automobile Recalls

     AbsTracked   A blog listing useful links. (Since this blog is from the perspective of an off-duty law librarian, links will generally be related to the topics of law, libraries, reference, technology, and fun.) *See disclaimer below.         Friday, April 29, 2005   Feed Link of the Day - Automobile Recalls   My Feed Link of the Day comes courtesy of  Robert Ambrogi's blawg . He posted today about AutoRecalls. You can get the feed for any recalls that have been issued for your car. Click on the make, then the model, then year of your vehicle and then click on the orange RSS button! How cool is that? The information is obtained from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration database.  Here's the link to all the feeds.
