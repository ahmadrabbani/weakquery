The recall is the most recent in a spate of quality problems for the number-one carmaker in the world. Today, Toyota announced that it will recall roughly 740,000 vehicles for repairs in the United States and 599,000 in Japan. The rest of the  recalled vehicles are in Europe and other global markets. In the past year, the Japanese automaker has recalled over ten million vehicles globally for a plethora of issues, from faulty brakes in the  Prius hybrid , to defective  accelerator pedals and  floor mats that can become wedged against gas pedals. In August of this year,  Toyota recalled 1.33 million  Corolla models and  Matrix vehicles in Canada and the United States due to the possibility of  engine stalling. Most of the recalled autos in this recall require repairs for an issue with the brake master cyclinder, which might attenuate braking strength, according to Paul Nolasco, a Tokyo spokesperson for Toyota. Certain vehicles in Japan and other markets, but not in the North American market, have an electrical issue with their fuel pumps, which might cause engine stalling, according to Nolasco. The company is not aware of any accidents resulting from the two problems, the spokesman said. Ryuichu Salto, a car analyst in Tokyo with Mizuho Investors Securities, reported that Toyota probably learned its lesson when it drew severe criticism earlier this year, especially in the United States, for failing to respond to safety problems and issue recalls promptly. U.S. regulators slapped Toyota Motor Corp. with a $16.4-million penalty for not alerting the government of its vehicle defects promptly. "Toyota's image suffered because it was slow and so it is trying to be quick with its response," said Saito. The carmaker has been attempting to revamp its quality controls and become more responsive to consumer complaints in the aftermath of its recall catastrophe. The vehicles impacted by the most recent recall in the United States include the 2005 and  2006 Avalon ; the 2004-2006 non-hybrid version of the  Highlander SUV; and the Lexus RX330, 2006 Lexus GS300,  IS250 , and  IS350 models, the automaker reported in a press release from its United States headquarters in Torrance, CA. The press release stated a minor amount of brake fluid might gradually leak from the brake master cylinder, causing the brake warning lamp to illuminate. Nolasco said Toyota will inform owners globally via mail to bring their vehicles to dealers for repair at no cost.
