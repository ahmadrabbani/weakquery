<p>In Pasadena, California, our client Jaklin was involved in a rear-end collision while stopped at an intersection. Jaklin's seat broke and collapsed backwards, allowing her body to submarine rearward underneath her seatbelt and shoulder restraint. Her head struck the back of the rear passenger seat, causing her to sustain severe injuries that permanently paralyzed her.  Our firm had the privilege of representing Jaklin in court, which resulted in a 24.7 million dollar verdict.</p>

<h2>Your To Do List After An Auto Defect Accident</h2>
<p>Anyone suffering an injury that was caused by a defective motor vehicle or a motor vehicle component would be well advised to preserve the vehicle since it's your evidence of a defect. You should also promptly consult with an auto products liability attorney who has the respect of the auto industry. Car manufacturers may be held responsible for any injuries or fatalities which are the result of a motor vehicle defect.  It is the responsibility of car manufacturers to make safe vehicles, free from defects and safety hazards that can injure vehicle occupants.</p>
