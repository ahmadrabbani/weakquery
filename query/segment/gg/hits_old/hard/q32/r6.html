Ground up rubber tires have been tested as soil amendments &amp surface mulches, &amp discovered to kill ornamental plants due to its zinc content; to be a fire hazard dangerous to place near buildings; &amp to smell incredibly bad.<br><br>

Often a single application is sufficient to kill plants. Nevertheless, more &amp more companies are obtaining crumb rubber waste product &amp packaging it in nicely designed bags that recommend it for gardens. Still other companies slip it into commercial composts as a bulking agent. The excuse for this is that rubber does have a slight (<i>very</i> slight) nitrogen value. But the toxicity from zinc, cadmium, &amp other heavy metals, more than makes up for any faint chance of a benefit.<br><br>

<a href="http://www.sare.org/sanet-mg/archives/html-home/18-html/0259.html"><i>Rufus Chaney</i></a> of the USDA Agricultural Research Service, analysing twenty years of research, concluded that the <i>majority</i> of research leads to the conclusion that for the Zinc factor alone, ground or chipped rubber should never be used in gardens or composts. Yet rubber remains an undisclosed ingredient in some commercially packaged composts, so that even a gardener who knows better than to dump rubber particles all over their garden may be doing so unknowingly.<br><br>

A gardener needs only consider the zinc factor &amp the stink factor to realize this is toxic garbage unsuitable for landscaping. But there are other heavy metal &amp toxic contaminants in crumb rubber, including arsenic, cadmium, lead &amp nickel, which can effect the safety of groundwater.<br><br>

The law does not require crumb rubber to be listed as "crumb rubber" when it is used as an ingredient in soil ammendment products; it can be listed as a bulking agent or some other imprecise reference intended to hide from you the fact that you just bought something with ground up rubber tires in it.<br><br>

As one might suspect, the attempt to find garden uses is inspired not by a desire to improve horticultural &amp agricultural techniques, but by a desperation to get rid of a type of trash that our culture generates by the billions of tons yearly, &amp which is difficult to discard. Political &amp economic pressures have been brought to bare even on horticultural research projects.<br><br>

 One might reasonably ask how ground-up rubber tires ever became legally marketed to dump in our gardens since it is known to kill plants. The sorry fact is, the governmental priority was finding a way to get rid of all those used tires. The thinking runs something like this:<br><br>

<ol>
<li> The foremost waste management problem in America was for decades this: what to do with used tires. One way or another this problem  <i>had</i> be taken care of.

<li> We're an automobile oriented society &amp whatever the answer to the problem may be, it must foremost be compatible with the requirements of automobile &amp tire manufacturers.

<li> If the tire industry were forced to spend money to clean up a problem their own industry causes, said industry would be annoyed &amp move to Indonesia. For a fee, millions upon millions of used tires have already been accepted in Malaysia &amp Thailand &amp the Philippines, enormous mountains of fire hazard waste rubber, &amp these countries would certainly welcome the manufacturers as well. So the solution must consider the necessity of keeping jobs &amp profits in America, even if that means polluting our own immediate environment as horrifically as is permitted in third-world countries.

<li> If the public could only be induced to purchase bags &amp bags of ground up rubber to disperse on their properties, this would be the ideal solution, for costly clean-up &amp disposal would be transformed into a source of industry profits rather than expense. 

<li> If the environment is harmed by the Final Solution, the harm has to be weighed against the positives of doing away with the waste while adding profit to industry coffers.

<li> Yes, this solution creates another environmental hazard. But even bad news can be worded to sound like good news.
</ol>

Hence governments <i>instructed</i> research facilities to find <i>some</i> useful value for used tires, rather than to assess the risks. The <i>appropritate</i> studies, it is further noted, will be fully funded by  the petroleum, chemical, &amp rubber industries themselves.<br><br>

 Therefore studies are set up specifically to find something good to say about this crud. For a single example of the inevitable response to the outlined factors, we find that the Northeast Recycle Council (NERC) has been fully coopted by the rubber industry, repeatedly recommending crumb rubber products as ecology-positive recycled goodness.<br><br>

 Under pretense of being a watchdog &amp research non-profit, rather than industry flunkies, NERC has been promoting all kinds of ideas profitable to the likes of the rubber industry. In their own minds they may or may not realize they are sell-outs, dupes, or frauds. The Council may well have convinced itself that the enormous problem of used tire waste <i>must</i> be solved in a profitable manner or it will never be solved at all  &#151;  &amp having first duped themselves, it is easier to dupe the public into believing toxic rubber mulch &amp compost filler is great stuff for everyone's gardens.<br><br>

 Hence when NERC promotes "buy recycled products!" the focus is on the word "Buy!" because profits is what they encourage, even at great expense to public health &amp well being. Where they recommend you spend your money can easily turn out to be harmful, &amp the recommended uses for the purchased item entirely inappropriate. But soft-touch ecologists are apt to do exactly as instructed when the word "recycled" is attached to a harmful product.<br><br>

Rufus Chaney is unambiguous about this:  "It may look like good money, but rubber-Zn will ruin the compost product."<br><br>

The game is stacked against the truth, &amp <i>some</i> value for this crud is being ballyhooed. The toxic factors are increasingly &amp intentionally <i>not</i> part of  studies; &amp even if a well-designed study has to admit that these products kill plants, that is shaped even by the researchers themselves to help industrial PR flacks transmogrify a negative finding into the wonderful proof that crumb rubber makes a great weed-suppressing mulch.<br><br>

Chemical toxic gasses ("volatile organic compounds" &amp "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons") are released from ground up synthetic rubber.  These volatile gasses are known to cause irritation of nasal &amp respiratory passages &amp can cause central nervous system damage, depression, nausea, dizziness, headaches, dermatitis, eye damage, &amp kidney damage.  The VOCs &amp PAHs  are sufficiently toxic that products with ground rubber should not be used in enclosed areas or indoors, such as indoor horse arenas where they are nevertheless recommended for use by vendors. In enclosed areas these hazards pose a human health hazard as well as to animals.<br><br>

This nevertheless gets dismissed because nobody was ever asphyxiated to death by these gasses, &amp really it is mainly a problem of <i>the hideous stench,</i> whether indoors or outdoors, especially on any hot day.<br><br>

Well hey, if it's mainly only the hideous stench, then all right, no problem!<br><br>

Industry can "spin" even the most horrendous finding &amp claim it is a good thing. AlternaMulch brand, like many others, <i>boasts</i> that this stuff won't break down in the environment in a <i>century.</i> (Contrary to widespread belief, rubber does decay when ground up for maximum exposure to funguses &amp microorganisms, but it does so at a very slow rate, after first leaching toxins into the soil.) <br><br>

Or, since the unembelished fact is:  "Zinc in crumb rubber toxifies soil with as few as one application; &amp with repeat application, eventually nothing will grow in that soil," smiling industry faces change it to, "The zinc content of rubber mulch &amp compost filler is beneficial to zinc deficient topsoils!" If the unembellished fact is: "Crumb rubber mulches &amp bulking agents kill flowers," the Industry version is that it "retards weeds."<br><br>

It is just amazing how easily <i>horrific facts</i> can be touted as plusses!<br><br>

The idea of crumb rubber in the garden has been around for 50 or more years &amp was initially a Cornell University research project seeking ways to use ground up tires for soil amendments. At that time the pressures were insufficient to concoct a complete lie. Since the findings showed conclusively that it was unsafe, very little came of those first field trials, although some use as unlabeled bulking agent did begin.<br><br>

 So the first serious commercial inroads for bags of avowed crumb rubber took decades to take hold. The first successful inroads were made by promoting crumb rubber as a playground mulch, on the premise that children who fell off playsets would bounce on the ground &amp be perfectly safe. With this use, the problem of the rubber killing ornamental plants could be ignored, even though playground rubber inevitably migrates into surrounding park gardens &amp lawns. <br><br>

But even in landscapes without plants to be killed, rubber mulch presents an extreme hazard on playgrounds. Field tests overseen by Larry Stewart at the Ohio State University Agricultural Technical Institute discovered rubber mulch to be a considerable fire hazard. This study compared many mulching materials &amp discovered: "All of the materials tested were different in their ease of ignition. Some, like cocoa hulls, never ignited under any of the circumstances, while others, like ground rubber, had flames within a minute &amp were a struggle to extinguish. It's rare that you would have a fire in mulch that is immediat. Most creep along under the mulch &amp then ignite, with rubber as an exception--it spreads fast and can't be contained. What's scary is that rubber's commonly used in playgrounds." A single flicked cigarette butt could be sufficient to turn a landscape or child's playground.<br><br>

Many of the numerous companies in this relatively new industry of selling rubber particles as mulch cite (as vaguely as they dare) a Pennsylvania State University study as though it lauded the product. But that study made <i>no</i> evaluation of the effects (good or bad) on gardens; it merely showed that if you fall down on rubber it hurts less than if you fall down on sticks or concrete or rocks. Well duh.<br><br>

Playground use of rubber mulch was never as safe as vendors pretend, even if only the fire hazard is weighed. But the reality has been that several researchers are concerned with the potential dermatological injury from contact with chemical components of ground rubber, which is a major health-hazard in the rubber manufacturing industry &amp likely to be a cause of dermatitis in children who fall &amp run &amp play in granulated rubber, which should not be touched except with Playtex or nitrile gloves.<br><br>

Despite the fire harzard that makes crumb rubber inappropriate even for playgrounds, nevertheless playground use was the foot-in-the-door that soon led to broader &amp broader recommendations for gardening options, with the zinc &amp heavy metals issue  conveniently mislaid.<br><br>

Rubber Resources of Florida under the brand name Everlast (great name  &#151;  admits you can never get this crud back out of the environment), &amp by YardCo (also of Florida) are just two examples of packagers who hope you'll be stupid enough to poison your landscape with their low-investment high-profit waste product. The product, they will imply, has been thoroughly tested (by themselves). A test garden in Hudson Florida called Garden World Nursery is owned by Rubber Resources &amp amounts to mere Display Propaganda posing as a study. Of course they're not actually claiming on their product label that rubber mulch has any actual value except for covering up the soil, so they're not quite lying about anything. But the clear implication, by showing the product strewn all around plants, is that it <i>is</i> recommendable to do just that.<br><br>

There's in particular an ongoing propagandistic attempt to convince organic gardeners that by participating in recycling of this kind, we are  good liberal nice people doing our part to save the world. But for the average gardener who puts poisons on their garden all the time anyway, that market is already sewn up.<br><br>

 YardCo promises their cedar-colored rubber particles are "95% steel free!"  Most such products are mum on the topic of steel content, &amp don't even make the laughable boast that their product is 5% metal particles. Bits of radial tire steel in the garden is obviously a negative factor. As much as possible, the steel that is in used tires is removed to recycle into new steel products, as steel is the only legitimately recylcable component of tires. Once the majority of the steel is removed, what remains is toxic waste that most certainly shouldn't be used in landscaping. The rubber itself cannot be recycled into new rubber, which is why novel &amp dangerous uses have been concocted.<br><br>

For every 5,000 pounds of tires recycled, about 2,000 pounds of steel is recovered first, &amp another 2,000 pounds of shredded rubber goes to the "rubber mulch" industry. The remaining 1,000 pounds is primarily the rubber-to-steel bonding agent. Most of that goes to landfill though a very small amount goes to the manufacture of tiles &amp architectural molding. It has many of the same environmental problems as are outlined in the companion essay on <a href="http://www.paghat.com/polymers.html"><i>Deadly Polymers in the Garden.</i></a> So a percentage of harmful steel, &amp another percentage harmful bonding agent, does remain in the shredded rubber when sold for gardening purposes.<br><br>

One brand of rubber mulch claims to have no steel at all, but nothing requires them to prove it, &amp the companies that sell this stuff are mainly just buyers on the open market for pulverized rubber left over from higher in the recycling pecking order. None of the companies even mention the lingering percentage of latex or urethane bonding agent in the pulverized rubber, about which they can do nothing by the time they have obtained it as crumb rubber.<br><br>

The University of Arkansas did some testing to see if, within a limited value as a sterile mulch, crumb rubber could be categorically declared to be harmless. Drawing paramaters specifically designed to insure positive findings, U.A. indeed "proved" that rubber mulch does not harm plants if used in places where there are no plants to begin with! How could research paramaters become so moronic? In this case, the Horticultural department at the University of Arkansas <i>was  specifically hired by Davis Rubber Company</i> so any posturing as an independent study merely compounds the lie.<br><br>

 University of Florida also took funding from Florida rubber mulch manufacturers to "prove" something positive about the product. Whimsically their "best" spin in the products' favor was that it was good for permanent landscape features where a landscaper wanted nothing to grow. Even at that they recommended it be mixed with gravel to limit this lightweight crud's migration into areas where it could cause harm.<br><br>

It's no accident that Florida, the Carolinas, &amp Arkansas are the places where this stuff first gained "popularity" or was first marketed successfully, as that is the part of the USA populated by nine-fingered chicken factory workers &amp where open cesspools of pigshit are seasonally flooded into watersheds by hurricanes &amp where once-beautiful  hills &amp valleys have been leveled by coal stripmining companies. Universal concessions to <i>anything</i> Industry demands has never benefited citizens of the South, but it has lined the pockets of politicians.<br><br>

Waste Management Acts in southern states dealing with used tires were the first to encourage novel &amp creative uses of crumb rubber without regard for the dangers. The southern states even provided the first markets for the dubious products, to whit:<br><br>

South Carolina's Three Rivers Solid Waste Authority was the first major client for rubber waste dumped over great areas of land at highway rest stops. The S.C. Department of Health &amp Environmental Control's Office of Solid Waste Reduction &amp Recycling put their own PR department to work promoting a potentially harmful waste product as the Ultimate Solution to the problem of used tire disposal.<br><br>

When Rubber Barons can get local government officials to spew their propaganda for them, how much nicer it all works out for the Rubber Barons.<br><br>

A three year slipshod "study" in South Carolina was an amazing white-wash job. The primary "plus" finding was that county &amp state laborers &amp groundkeepers liked the stuff because it lessened the amount of work they had to do, since rubber never leaves the environment the way organic mulches do &amp doesn't need re-applications. This is a little like giving a clean bill of health to Sterno as a food product because some hobos said it was good to drink.<br><br>

 Although the PR spin was that "no problems were reported," the study actually did note (framing it as an unimportant aside) that rubber mulch <i>killed all the flowers in summer.</i> All of them! The study further noted that the rubber mulch smelled bad on hot days (failing, however, to note that the fumes are toxic). But the primary conclusions made the important factors for the continued use of rubber mulch these:  1) Its permanency in the environment; 2) It keeps its color; &amp 3) some rest-stop laborers were glad they didn't have to mulch as often.<br><br>

 When studies are arranged to assess how long it lasts without fading, rather than how it harms the environment, really great things can be said about rubber mulch!<br><br>

South Carolina's waste management agency next went out of its way to promote the product in other states &amp spread the project to kill the flowers &amp stink up the rest stops all across the continent. They already had their own state's waste tires ready to ship! Woohoo!<br><br>

The South Carolina study also admitted that producing this stuff <i>is one of the most expensive uses of public funds.</i> But was that a negative? Certainly not! It was no big deal because the state government could charge every tire buyer a special tax on every tire sold in the state to underwrite recycling. Rubber mulch is good because it raises taxes? Sheesh; &amp politicians wonder why they're despised.<br><br>

So the industry coopted to their point of view such diverse folks as child safety people (because rubber mulch under Lollypop Land swing sets made falling down a trampoline act); government waste management people (who'd long ago taken on what should've been the industry's responsibility to get rid of waste tires), recycle environmentalists (who'd buy candybars made out of deep fried dogshit if it said "recycled" on it), as well as sleezier sorts of smaller business opportunists informed that it was legal for them to cheaply obtain a toxic waste product to repackage for sale to gullible gardeners.<br><br>

 When the Arkansas Attorney General <i>recommended</i> rubber mulch for state playgrounds &amp parks, it was because Davis Rubber was a local employer. When a government department or University study is <i>not</i> bought &amp paid for by the industry, the condemnation of rubber being strewn into the gardening environment is entirely clear (as it is clear from Ellen Harrison's research at Cornell University Waste Management Institute). The industry generates its own "alternate" studies then promotes only those.<br><br>

 The rubber industry greased the palms of many activist organizations &amp university departments to focus on finding values &amp stop condemning the stuff for its negative effects. Richard Evans of the Horticultural Extension of Davis University in California put the best spin he could on his study of potting soils made with crumb rubber. All glowy-eyed in one interview he said how really well the chrysanthemums grew in this potting medium, saying: "It works pretty well. It has some nice properties."<br><br>

 Pressed for details, he less happily admitted,  "The only problem was, the zinc content began to kill the chrysanthemums." It took <i>one week</i> for the plants to show evidence of toxification &amp browning leaves. And that wasn't even with repeat use  &#151;  just one good dose of crumb rubber &amp kaput.<br><br>

 How could he interpret a crumb rubber planting medium that kills the plants as in any way "a nice property" for the product? Check out how much funding scattered throughout the University of California system comes just from Goodyear Tire &amp Rubber.  Davis University in particular is looking to hire more lab technicians with, to quote from their own employment opportunity webpage,  "Demonstrated experience &amp knowledge of nylon, acrylic, polypropane, polystyrene, natural rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, acrylic-butadiene rubber" &amp so on. These are the growing areas of research that can be fully funded by industrial grant-monies. Slowly it becomes clear how rapid decline of plant health might be found to be "a nice property" for crumb rubber.<br><br>

Government &amp university assistance to the rubber industry is even more absurd in some other countries. In Malaysia all government rubber policies are oriented toward benefiting the sizeable rubber industry, which has resulted in a considerable problem of waste tires.  For some while this fuel was even used by bakeries, until the public balked at rubber-flavored breads &amp pastries.<br><br>

 The Malay government had encouraged through funding research on what to do about the growing problem of rubber waste, resulting in the the public being encouraged to buy &amp use a recycled rubber fuel which fouled the atmosphere. Just as for the American promotion of toxic rubber mulches for the garden, Malaysia too found a use for old tires with the same underlying philosophy that the environment does not count, even the quality of the food we eat does not count. All that matters is solving a waste management problem in a way that profits rather than taxes industry.<br><br>

Easy inroads have also been made in Argentina, where crumb rubber is presently being touted as a "natural" or "organic" fertilizer. That can be made to sound like a reasonable claim since rubber is presumedly a tree product to start with. This conveniently overlooks the fact that tires have not been manufactured from pure rubber for decades.<br><br>

Much more recently a reasonable use for rubber tires <i>was</i> developed in the United States: as a fuel to generate electricity, replacing coal, in special electrical plants using special scrubbers to keep the pollutants out of the atmosphere.  A few such plants could take care of the rubber waste problem profitably &amp with minimal harm to the environment. But as it turns out, the price-value of rubber as an electricity-generating fuel is a tiny fraction of its highly inflated price when sold to public to smear on gardens. State of the art electrical generators cannot compete on the open market for waste rubber, not now that sleezy small businesses have gotten so well established. It  remains more profitable to hoodwink citizens into poisoning their gardens.<br><br>

The <i>real</i> answer is to formulate &amp manufacture tires in such a manner that they are recyclable into making new tires out of old. As presently formulated this is impossible, &amp neither the oil tycoons nor the rubber barons want this to change because it is vastly more profitable to keep providing new raw materials.<br><br>

Crumb rubber factories are being opened in almost every state of the union because the government has accepted this as the best answer to a solid waste problem with economic side-benefits. Many a so-called "environmental" project  can be turned into an opportunity to spread out more crumb rubber. It's now being used in wetlands "restoration" projects for example. Vast amounts of tire waste are being dumped into wetlands despite studies that show it only takes one week to start killing native plants.<br><br> 

The best we can hope for is that organic gardening will become so widespread that the governmental &amp industrial desire to dupe us one &amp all, merely to sell us stuff with which to injure the environment, will in the long run fail. So far, alas, it looks like they're having a rousing success getting gardeners to do their dirty work.<br><br>

<span style="font-size: 80%;">
The above article was first published on-line in 2000, with periodic up-dates that caused it to get longer &amp longer. When first posted, a google search would get a seeker hundreds of vendor-generated articles &amp virtually nothing factual about its deadly Zn toxicity to plants, the disgusting odor that would ruin anyone's pleasure in its vicinity, &amp the fire hazard rubber mulch constitutes. Today, however, there is increasing information all over the web, &amp the news is slowly getting out, though the weight of vendor misinformation still exceeds the availability of factual information.<br><br>

The article still generates more letters of comment than any other single piece at paghat.com.   The most common &amp most tragic letters are from people who found out too late how awful this stuff smells &amp how it killed their plants, &amp how difficult &amp expensive to reverse the error &amp get this crud out of their landscapes.<br><br>

Once I got a letter from a vendor threatening me for ruining his business, stating that if I didn't immediately remove the article from the web, he would sue me. I gave him my name &amp home address &amp invited him to start legal procedings at once, as I would enjoy owning his house when all was said &amp done. I never heard from that puling garden-killer again.<br><br>

Individuals who have had their gardens destroyed by this stuff have been taking landscapers to small claims court, &amp I'm often asked for further citations so that good scientific data could be presented to the judge. Some of the articles I read for the original article circa 1999 I did not keep copies of, &amp don't want to go back into the library just to compile a more complete list of citations (I attempted to cite, within the article, enough for anyone with deeper interest to track down my sources in any good science library).
