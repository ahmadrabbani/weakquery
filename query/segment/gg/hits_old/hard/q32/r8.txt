There is a business opportunity up for grabs and it’s in recycling them.  With more than 33 million vehicles added to the Indian roads in last three years, can you guess the other items that would have increased manifold leading to some grave problems? Well, one of them is the tyre, one of man’s most useful inventions. Most useful, but if the increasing numbers are not managed it can be dangerous. About 80 million tyres are a part of these 33 million vehicles, which include two, three, four and six wheelers, and pose a potential threat to the environment. However, companies have innovated ways and means to curb this menace which has led to the evolution of the huge tyre recycling industry. When we had started working on this article, we thought we could count the recycled tyre uses on our fingers; which included cushioning on boats, burning for warmth in winter, swing ride seats (in rural Indian context) and at the most land-filling. However, further research and talking to industry people revealed startling facts about the uses of old tyres, which we had never imagined. In fact, in India, even the tyre recycling industry is not aware of all these uses. It’s a business opportunity glaring in front of us.  In this article we have tried to find out the ground realities of the tyre recycling industry and we have also taken inputs from Dr. S N Chakravarty, KPS Consultants & Impex who is a consultant in tyre, rubber and allied industries with 40 years of experience.  Tyre composition and stages in recycling  A tyre is made of natural rubber (also called virgin rubber), Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR), Polybutadiene Rubber (PBR), Carbon black, Nylon tyre cord, rubber chemicals, steel tyre cord and Butyl rubber. Stages in Recycling: Crumb: Rubber Crumb is the material resulting from granulating scrap tyres into uniform rubber granules. It can be mixed with asphalt for road surfacing and making children’s playgrounds Reclaimed Rubber: Reclaimed Rubber is the recycled old tyre rubber. It can be used as a substitute of natural & synthetic rubber. It is mixed with virgin rubber to further make new tyres of automobiles, bicycles and other low-cost products like footwear and mats. Virgin rubber, 90 percent of which is produced in Kerala is sold for as high Rs 140-150 per kg. Reclaimed rubber is sold for Rs 25-30 per kg and India being one of the voluminous reclaim rubber producers, the production is growing by ten percent per year.  Size of the business opportunity  A typical passenger car tyre contains 24-28 percent of Carbon black, 40-48 percent of natural rubber (NR) and 36-24 percent of synthetic rubber including Styrene Butadiene Rubbers (SBR) and Butyl Rubber (BR). These need to be recovered back from tyres lest they are wasted away. Currently, India produces 90,000 metric tonnes (MT) of reclaimed rubber, which is sold at Rs 25-30/kg but does not produce Carbon black, Butyl Rubber and oil from used tyres. Now the Indian tyre industry (specifically) imported 39,000 tonnes of Carbon black and 54 percent of its Butyl Rubber requirements in 2008-09. If we could produce even a small amount of that import ourselves, we would be saving a huge amount for the exchequer. Current tyre production stands at 11.75 lakh MT for the year 2008-09. With the projected growth of 50 percent, you can easily estimate the potential of the opportunity. Present scenario  Even though it’s a 40 year old industry in India with the oldest player being Gujarat Reclaim, the number of players nationally is very small, approx 15-25 tyre recyclers in India, compared to 36 tyre manufacturers. The major players number only about four or five. They are mainly located in North India and Maharashtra. Prominent names include Gujarat Reclaim, ELGI Group, Balaji Group, Rishiroop and Swani. Gujarat Reclaim has an annual turnover of over Rs 15 crore from its Haridwar tyre recycling plant, with a production of 20 tonnes of reclaim rubber per day. However, none of the recyclers in India are full-fledged recyclers, and most of them use the Pan method for reclaiming rubber. They operate by outsourcing part of their work to each other. Various Uses of Old Tyres  Excluding the use of whole tyres, we can categorize the uses of tyres in the following way: 1. Rubber Crumb - floor mats, belts, gaskets, shoe soles, dock bumpers, seals, muffler hangers, shims, and washers 2. Reclaimed Rubber in Vehicles: a) Automotive Industry - Crumb (three to five percent) and Reclaimed rubber (up to ten percent) is particularly used in automobile tyres. However, since the volume of tyres is very high, the quantity of these rubbers used also goes up. New tyre industry uses approximately 58 percent of the natural rubber of India, including imports of more than 80000 tonnes (according to ATMA figures) b) In tyre carcasses in substantial volume and other automotive parts c) Bicycle tyre industry produces a massive 6-7 lakh tyres/day, out of which more than 80 percent are produced in Ludhiana. Ralson is the major company here with a production of one lakh bicycle tyres a day and 1.5 lakh tubes a day. 3. Molded products – These include mats, hose pipes, conveyor belts, v-belts, footwear, tiles, adhesives, sound dampers, rubber sheets, battery containers and other rubber molded goods 4. Footwear industry - Shoe soles 5. Cement Industry - "This is the most perverse use of old tyres causing only pollution", says Dr. Chakravarty . However, in some countries, respective cement industries have developed technology where the tyre is burnt at a temperature that destroys most toxic emissions, the exhaust is scrubbed and filtered and little escapes the cement kiln. The usage of tyres for burning in cement kilns in India is up to 20000 tonnes per year, according to Imbrose, a small tyre trader. 6. Retreading – Tyres in India are retreaded as much as three to six times. One thing to note here is that it’s the truck tyres that are retreaded, and not the car tyres. There are 100-odd firms engaged in tyre retreading in India with prominent names being MRF, Apollo, ELGI, Midas and Indag. 7. Whole tyres are used as highway crash barriers, furniture, boat bumpers on marine docks, etc but it is a negligible amount. Land filling or burning tyres for energy has limited prospects as environmental authorities are acknowledging the need for its greener alternatives. On the other hand, mass-market end products like continuous rolls of cost-effective recycled rubber used for noise insulation now complete the 'big picture' for investors to consider recycling tyres commercially.  Where to procure old tyres?  Old tyres are procured from tyre dealers across the country and tyre associations. The market is concentrated in the trucking centers of India. What technology is available?  There are three methods for reclaiming rubber: 1. Pan Method – It is the oldest and highly labor-intensive and causes huge water and air pollution. 2. Digestor Method – It is a costlier method and used by some recyclers in India. 3. Reclamation Methods – It is a very costly method and is only used for very large-scale production. None of the Indian firms use this methodThe minuter processes include mechanical shredding, mixing, pressing, pyrolysis, etc. Would I be making money through this or saving the environment?  The attraction factor towards environment can be served if better technology and systems are used which would reduce pollution. Besides, there would be huge savings on oil imports. The existing companies are surely making money with a profit margin of 10-15 percent. If the issues of energy cost, collection of scrap tyre and various clearances required for environmental pollution can be handled, money will follow and flow in. Can I import used tyres?  "Despite the ban on import, used tyres are imported in a clandestine manner, sometimes as new tyres at low value; since there is no restriction on import of new tyres or as tyres under the "others" category. Many countries such as Japan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, Kenya, South Korea, etc. have either put a complete ban on import of used tyres or have placed stringent conditions on such imports", says Sundarrajan of PrimaryInfo. Chinese tyres whch are as cheap as 30% to Indian tyres dominate the market in spite of the anti-dumping rules. How big can the industry grow?  With the right initiatives taken by the government, there is a possibility of 50-100 percent growth of this industry including export options (of the good quality reclaimed rubber). India is currently the second largest reclaim rubber producer after China. Statistics project a mammoth potential increase upwards of Rs1.13 billion in the industry. Countries in Middle East, Africa, Europe and other Asian countries form the export market. Investment required  For the Pan method recycling, the plant can be set up with Rs1 crore. However, a plant of Digestor method recycling, producing 5 MT/day shall cost Rs 3-10 crore depending upon the source of the machines and level of automation. A fully automated plant would cost about Rs12 crore. Reclamation method is not used by anyone in India. No reports or data?  The rubber bodies must commission a proper study to gauge the current scenario and potential of tyre recycling industry by involving technical experts. The Rubber Board, which is a cash rich organization, can offer incentives of various kinds to the recyclers to start and expand the business and start exporting. Starting Up  So, now if you want to start up a tyre recycling industry, you need to buy a tyre recycling plant with judicious combination of machinery from India and China for effective investment control, conduct feasibility studies and market survey, and then make sure that both the supply of old tyres is controlled and sale of by-products is maintained continuously. Regarding things to be careful about, Kumar says "Entrepreneurs should focus on quality product, selection of suitable machinery, cost-effective capacity choosing and environment protection, all of which are very important." In UK, The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has launched an initiative to encourage businesses to recycle more tyres. It is estimated that 100,000 used tyres are removed from UK’s vehicles each day, amounting to 40,000 tonnes of waste rubber each year. Under the scheme, the EPA and the Waste and Resources Action Program(WRAP) plan to create guidelines for the collection, transportation, storage, recycling and reuse of the rubber tyres.

Take a look at the websites of the companies on this list, some good info there. In Europe, see a company called Genan as an example of a modern tire recycler. These are good models for anyone planning a large tire recycling company.  http://www.recyclingtoday.com/more-than-crumbs-recycling-today-december-2010.aspx   report abuse vote down vote up Votes:  +0      Business Development written by  Anthony , February 19, 2011  From my research, there are only a few long established companies (that I'm aware of) that can manufacture a full tire crumbing plant, from shredding to fine powder granulation and cleaning system. Granulation (or crumbing) is where you want to be and where the real value is from End of Life Tires (ELTs). The World Business Council for Sustainable Development has put together some very good information regarding ELT management.  http://www.wbcsd.org/Plugins/DocSearch/details.asp?DocTypeId=251&ObjectId=Mzg0NzQ  For some companies that can provide you a full turn key plant, See CM Tire Recycling, Eldan Recycling and Granutech. I've also recently heard good things about a German company, Pallmann. There are many other companies selling equipment. You'll find them on Alibaba and Trademart. It's a good idea to tour their plants and talk to people that have had to live with the equipment for at least several years. The machines will need repair, regular servicing and access to parts. You might save up front on the cheaper equipment however if you want to build up a serious recycling business in what will be one of the biggest markets, you should go with the best service and partner for your equipment.   report abuse vote down vote up Votes:  +0      ... written by chirag savaliya, February 19, 2011  Dear sir,  I want to start this business so please send us quotation on my mail  Thanking you  Mr. Chirag patel  Email.  chirag_savaliya43@yahoo.com  report abuse vote down vote up Votes:  +0      ... written by ashu khandelwal, February 18, 2011  Hello sir...thakyou for dis imp. information..I might be interested in joining hands and resources for the tyre recycling unit.

We are looking for Asian crumb producers capable of producing 2500 mt per month of 40 mesh crumb rubber (.42mm) from pure truck or pure passenger car tires - but not mixed. Having control over the sorting of tires pre shredding is required as this material will be converted into premium compound (not reclaim). Car tires contain more synthetic rubber whereas truck tires have a higher natural rubber content. Both are valuable in their respective applications.

The major issue is that all need to be careful as to how you will acquire the raw material, in this case the waste tyre for processing. We have been actively pursuing the Government to allocate permissions to medium scale processing industry as well as the cement industry in the country, who can specifically ensure,record and certify the ultimate usage of the raw material, be allowed to import the required quantities. In addition, it is of utmost importance that investors understand that in cases where the raw material is restricted (India manufacturers approx. 97 million tyres)and no dumping is available, any investment will be met with restricted growth. We are available for any further queries too on  yash.oorja@gmail.com.

I am a Brazilian student of the Rio de Janeiro's Federal University and I am doing a research about used tyre, management and disposal. My study will contemplate several countries, India among them. Unfortunatelly, I haven't found so far any document about how is this network structured in India. I would really aprecciate your effort if you could clarify these subjects for me.  Does the Indian government have any rules about how should tyres be collected, or does the government itself collect them from somewhere? Is there any regulation or something related about how tyres should be disposed? Or, is the tyre collection made by some specific companies which supply the tyre recycling industry?  Thank you all in advance.

Chakravarty , April 17, 2010  Hi Ritvik  Recycling ( Reclaimed rubber ) of scrap automotive tyres is a feasible business proposition. Reclaimed rubber is used in a wide variety of application like auto tyres, bicycle tyres , automotive components, shoe industry , conveyor belt , tiles & flooring etc. etc.  In India , no scrap of any kind is thrown but collected and there are agents who organise such scrap collection and delivery to different industry. Hence, approaching this channel one can organise the scrap tyre for the production of reclaim rubber. Scrap tyre is not burned in the house hold but in certain industry, especially cement industry. There are a number of reclaim rubber manufacturing units in India working with profit producing about 100,000 tons per annum. The growth of reclaim rubber consumption is strong giving scope for additional units.  You could contact us directly in future.  Besides, any party interested in setting up such plant may contact us directly.  Thanking you,  Dr. S.N.

A whole range of products can be developed from rubber crumb inclung non slip flooring, waterproofing and sealants, automobile parts, bicycle tyres, machinery parts like rollers, gaskets etc. In a way a very very flexible customer list!!!  The biggest constraint however in DOING THE BUSINESS IN INDIA is that unlike Europe and US, we do not have mass scale tyre landfills from where to lift the tyres(our raw material). Mostly tyres are burnt for rural household and industrial fuel in India as against collection for recycling. It may not be economical to have collection centres acoss the country to collect and cart them to one central processing unit.  However, in case the tyre recycling business qualifies for carbon credits, it might be worth looking into.  I invite comments and views from Dr.S.N.Chakravarty and others.   report abuse vote down vote up Votes:  +1      Further Information written by  Dr. S.N.
