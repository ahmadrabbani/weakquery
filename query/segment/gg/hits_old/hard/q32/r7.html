    <p>
      Remains of human settlements through the ages are characterized by
      garbage. Early human encampments are surrounded by discarded bones,
      shells, and broken tools and weapons. While such material is a boon to
      archaeologists, the mountains of discarded materials produced by
      today&#x0027;s society threaten to consume available land near large
      cities, and they pollute the water supplies of both rural and urban
      environments. Nearly every object and material discarded by humans can be
      recycled, reducing the cost and danger of disposal and providing valuable
      resources for industry and the home. Recycling also restricts many
      dangerous substances to facilities designed to handle them.
    </p>
    <h2>
      The Emergence of Recycling
    </h2>
    <p>
      Many Americans remember when garbage disposal was as simple as placing the
      material in a can in the alley or, in the case of rural residents, feeding
      the pig, or tossing everything into a nearby ditch in the name, at least,
      of erosion control. Our ancestors lived lives much simpler and were much
      less encumbered by material possessions. Bottles, buttons, nails, and wood
      all passed through a progression of steps and were smelted, rewoven,
      reshaped, or burned. Few people anywhere lived in societies where many
      materials were simply thrown away. The largest furniture store now
      operating in the United States was founded by two immigrants who began
      their careers as rag and bottle pickers during the early 1900s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every bottle or jar in early America was recycled, and pieces were used
      for purposes as varied as arrowheads and grit for chickens. Birds, lacking
      teeth, must collect small rocks, or grit, in order to grind their food in
      the craw. Old-time farmers sometimes ground glass when oyster shell or
      other sources of grit were unavailable. Ground glass was also mixed with
      glue to make abrasives. The vast numbers of buffalo killed by Native
      American or European hunters left huge quantities of bones on the prairie,
      but early scavengers collected them and shipped them to plants where they
      were ground for fertilizer. Early-day cloth was collected and treated to
      reclaim fiber, which could be woven into string or rope. Most cities
      contain parks, and below many of these parks are landfills dating back as
      far as the 1800s. A lack of landfill space, increasing transportation
      costs, and tougher government regulations now diminish the use of
      landfills, and many smaller communities sport signboards denouncing the
      importation of waste from other cities or states.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recycling falls into two categories: direct and indirect. Direct recycling
      is the reuse of components of manufactured materials before sale, often in
      the case of damaged or unsold products. Indirect recycling is the practice
      of recycling products or materials that consumers have used and discarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortages during World War I and World War II prompted scrap iron, fiber,
      and rubber drives, reclaiming many essential materials. The first items to
      be recycled through organized programs other than in wartime were milk and
      other beverage bottles. In days when milkmen placed bottles on doorsteps,
      the heavy bottles were returned, washed, and refilled dozens of times.
      During the 1940s and 1950s, families scavenged for soda and beer bottles
      and cans along highways, and many children supplemented or earned
       allowances by collecting bottles for the two-cent deposit. Plastic
      bottles and aluminum cans have largely replaced the reusable bottles of
      the twentieth century. Many states now mandate five- to ten-cent deposits
      on the plastic replacements. The scrap material drives of the World Wars
      brought the public&#x0027;s attention to the fact that many more fabrics,
      metals, and rubber items could be recycled.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Water
    </h2>
    <p>
      The most commonly recycled material is water. Seldom destroyed in use,
      water serves as a medium for chemical reactions and as a heat transfer
      mechanism in steam or hot water systems, car engines, and various
      industrial processes. Moderately dirty water may be dumped directly into
      streams, injected into wells, or, in the case of cooling water from power
      plants, allowed to pass through wetlands to cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Water containing sewage is given primary treatment consisting of settling
      and filtration and secondary aeration treatment to allow oxidative
      bacteria to reduce the bacterial oxidative demand (BOD). Tertiary
      treatment with chlorine, chloramines, or ozone is used if the water is
      needed for consumption. In rural areas, sewage may pass through a cesspool
      for sedimentation and anaerobic bacterial action, and the effluent may be
      distributed through a series of pipes into a disposal field. Water that
      has low BOD is usually purified by bacterial action in soil so that after
      passing some distance through the ground, biodegradable substances are
      removed. It is particularly important that detergents be biodegradable and
      contain minimal amounts of phosphates and nitrates, as these substances,
      along with high BOD water, contribute to eutrophication, a rapid growth of
      bacteria. Eutrophication may consume so much available oxygen that fish
      and other organisms die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farms, ranches, and feedlots provide food but often are major sources of
      pollution. Modern feedlots store sewage in lagoons where solids can be
      collected. Effluent water from lagoons often contains microorganisms that
      serve as food in fish farms, and solids from the lagoons can be processed
      into fertilizer. The effectiveness of these operations is often determined
      by the size of the operation and the need for cleanup. Larger operations
      can afford more complex remediation equipment and tend to be more
      costeffective than small ones. Most large feedlots are located away from
      population centers whose residents often complain of the odors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Federal, state, and municipal laws mandate that industries reclaim most
      pollutants, such as 
      <b>
        heavy metals
      </b>
       or organic chemicals, from wastewater. Prior to this legislation, toxic
      chemicals often made their way into the water table. Reclaiming toxic
      substances protects the environment and, in many cases, provides a
      valuable source of materials needed for 
      <b>
        synthesis
      </b>
      . In many cases, industries are located near other manufacturing plants
      that pass their waste to another plant, which uses it as a raw material.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Paper, Steel, and Aluminum
    </h2>
    <p>
      Paper, in the form of used newspapers, packing materials, and telephone
      books, may be burned for energy, but it still makes up 30 percent to 45
      percent of the average landfill. Landfilled paper requires decades to
      decay and
       may release methane, a greenhouse gas that is twenty times as deleterious
      as carbon dioxide. Most paper could be reused or converted to materials
      used for blown insulation. Nearly 40 percent of office paper and
      newspapers is now recycled. Two problems occur in recycling paper. Each
      time paper is reprocessed, the fibers break and become shorter. Office
      copiers work best with long-fiber paper that has higher tensile strength
      and produces less dust. Fiber from used paper is often blended with new
      fibers to produce the desired qualities. A second problem in recycling
      office paper is the demand for white paper. Used paper pulp often contains
      ink or other colored materials that must be removed. Some inks and
      adhesives can be removed by flotation, and bleaching then whitens the
      pulp. Older methods of chlorine bleaching produced toxic dioxin. Oxygen
      and hydrogen peroxide are now used to whiten paper and are considered less
      damaging to the environment. Use of colored papers for printing and
      copying greatly decreases the need for bleaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steel is widely recycled. Soon after steel was first produced, damaged
      steel items were recycled into new products. Today, 68 percent of used
      steel is recycled. The basic oxygen process of steel manufacture uses 25
      percent scrap as starting material, and nearly 100 percent of the starting
      material for steel production by the electric arc process is scrap. Many
      states have &#x0022;clunker&#x0022; laws that require that the purchase of
      a new car be accompanied by turning in a junked car, and most
      municipalities have programs for collecting and recycling used auto parts
      and furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aluminum is one of the most commonly recycled metals. Although many
      aluminum products are still discarded, 65 percent of aluminum materials
      are recycled; 95 percent less energy is needed to produce aluminum from
      recycled cans than from aluminum ore.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Plastics and Oil
    </h2>
    <p>
      Plastics make up only about 8 percent of the volume in the average
      landfill but represent a huge investment of energy and raw materials. Most
      plastics produced from petroleum materials by polymerization of monomers
      such as ethylene or vinyl chloride are thermoplastic materials and can be
      cleaned, melted, and re-formed. Thermosetting plastics can also be cut
      into pieces that are mixed with other plastics or used as fillers.
      High-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) are
      the most widely reused plastic materials, but polyvinyl chloride (PVC),
      polypropylene, and polystyrene account for 5 percent of the recycled
      plastics. In 2001 80 million pounds (36 million kilograms) of plastics
      were recycled in the United States. Recycled plastic materials are used in
      the production of bottles, fabrics, flowerpots, furniture, plastic lumber,
      injection molded crates, and automobile parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Americans discard 120
      million gallons (454 million liters) of oil each year as a result of
      automobile oil changes. Virtually all this oil can be recycled, and most
      states require recycling. Used motor oil contains particulate matter and
      some chemical substances that must be removed during re-refining. As much
      as 80 percent of used motor oil is used with little change as a fuel for
      ships or industrial heating equipment, but this practice probably poses a
      greater danger to the environment than burning refined oil.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Batteries, Rubber, and Paint
    </h2>
    <p>
      Used lead-acid automobile batteries represent a major hazard to the
      environment. Most landfills accept batteries but place them aside for
      recycling, which includes collecting and neutralizing the acid, removing
      the cases, and resmelting the lead plates. Fragments of cases can be
      recycled into new battery cases, and resmelted lead is used to cast new
      battery plates. In New Zealand alone, 500,000 lead-acid storage batteries
      are recycled each year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rechargeable batteries from power tools, telephones, and most other
      devices can be recycled. Nonrecyclable batteries often contain mercury or
      other toxic metals that are harmful to the environment, but in the early
      twenty-first century, most were still discarded in landfills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rubber products pose a special problem in the environment, and their
      dumping in landfills usually requires a special fee. Discarded in piles or
      buried, they occasionally catch fire and produce noxious gases. In
      developing countries, many used or damaged automobile tires are repaired
      or disassembled to make other products. Granulated rubber produced from

          Utility District sells the freon to DuPont, drains the oil from the
          refrigerators, and sells the scrap metal.

      discarded tires can be used to make floor mats and rubber wheels, and it
      can be used as a component of asphalt-paving materials. Used rubber can be
      heated to reclaim petroleum products, treated chemically to obtain
      components used as filler in manufacturing rubber products, or incinerated
      as a source of energy.

      Many recyclable materials consist of mixed materials that pose special
      problems. Discarded automobile oil filters contain steel, fiber, and
      contaminated petroleum. Oil filters are crushed and heated to remove oil,
      and the metal reclaimed. Discarded household appliances contain large
      amounts of steel but must often be dismantled, with other materials
      removed. A special fee is charged at recycling centers to discard most
      appliances. Fluorescent lamps contain small amounts of mercury that can be
      reclaimed. Used computers and television sets contain usable materials
      and, often, some toxic materials that can be collected for safe disposal.

      The small amounts of paint generated by the average household cannot be
      recycled economically, but most municipalities sponsor paint exchange
      programs and collect oil-based paints. Spent fuel rods from nuclear power
      plants can be recycled to reclaim unused uranium, and some spent uranium
      is used to produce armor-piercing bullets. Yard waste from households is
      often recycled and made into mulch for farming and gardening. Discarded
      Christmas trees are used to form mulch or are immersed in lakes as a
      habitat for fish.

think may be the percentage of recycled paper now IS NOT YET 40.
