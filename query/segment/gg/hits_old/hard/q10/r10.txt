However, the word "abuse" stuck in my mind. (that's Mom to right) During a heated argument, Bob, my husband screamed at me, "You're trying to control me!" and my AA sponsor agreed with him. That confused me because he was the control freak in the marriage."  “You are trying to get him to love you, Shelly,” Mary explained. “You don’t understand what your boundaries are and try to take care of him and do things for him that he should be doing for himself. Why do you pay half his child support? Why do you take care of all the family business, accounting, and car repairs, which take so much time? Because he has a “real” job? Just because you work at home doesn’t mean your time and your job as a writer aren’t valuable. Why have you tried to get him the best lawyer to fight for custody of his son? You are trying to control the way he feels about you and how he treats you. So your husband is right. You are trying to control him. This is called co-dependency.”  It's hard to say the word "Abuse"  Learning that I was being abused and that I was trying to earn my husband's love and respect, learning that the more he abused me, the harder I tried to please him--was not an easy lesson. A young woman, Dawn, from Dr. Irene's Verbally Abusive Web Site, reached out to me after reading a post I put there. She became my lifeline, teacher, mentor. My mother joined in our group and also my prior step-daughter, Tammy, who was then also going through a nasty divorce. We learned a lot from our little email group. So we compiled the trail of e-mails to each other and openly share them with you. You will learn about abuse the way we did--revealed a little at a time through our "healing" group online.   Read this booklet while you wait for the " respect-me R·U·L·E·S." Come meet myself, Dawn, Tammy, and Mom in an incredible journey as we traverse through partner abuse, how we learn about self-respect and begin to change the destructive patterns in our lives. In this PDF booklet, we share our journey to help prepare you for the life-changing work in  respect-me  R·U·L·E·S . Order  today and read about our journey as you wait for your book.  We left our emails in their raw form so you could share our progress and light bulb moments as we did. Growing and being responsible for ourselves wasn't easy. But as a result of this email support group, Dr. Marshall and myself devised the twelve RULES as a roadmap to acquire the respect and relationships you always deserve.  This PDF email journal should give you someplace to begin your own journey. It prepares you for the life-changing techniques found in our book   respect-me R·U·L·E·S  . FREE    Download the PDF Email trail NOW    Email Trail of Self-Help   The true story and actual emails of four women over a two year period who worked and supported each other via email to understand verbal and emotional abuse in their relationships, help each other learn to make better choices and demand the respect they deserve. It gets repetitive and highly personal at times but records the actual events as they happened. We hope you are able to identify and see how the process works.    Mar  08  Reader comment   Time spent in an abusive relationship steals from us the ability to look for real love.We’re so busy trying to figure out what is wrong and how to make it right that the wonderful people who might love us for who we are and not how they can control and destroy us never get a chance.--Susan            Michael J Marshall PhD  Shelly Marshall, BS CSAC  YouAreATarget.com
