Consider, for example, the way we use and abuse email distribution lists. I'm not talking about commercial lists, on which we all find ourselves because we subscribed to an online publication. I'm talking about all those lists we create in the workplace in order to 'keep everyone in the loop'. This sounds good in principle, but it overlooks the fact that not everyone needs or wants to be kept in the loop all the time. It seems there are many people who feel that part of the business email process means they have to send copies of their every waking thought to everyone they know, or have ever known! This may be a slight exaggeration, but if you've ever been on a number of email lists at work, you'll understand how it can seem that way. How often have you received email on a regular basis from someone whose list you are on, even though you have no interested in, or need to know, about the subject matter? I'm picturing you nodding your head.  So now, look at it from the other side. Do you have people on your internal mailing lists to whom you send regular bulletins on subjects about which they know little and care even less? Nodding again --- a little guiltily this time? This practice creates two undesirable results. First, people's time is wasted as they plough through an unnecessarily full mailbox, looking for messages they do need to read. Second, and probably even more of a problem, often several (or all) the people on the list feel they have to respond or join in a conversation, prompting one of those flurries of email flying in all directions, confusing and frustrating everyone. When this happens, the one comment that really means something can often be lost in the confusion. So what should we do about this? Two things: one to correct the problem from each side. First, don't automatically send information to everyone on any list. If the information you are sending is really only for Tony, don't send it to the whole department. This may take a moment's extra thought, but it's a worthy use of a moment of your time. Second, wherever possible, approach (in person, not by email) those who have you on their lists. I realize this is not always practical, but it is feasible more often than you realize. Say something like, "Amanda, thank you for working to keep me in the loop. But my emailbox is overflowing and out of control, as yours probably is too. I'd really appreciate it if you would take me off your distribution list, and email me only when it's about something you feel I need to know or can help you with." People have told me that when they do this, the other person often asks them to do the same, as everyone is in the same position. So everybody wins. I still believe strongly in the value of email as a communication tool, but to really make the most of it we need to pay more attention to business email etiquette, which is, after all, just simple courtesy.
