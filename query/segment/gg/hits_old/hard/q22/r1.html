    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">The U.S. Government -- often in collaboration
    with its allies -- controls the export of certain technologies and commodities to
    countries that for various reasons are judged to be inappropriate recipients. The
    violation of these export controls is commonly referred to as illegal technology transfer. 
    It is a criminal act
    and is a serious security concern.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">The Arms Export Control Act regulates the
    export of U.S. arms and implements of war (including cryptography) and 
    defense technology to proscribed countries that could misuse or cause 
    illegal proliferation of those items.&nbsp; Such exports may be licensed only if their export
    will strengthen U.S. national security, promote foreign policy goals, or foster world
    peace. The Arms Export Control Act is administered by the Department of State's 
    Office of
    Defense Trade Controls, through the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and
    the U.S. Munitions List. The Munitions List is a list of defense articles that require a
    license prior to export.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">The Export Administration Act regulates the
    export of restricted dual-use technologies to countries where they may be 
    used in ways that are inimical to U.S. interests. Dual-use technologies have 
    both military and civilian applications. This includes, for example, certain 
    technologies that are used for the manufacture or delivery of weapons of 
    mass destruction. These export controls are administered by the Department 
    of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) through the Export 
    Administration Regulations (EAR) and Commodity Control List. The Commodity Control List includes items from the
    Defense Department's <a href="mctl.htm#Militarily Critical">Militarily Critical
    Technologies List</a> </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">The BIS Office of Export Enforcement 
    conducted more than 1,200 export enforcement investigations during the 
    period between October 2003 and May 2005.These resulted in 49 arrests, 42 
    criminal convictions (with prosecution of the remaining cases ongoing) and 
    criminal fines totaling $9.8 million. During that same period, it imposed 
    more than $8.8 million in administrative penalties and other administrative 
    sanctions as a result of more than 100 closed administrative enforcement 
    cases. This information plus short case summaries of many of the convictions 
    are available on the BIS web site at
    <a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/ComplianceAndEnforcement/index.htm">

    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">In many cases of illegal technology 
    transfer, the intended end-user is a country with which the United States 
    has significant policy differences, but this is by no means always the case. Some friendly countries 
    also try to avoid U.S. export controls in order to gain economic advantage 
    or enhance their military capability vis-a-vis a 
    hostile neighbor. The illegal end-user may also be a corporation or research 
    institute rather than the national government. One outdated but still representative study of illegal technology transfer operations during the
    12-year period from 1981 to 1993 identified 56 different end-user countries.<a href="#1.">1</a> The same study found as follows:</font><ul>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">Various schemes were used to get around the
        requirement for an export license. In over half the cases, the goods were simply purchased
        and shipped by another U.S. company (often a front company) without a license in hopes
        they would get past Customs without incident. Fraudulent end-user certificates were used
        in many cases. In other cases, military items were declared as civilian, high tech items
        were declared as low tech, shipping documents were falsified, export licenses were forged,
        or a partial license was used rather than a full license.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">By far the most common means of shipping the
        goods out of the United States was to export them first to a friendly country, then
        transship them to a proscribed end-user. Half the transshipments during the time period
        covered by this study were via Europe, most commonly via Germany, Switzerland or the
        United Kingdom. The next most common procedure was for goods to be ordered by a U.S.
        individual or company which then mislabeled them and repackaged and reshipped them
        illegally to the end-user. Less frequently, goods were concealed in personal luggage,
        delivered directly to a foreign diplomatic mission in the U.S., or smuggled in a chartered
        transport.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">The initial buyer in illegal technology
    transfer operations is often a front company in the U.S. set up to acquire technology
    legally and then export it illegally to an unauthorized recipient.&nbsp;</font></p>

      <strong>The best security
      countermeasure is for a business to know its customers. When a &quot;new company&quot;
      enters the picture requesting sensitive or classified information or technology, prudent
      risk management would suggest doing some checking of the company's history. 
      For companies handling classified information, this is mandated under the 
      National Industrial Security Program (NISP).</strong></font></font></p>

    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">To help U.S. businesses recognize indicators
    of possible intent to circumvent export regulations, the Department of Commerce's Bureau
    of Industry and Security developed the following check list:<a href="#2."> 2</a></font><ul>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The customer or its address is similar to one
        of the parties found on the Commerce Department's list of denied persons.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The customer or purchasing agent is reluctant
        to offer information about the end-use of the item.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The product's capabilities do not fit the
        buyer's line of business, such as an order for sophisticated computers for a small bakery.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The item ordered is incompatible with the
        technical level of the country to which it is being shipped, such as semiconductor
        manufacturing equipment being shipped to a country that has no electronics industry.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The customer is willing to pay cash for a very
        expensive item when the terms of the sale would normally call for financing.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The customer has little or no business
        background.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The customer is unfamiliar with the product's
        performance characteristics but still wants the product.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">Routine installation, training, or maintenance
        services are declined by the customer.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">Delivery dates are vague, or deliveries are
        planned for out of the way destinations.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">A freight forwarding firm is listed as the
        product's final destination.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The shipping route is abnormal for the product
        and destination.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">Packaging is inconsistent with the stated
        method of shipment or destination.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">When questioned, the buyer is evasive and
        especially unclear about whether the product being sought is for domestic use, for export,
        or for reexport.</font></li>

    for reporting suspected export violations is 1-800-424-2980.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">Information on export controls is now
    available on the Internet in an up-to-date database at
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/">www.bis.doc.gov</a>.

    Commerce Control List, the Commerce Country Chart, and the Denied Persons List.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">In checking the origin of any request for 
    classified information, it may be useful to know whether the requesting 
    organization has a DoD facility security clearance. The Defense Security 
    Service maintains a database that enables any organization with a DoD 
    facility clearance to check whether or not any other organization has such a 
    clearance. It is called the Central Verification Activity (CVA) and can be
