    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">The U.S. Government -- often in collaboration
    with its allies -- controls the export of certain technologies and commodities to
    countries that for various reasons are judged to be inappropriate recipients. The
    violation of these export controls is commonly referred to as illegal technology transfer
    and is a serious security concern.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">The Arms Export Control Act regulates the
    export of defense articles and services. Such exports may be licensed only if their export
    will strengthen U.S. national security, promote foreign policy goals, or foster world
    peace. The Arms Export Control Act is administered by the Department of State, Center for
    Defense Trade Controls, through the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and
    the U.S. Munitions List. The Munitions List is a list of defense articles that require a
    license prior to export.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">The Export Administration Act regulates the
    export of dual-use items, that is, items that have both military and civilian uses.
    Dual-use items that would make a significant contribution to the military potential of
    another country are on the Department of Commerce's Commodity Control List, and a license
    is required for their export.&nbsp; The Commodity Control List includes items from the
    Defense Department's <a href="Mctl.htm#Militarily Critical">Militarily Critical
    Technologies List</a> and technology that could support the proliferation of chemical,
    biological, or nuclear weapons or missile technology.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">A number of countries conduct major programs
    to avoid U.S. export controls. The potential magnitude of such programs is illustrated by
    the program conducted by the former Soviet Union. After the demise of the Soviet Union,
    the Russian government made public annual reports from the Chief of the KGB (Soviet
    Intelligence) to the Secretary General of the Communist Party, Michael Gorbachev, for the
    years 1985, 1986, 1988 and 1989. These reports state that the KGB acquired 12,000 to
    13,000 samples of equipment or products each year from the West.&nbsp; Principal customers
    for these samples were the Ministry of Defense, Military-Industrial Commission, and the
    State Committee for Science and Technology. Not all these samples were obtained from the
    U.S., and not all of them were obtained illegally, but a majority probably were.<a href="#1.">1</a></font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">In many cases of illegal technology transfer,
    the intended end-user is a country whose policies are unfriendly to the United States, but
    this is not always the case. Some friendly countries obtain U.S. technology illegally to
    seek economic advantage. One study of illegal technology transfer operations during the
    12-year period from 1981 to 1993 identified 56 different end-user countries.<a href="#2.">2</a> The same study found as follows:</font><ul>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The types of goods being exported illegally
        were: 38% dual-use equipment (e.g., high performance computers, laser mirrors,
        oscilloscopes); 31% weapons components (e.g., radar tubes, aircraft parts); 15% entire
        weapons (e.g., TOW missiles, fighter aircraft); 13% nonlethal military equipment (e.g.,
        night-vision goggles); and 3% commercial commodities (e.g., commercial jet engines).</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">Various schemes were used to get around the
        requirement for an export license. In over half the cases, the goods were simply purchased
        and shipped by another U.S. company (often a front company) without a license in hopes
        they would get past Customs without incident. Fraudulent end-user certificates were used
        in many cases. In other cases, military items were declared as civilian, high tech items
        were declared as low tech, shipping documents were falsified, export licenses were forged,
        or a partial license was used rather than a full license.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">By far the most common means of shipping the
        goods out of the United States was to export them first to a friendly country, then
        transship them to a proscribed end-user. Half the transshipments during the time period
        covered by this study were via Europe, most commonly via Germany, Switzerland or the
        United Kingdom. The next most common procedure was for goods to be ordered by a U.S.
        individual or company which then mislabeled them and repackaged and reshipped them
        illegally to the end-user. Less frequently, goods were concealed in personal luggage,
        delivered directly to a foreign diplomatic mission in the U.S., or smuggled in a chartered
        transport.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">The initial buyer in illegal technology
    transfer operations is often a front company in the U.S. set up to acquire technology
    legally and then export it illegally to an unauthorized recipient.&nbsp;</font></p>

      <strong>The best security
      countermeasure is for a business to know its customers. When a &quot;new company&quot;
      enters the picture requesting sensitive or classified information or technology, prudent
      risk management would suggest doing some checking of the company's history.</strong></font></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">To help U.S. businesses recognize indicators
    of possible intent to circumvent export regulations, the Department of Commerce's Bureau
    of Export Administration developed the following check list:<a href="#3."> 3</a></font><ul>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The customer or its address is similar to one
        of the parties found on the Commerce Department's list of denied persons.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The customer or purchasing agent is reluctant
        to offer information about the end-use of the item.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The product's capabilities do not fit the
        buyer's line of business, such as an order for sophisticated computers for a small bakery.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The item ordered is incompatible with the
        technical level of the country to which it is being shipped, such as semiconductor
        manufacturing equipment being shipped to a country that has no electronics industry.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The customer is willing to pay cash for a very
        expensive item when the terms of the sale would normally call for financing.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The customer has little or no business
        background.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The customer is unfamiliar with the product's
        performance characteristics but still wants the product.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">Routine installation, training, or maintenance
        services are declined by the customer.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">Delivery dates are vague, or deliveries are
        planned for out of the way destinations.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">A freight forwarding firm is listed as the
        product's final destination.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">The shipping route is abnormal for the product
        and destination.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">Packaging is inconsistent with the stated
        method of shipment or destination.</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">When questioned, the buyer is evasive and
        especially unclear about whether the product being sought is for domestic use, for export,
        or for reexport.</font></li>
