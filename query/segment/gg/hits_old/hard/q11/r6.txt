The accusations came after two American tobacco companies agreed on Friday to pay nearly US$30 million to settle charges that they bribed foreign officials to get lucrative overseas tobacco sales contracts. Local officials could not be reached for comment yesterday. Universal Corp of Richmond, Virginia, and Alliance One International of Morrisville, North Carolina, face civil and criminal charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. Universal was accused of bribing officials in Thailand, Malawi and Mozambique, while Alliance One was accused of bribing officials in Thailand, China, Greece, Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan. Alliance One pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiring to violate the US's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). "The charges relate to bribes paid to Thai government officials to secure contracts with the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly, a Thai government agency, for the sale of tobacco leaf," the Justice Department said. Alliance One was formed in 2005 from the merger of Dimon Incorporated and Standard Commercial Corporation, two tobacco wholesalers. It buys, processes and sells tobacco to manufacturers worldwide. The guilty pleas relate to the conduct of employees and agents of foreign subsidiaries of both Dimon and Standard prior to the 2005 merger, the US Justice Department said. The department said that it had also filed two counts against Universal Brazil for conspiring to violate the FCPA by paying bribes to Thailand Tobacco Monopoly employees for the sale of Brazilian tobacco. It didn't say how many Thai officials were involved. The Justice Department said that from 2000 to 2004, Dimon, Standard and Universal Brazil sold Brazilian tobacco to the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly. No Thai officials were named by the department. "Each of the three companies retained sales agents in Thailand, and collaborated through those agents to apportion tobacco sales to the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly among themselves, co-ordinate their sales prices, and pay kickbacks to officials of the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly in order to ensure that each company would share in the Thai tobacco market. "To secure the sales contracts, each company admitted it paid kickbacks to certain Thailand Tobacco Monopoly representatives based on the number of kilogrammes of tobacco sold to the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly. "To obtain these contracts, Dimon paid bribes totalling $542,590 and Standard paid bribes totalling $696,160, for a total of $1,238,750 in bribes paid to the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly officials during the course of four years." Universal admitted paying $697,000 in kickbacks to the monopoly officials, the Justice Department said. It had agreed to pay a $4.4 million fine and retain an anti-corruption monitor for three years. Universal Corp said the company voluntarily reported the problems to authorities and that it has cooperated with the investigation. http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/loca...ok-b62m-bribes                         Sponsored Links                           09-08-2010, 04:14 PM    #  2  (  permalink  )    Begbie   On Remand        Last Online: Yesterday 10:42 PM Join Date: Mar 2006 Location: Lagrangian Point Posts: 9,026                  Finance probe into tobacco bribes The Thailand Tobacco Monopoly will be asked to explain allegations by the United States that its staff accepted US$1.93 million (62 million baht) in bribes to buy Brazilian tobacco leaf, Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij said on Monday. The US Justice Department claims TTM staff accepted bribes from US-based Universal Corp of Richmond, Virginia, and Alliance One International of Morrisville, North Carolina, to ensure TTM bought Brazilian-grown tobacco during the years 2000-2004. Mr Korn said the Finance Ministry would launch an investigation to find out iintio the allegation. "The investigation will be swift, transparent and straightforward," he said. Mr Korn admitted he did not yet have details of the alleged corruption because the news was reported from abroad and he had not yet discussed this matter with his deputy Pradit Pattaraprasit, who supervises the TTM.

Mr Korn yesterday said staff at the state-owned cigarette maker were accused of taking bribes from 2000 to 2003. He said he had learned about the scandal from news reports and so had ordered the TTM to report to him with all the details. Severe action would be taken against anyone involved if the allegations proved to be true. The US Justice Department claims TTM staff accepted bribes of more than US$1.93 million (62 million baht) from US-based companies to ensure TTM bought Brazilian-grown tobacco. Universal Corp of Richmond, Virginia, and Alliance One International of Morrisville, North Carolina, face civil and criminal charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. Universal is accused of bribing officials in Thailand, Malawi and Mozambique, while Alliance One is accused of bribing officials in Thailand, China, Greece, Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan. TTM deputy director Amnart Permchart said he had checked the allegations and found the payments were made during the purchase of overseas tobacco several years ago. He would report to the TTM committee on what steps needed to be taken against those involved. "It was possible that bribes were paid when the TTM bought tobacco from Brazil, where the price of tobacco leaf is cheaper than that from the US," Mr Amnart said. A tobacco regulation states that purchases of over 50 million baht require the approval of the TTM committee. Thailand imported overseas tobacco worth some 1.8 billion baht between 2003 and 2004. Mr Amnart said the TTM had to import tobacco leaf as overseas tobacco was a key ingredient in local cigarette production. Tobacco leaf is imported from the US, China, Brazil and Zimbabwe.  __________________  "Thaksin thinks, Puea Thai acts"   To view links or images in signatures your post count must be 0 or greater.

False, if they are Dems/PAD/army... But, they are all so fully into the pit of corruption, that if Korn (a complete wanka...) pushes this thinking he can crush some reds, then he will get some friendlies too, so he will be told by a bigger brother/unle/etc to let it go, and nothing will come of it...                              10-08-2010, 03:08 PM    #  10  (  permalink  )    Nostradamus  Guest   Posts: n/a     Quote: Originally Posted by  StrontiumDog  Mr Amnart said the TTM had to import tobacco leaf as overseas tobacco was a key ingredient in local cigarette production.

The US Justice Dept. seem to make the briefs from the proceeding available after the fact. Of course, the people who received the bribes, names and position may be mentioned in print. They can then deny that they ever worked in any capacity for the tobacco monopoly. Think this is a repeat of history, just change names and amounts and which part of the government anatomy they are sucking on.                              10-08-2010, 06:08 PM    #  16  (  permalink  )    dirtydog   The Dog        Join Date: Jun 2005 Location: Pattaya Jomtien Posts: 56,601                     Quote: Originally Posted by  pet coon  Why asked the accused to provide details?

The whole scheme stopped in 2005, when TTM went to an open electronic auction system. Universal Leaf actually won the first auction without paying any special expenses and then quit bidding. The  FPCA blog  is a great source for these sort of things.

Tharit: Waits for word from ministry The National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC), the Public Sector Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC) and the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) will look into claims that TTM staff accepted US$1.93 million (62 million baht) in bribes to buy Brazilian tobacco leaf. The Finance Ministry, which supervises the state-owned cigarette maker, will ask the Justice Ministry to look into the allegations and seek information from the US Justice Department, DSI director-general Tharit Pengdit said yesterday. The Justice Ministry will then assign the DSI and the PACC to investigate, he said. The US Justice Department claims TTM staff accepted the bribes from US-based companies to ensure TTM purchased Brazilian-grown tobacco. Universal Corp of Richmond, Virginia, and Alliance One International of Morrisville, North Carolina, face civil and criminal charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. Universal is accused of bribing officials in Thailand, Malawi and Mozambique, while Alliance One is accused of bribing officials in Thailand, China, Greece, Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan. Kittipong: Separate inquiries Permanent secretary for justice Kittipong Kittayarak said the PACC would look into the involvement of state officials. The DSI would conduct its own investigation as bribe-taking was a serious offence. Mr Kittipong said Pakdi Porsiri, a member of the NACC, told him the national anti-graft agency was also interested in the case and would launch an inquiry. The permanent secretary said the three agencies would conduct separate investigations. The findings of the inquiries would be submitted to the NACC, which would give a ruling on what further action should be taken. Mr Pakdi said the NACC board would send staff to the US to work with the US Justice Department. The NACC would seek information from the TTM on its purchases of tobacco leaf between 2000 and 2004, and which staff were involved. An inquiry panel would then be set up, the NACC commissioner said.                                   «  Previous Thread |  Next Thread  »  Register  Forum Home  Donate  FAQ  Members List  Calendar  Today's Posts     Currently Active Users Viewing This Thread: 1  (0 members and 1 guests)        Thread Tools     Show Printable Version    Email this Page      Display Modes     Linear Mode    Switch to Hybrid Mode    Switch to Threaded Mode     Search this Thread             Advanced Search        Posting Rules    You  may not post new threads You  may not post replies You  may not post attachments You  may not edit your posts vB code is  On  Smilies are  On  [IMG] code is  On  HTML code is  Off  Trackbacks are  On  Pingbacks are  On  Refbacks are  On                Thailand Beach Guide     Thai Dating     Advertise Here!
