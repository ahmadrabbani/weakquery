There is currently no Federal law that prohibits Internet tobacco product sales. However, there is also no exemption from Federal laws for tobacco products ordered over the Internet.  Therefore, consumers who order tobacco products to be shipped to them from outside the United States are not exempt from payment of Federal excise tax and customs duties due on these products when imported. In addition, consumers who use the Internet to buy cigarettes from vendors outside their State may be liable for their State’s cigarette excise and/or sales taxes, and a State may have prohibitions or restrictions on Internet or mail-order purchases of tobacco products, or may have special requirements for such purchases.  For information about State requirements, contact the agency in your State with authority for tax administration.  Under Federal law, cigarette vendors who sell and ship cigarettes into another State to anyone other than a licensed distributor must report to the State (1) the name and address of the person(s) to whom cigarettes shipments were made, (2) the brands of cigarettes shipped, and (3) the quantities of cigarettes shipped. (Jenkins Act 15 U.S.C. 375 – 378)  Consumers should also be aware that cigarettes manufactured in the U.S. and labeled and shipped for export cannot be brought back into the U.S. except by the original manufacturer or by an export warehouse proprietor authorized by the original manufacturer.  No quantity of cigarettes originally manufactured in the U.S. for export may be brought back into the U.S. by you as a consumer, except for the limited quantity that you are allowed to bring back into the country as a returning traveler.  This prohibition applies to even small Internet purchases that you make for your own personal use.  Cigarettes manufactured in the U.S. for export are required to have a notice on the package.  In general, this notice is: “U.S. Tax-exempt. For use outside the U.S.”  Packages bearing the export mark may not be sold or held for sale for domestic consumption in the U.S. and are subject to seizure by U.S. officials.   T2: What Federal laws does the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) enforce concerning  tobacco products ?   In general, TTB enforces  Chapter 52 of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26 of the United States Code).   Chapter 52 of the Internal Revenue Code  deals mainly with the Federal excise taxes on  tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes and other requirements, such as permits required for engaging in business related to the manufacture, importation and other operations involving such products.    T3:  What other Federal laws relate to tobacco products and who enforces these other Federal laws?  As of July 5, 2007, the following Federal laws related to tobacco products apply.  Please note that this list may not be comprehensive, is subject to change, and is provided for general information purposes only.  TTB does not administer, enforce, or interpret these statutory provisions.  For any questions about a statutory provision listed here, please contact the agency responsible for its administration. Jenkins Act (15 U.S.C. 375 – 378).   In general, under the Jenkins Act, cigarette vendors who sell and ship cigarettes into another state to anyone other than a licensed distributor must report to the receiving State (1) the name and address of the person(s) to whom cigarettes shipments were made, (2) the brands of cigarettes shipped, and (3) the quantities of cigarettes shipped.  Reports must be filed with a State’s tobacco tax administrator no later than the 10th day of each calendar month covering each and every cigarette shipment made to the State during the previous calendar month.  The sellers must also file a statement with the State’s tobacco tax administrator listing the seller’s name, trade name (if any), and address of all business locations.  Failure to comply with the Jenkins Act’s reporting requirements is a misdemeanor offense, and violators are to be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than 6 months, or both.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Justice Department enforces these provisions of law. Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act (18 U.S.C. Chapter 114, 2341 – 2346).   In general, this Act makes it unlawful for any person to ship, transport, receive, possess, sell, distribute, or purchase more than 10,000 cigarettes and/or 500 single‑unit consumer‑sized cans or packages of smokeless tobacco, or their equivalent, that bear no evidence of state tax payment in the State in which the cigarettes are found, if that State requires a stamp or other indication to be placed on packages to demonstrate tax payment.  Certain persons are exempt, including permit holders under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, common carriers with proper bills of lading, or individuals licensed by the State where the cigarettes are found (18 U.S.C. 2341).  The Act also imposes recordkeeping and reporting requirements and imposes civil and criminal penalties for violation.  See 18 U.S.C. 2344.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, U.S. Justice Department enforces these provisions of Federal law. Tobacco Transition Payment Program (TTPP), also referred to as the “Tobacco Buyout”.   This program ended the tobacco quota program and established a 10-year transitional period during which payments are made to tobacco quota holders and producers.  This program is funded through assessments on domestic manufacturers and importers of tobacco products.    The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Commodity Credit Corporation sends a notice of the amount of assessment to each manufacturer or importer, on a quarterly basis.  The assessment is due 30 days following notification.  This program continues until 2014.  Information about this program can be found at  www.fsa.usda.gov/tobacco .  The Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA), (15 U.S.C 1331 – 1341) and the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 4401 – 4408).  The FCLAA requires, in part, that each person who manufactures, packages, or imports cigarettes annually submit to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), a list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes (Ingredient Report).  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Office on Smoking and Health (OSH), has been delegated the responsibility of implementing these provisions.  The Ingredient Report must include all additives and flavors.  Submissions are due to CDC, OSH by March 31st; and for importers, the Ingredient Report is also due upon initial importation into the United States.  The report submitted by March 31st each year must represent the ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes during the previous calendar year.   The Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act, in part requires each manufacturer, packager, or importer of smokeless tobacco products to annually submit to the Department of Health and Human Services the list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of smokeless tobacco products (Ingredient Report).   It further requires the submission of the quantity of nicotine contained in each smokeless tobacco product (Nicotine Report).  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Office on Smoking and Health (OSH), has been delegated the responsibility of implementing these provisions.  More information can be found at www.cdc.gov/tobacco.  In addition to the reporting requirements, under the FCLAA, Federal Trade Commission has administrative responsibilities for the Surgeon General's health warnings required for cigarettes.   The FTC has both administrative and enforcement responsibilities for the health warnings required for smokeless tobacco packaging and advertising under the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986.   The FTC’s regulations specify the placement and rotation of the warnings on these products, and require companies to submit plans to the Commission setting forth their rotation schedules. The FTC also enforces the ban in the Smokeless Tobacco Act on broadcasting smokeless tobacco advertisements on radio and television.  Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 1451- 1461).  The Federal Trade Commission enforces Federal law concerning accurate information shown on packages and labels for the benefit of the consumer in general.  In addition, statements must not mislead, or otherwise be unfair or deceptive with respect to “made in U.S.A.’ or similar statements (see 15 U.S.C. 45a). Importation requirements .  U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collects the Federal excise tax as well as customs duties and other fees imposed on imported tobacco products, and enforces the statutory requirement that persons engaged in the business of importing tobacco products first obtain a TTB permit.  Separate from TTB requirements, CBP also requires certain records and reports (19 U.S.C. 1484).  In addition, CBP enforces some statutory provisions related to markings on imported products.  In general, under 19 U.S.C. 1304, every article of foreign origin, or its container, imported into the United States must be conspicuously marked with the English name of the country of origin of the article.  More information about importation requirements can be found at www.cbp.gov.     T4: Who can I contact about a person selling cigarettes or other  tobacco products that were intended to be free for customers (for example, buy one pack and get one free)? You can contact the manufacturer listed on the package of cigarettes or other  tobacco products . The manufacturer may be interested in knowing that their "free" promotional or complimentary cigarettes are being sold. Also, you may also contact your  state tax agency about whether sale of "free" cigarettes or other  tobacco products is legal. The Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) does not regulate how "free" (promotional or complimentary) cigarettes or other  tobacco products are sold. TTB regulates the taxation of cigarettes and  tobacco products . Federal excise tax is normally collected when a manufacturer removes cigarettes or other  tobacco products from a factory or when an importer removes such products from customs custody.    T5: Who can I contact about a person in the United States selling cigarettes or other  tobacco products   that are marked "Tax-exempt. For use outside U.S." or with a similar notice?
