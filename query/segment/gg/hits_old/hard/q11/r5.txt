The world's fourth-largest tobacco company is considering entering the United States, a move that could have a big impact on two large Triad companies. Imperial Tobacco Group plc, a British company, sees the United States as a potentially profitable market with less risk of lawsuits than there was three or four years ago. CEO Gareth Davis told news agency Bloomberg last week that he considered the U.S. an attractive market. Such a move would likely shake up the U.S. cigarette market, and could pose new challenges to Winston-Salem-based Reynolds American Inc. (NYSE: RAI) and Greensboro-based Lorillard Tobacco Co. (NYSE: CG). Imperial is considerably larger than either of those companies, earning revenues of about $21.5 billion in 2005, based on Monday's exchange rates. By comparison, Reynolds, the second-largest U.S. tobacco company, had total revenues of $8.3 billion in 2005 and Lorillard, the No. 3 cigarette company, had revenues of $3.6 billion. Philip Morris USA, the country's biggest cigarette maker, had sales of $18.1 billion in 2005, though that was just a fraction of its overall business, as its parent company, Altria Group, brought in another $45.3 billion in overseas cigarette sales and $34.4 billion from its food operations. Imperial's cigarette brands include West and Davidoff. It already does business in 130 countries.

New York City cigarette smokers pay some of the highest taxes in the USA. A package of cigarettes in the City of New York is burdened with $0.39 in federal excise tax, $1.50 in state tax, and another $1.50 in city tax. Online discount cigarettes has become a catchphrase amon {!!!start promo text}Next, let's examine the economic and public finance implications of higher cigarette prices. For starters, more than half of any price increases will be paid by smokers with annual incomes under $30,000; only 1 percent will be paid by smokers earning more than $100,000. In other words, cigarettes surcharges are brutally regressive; they represent a wealth transfer from generally poor smokers to more affluent non-smokers. If prices rise by $2.00 per pack, a two-pack-a-day smoker will be hit with $1,460 in added expense each year. That's an enormous burden for a low-income consumer.{end of promo text!!!} g the patrons of premium brands such as Marlboro, Newport, Doral, Parliament, Camel and Barclay. With the advent of discount cigarettes, one can now enjoy their favorite brand at a much lower cost. Websites displaying the "  discount cigarettes  " tag offer a variety of premium and generic cigarette brands at heavily discounted prices, owing to the tax exemption that online sales enjoy.
