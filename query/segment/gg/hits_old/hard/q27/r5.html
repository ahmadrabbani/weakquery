      <h4><a name="intro"></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Introduction</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On Friday, February 
        21, 1947, the British Embassy informed the U.S. State Department officials 
        that Great Britain could no longer provide financial aid to the governments 
        of Greece and Turkey. American policymakers had been monitoring Greece's 
        crumbling economic and political conditions, especially the rise of the 
        Communist-led insurgency known as the National Liberation Front, or the 
        EAM/ELAS. The United States had also been following events in Turkey, 
        where a weak government faced Soviet pressure to share control of the 
        strategic Dardanelle Straits. When Britain announced that it would withdraw 
        aid to Greece and Turkey, the responsibility was passed on to the United 
        States.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In a meeting between 
        Congressmen and state department officials, Undersecretary of State Dean 
        Acheson articulated what would later become known as the domino theory. 
        He stated that more was at stake than Greece and Turkey, for if those 
        two key states should fall, Communism would likely spread south to Iran 
        and as far east as India. Acheson concluded that not since the days of 
        Rome and Carthage had such a polarization of power existed. The stunned 
        legislators agreed to endorse the program on the condition that President 
        Truman stress the severity of the crisis in an address to Congress and 
        in a radio broadcast to the American people. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Addressing a joint 
        session of Congress on March 12, 1947, President Harry S. Truman asked 
        for $400 million in military and economic assistance for Greece and Turkey 
        and established a doctrine, aptly characterized the Truman Doctrine, that 
        would guide U.S. diplomacy for the next forty years. President Truman 
        declared, "It must be the policy of the United States to support free 
        peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or 
        by outside pressures." The sanction of aid to Greece and Turkey by a Republican 
        Congress indicated the beginning of a long and enduring bipartisan cold 
        war foreign policy. The Truman Doctrine has raised profound questions 
        from historians regarding its origins, long-term consequences, and the 
        relationship between domestic and foreign policy. However, one thing is 
        for certain, the Truman Doctrine signaled America's post war embrace of 
        global leadership and ended its longstanding policy of isolationism. </font>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Activity 1</font></h4>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Introduction</b></font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On Friday, February 
        21, 1947, Great Britain notified the United States that it could no longer 
        provide financial aid to the governments of Greece and Turkey. American 
        policy makers had been monitoring Greece's deteriorating economic and 
        political conditions. There was a civil war taking place between the Greek 
        monarchy and communist <b>guerillas</b>, and there was a severe economic 
        crisis. The United States was also observing Turkey, where a weak government 
        faced Soviet pressure to share control of the <b>Dardanelles Straits</b>. 
        Both Turkey and Greece had in modern times depended on Britain's diplomatic 
        and economic support, but it now seemed that London planned to pass this 
        responsibility on to the United States.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Like much of the 
        chaos of the early cold war, the problems of Greece and Turkey stemmed 
        from World War II. Turkey's dilemma derived from Stalin's demands for 
        joint control of the Dardanelles. When negotiations for this joint control 
        failed, Stalin stationed troops near the Turkish border. Meanwhile, Greece 
        faced a political <b>vacuum</b> and civil war following the withdrawal 
        in October 1944 of Nazi occupation forces from the war-ravaged land. <b>EAM-ELAS</b> 
        rebels received outside assistance from Communist Yugoslavia and neighboring 
        Albania and Bulgaria, and inflicted havoc on the unstable Greek monarchy. 
        Great Britain, aware that Greece was an important Middle Eastern <b>sphere 
        of influence</b>, supported the country's right-wing government. </font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When forces of liberation 
        entered Greece they found that the retreating Germans had destroyed virtually 
        all the railways, roads, port facilities, communications, and merchant 
        marine. More than a thousand villages had been burned. Eighty-five percent 
        of the children were <b>tubercular</b>. Livestock, poultry, and draft 
        animals had almost disappeared. Inflation had wiped out practically all 
        savings</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As a result of these 
        tragic conditions, a militant minority, exploiting human want and misery, 
        was able to create political chaos which, until now, has made economic 
        recovery impossible"</font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Conditions in Turkey 
        were not as desperate as those in Greece, but the country was still experiencing 
        severe economic problems and threats from the Soviet Union at its borders. 
        By 1945 agricultural output had fallen to 70 percent of the 1939 figure, 
        and per capita income had fallen to 75 percent. Inflation was strong: 
        official statistics show a rise of 354 percent between 1938 and 1945, 
        but this figure probably understates the fall in the value of money, which 
        in 1943 was less than one-fifth its 1938 purchasing power. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Turkey clung to neutrality 
        until an <b>Axis</b> defeat became inevitable; it entered the war on the 
        <b>Allied</b> side on Feb. 23, 1945. The great expansion of Soviet power 
        exposed Turkey in June 1945 to Soviet demands for control over the <b>Dardanelles 
        Straits</b> and for the <b>cession</b> of territory in eastern Asia Minor. 
        It was also suggested that a large area of northeastern <b>Anatolia</b> 
        be ceded to Soviet Georgia. This caused Turkey to seek and receive U.S. 
        assistance; U.S. military aid began in 1947 (providing the basis for a 
        large and continuing flow of military aid), and economic assistance began 
        in 1948. </font>

      <blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"At the present 
        moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative 
        ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one. One way of life 
        is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, 
        representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, 
        freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression. 
        The second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed 
        upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled 
        press and radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms. 
        I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free 
        peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or 
        by outside pressures. I believe that we must assist free peoples to work 
        out their own destinies in their own way. I believe that our help should 
        be primarily through economic stability and orderly political process."

      <blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We weren't 
        concerned about markets; we were concerned about preventing Soviet control 
        of larger areas of the world than they already controlled. When the Second 
        World War ended, France was decimated. England was almost brought to its 
        knees, you'll remember, and if Hitler had moved at one time, he could 
        have probably brought them to their knees. The Soviet Union had gone through 
        the most traumatic experience of its career. I read that in the Second 
        World War it's estimated that the Soviet Union lost between twenty-five 
        and thirty million men. So I think they were just determined that it was 
        never going to happen to them again. But an enormous vacuum had been left 
        in the free world by the end of World War II, and the Soviet Union was 
        determined to move into that vacuum. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Now, that was the 
          basis of the Marshall plan when we were thinking about reviving Europe. 
          At the time the Soviets were pressing and searching and trying to find 
          every soft spot where they could insert themselves. That was the reason 
          for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; it was the reason for the
