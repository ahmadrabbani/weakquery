            12th March, 1947, <a href="USAtruman.htm">Harry S. Truman</a>, announced 
            details to Congress of what eventually became known as the <a href="USAtrumanD.htm">Truman 
            Doctrine</a>. In his speech he pledged American support for &quot;free 
            peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities 
            or by outside pressures&quot;. This speech also included a request 
            that Congress agree to give military and economic aid to Greece in 
            its fight against communism. <br>
            <br>
            Three months later <a href="USAmarshallG.htm">George C. Marshall</a>, 
            Truman's Secretary of State, announced details of what became known 
            as the </font></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Marshall 
            Plan or the European Recovery Program (ERP). Marshall offered American 
            financial aid for a programme of European economic recovery. <a href="TUbevin.htm">Ernest 
            Bevin</a>, the British foreign secretary, made it clear he fully supported 
            the scheme but the idea was rejected by the Soviet Union. A conference 
            was held in Paris in September and sixteen nations in Western Europe 
            agreed on a four year recovery plan. <br>
            <br>
            On 3rd April, 1948, <a href="USAtruman.htm">Harry S. Truman</a> signed 
            the first appropriation bill authorizing $5,300,000,000 for the first 
            year of the ERP. Paul G. Hoffman was appointed as head of the Organization 
            for Economic Cooperation (OEEC) administration and by 1951 was able 
            to report that industrial production in Western Europe had grown 30 
            per cent since the beginning of the <a href="2WW.htm">Second World 
            War</a>. <br>
            <br>
            The European Recovery Program came to an end on 31st December, 1951. 
            It its three year existence, the ERP spent almost $12,500,000,000. 
            It was succeeded by the Mutual Security Administration.</font></font></font>

            <br>
            </font></b><font face="Arial" color="Black">The seeds of totalitarian 
            regimes are nurtured by misery and want. They spread and grow in the 
            evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full potential when 
            the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that 
            hope alive. If we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace 
            of the world - and we shall surely endanger the welfare of our own 
            nation. <br>
            <br>
            At the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose 
            between alternative ways of life. The choice is often not a free one. 
            One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished 
            by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees 
            of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom 
            from political oppression. <br>
            <br>
            The second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly 
            imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a 
            controlled press and radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of 
            personal freedom. I believe that it must be the policy of the United 
            States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation 
            by armed minorities or by outside pressures. </font></font></p>

            and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy

            </font><font face="Arial" color="Black"><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial" color="Black">The 
            so-called Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan are particularly glaring 
            examples of the manner in which the principles of the United Nations 
            are violated, of the way in which the organization is ignored. This 
            is clearly proved by the measures taken by the United States Government 
            with regard to Greece and Turkey which ignore and bypass the United 
            States as well as the measures proposed under the so-called Marshall 
            Plan in Europe. <br>
            <br>
            This policy conflicts sharply with the principles expressed by the 
            General Assembly in its resolution of 11th December, 1946, which declares 
            that relief supplies to other countries &quot;should at no time be 
            used as a political weapon&quot;. It is becoming more and more evident 
            to everyone that the implementation of the Marshall Plan will mean 
            placing European countries under the economic and political control 
            of the United States. </font></font></font></p>

            are violated, of the way in which the Organisation is ignored. As 
            is now clear, the Marshall Plan constitutes in essence merely a variant 
            of the Truman Doctrine adapted to the conditions of postwar Europe. 
            In bringing forward this plan, the United States Government apparently 
            counted on the cooperation of the Governments of the United Kingdom 
            and France to confront the European countries in need of relief with 
            the necessity of renouncing their inalienable right to dispose of 
            their economic resources and to plan their national economy in their 
            own way. The United States also counted on making all these countries 
            directly dependent on the interests of American monopolies, which 
            are striving to avert the approaching depression by an accelerated 
            export of commodities and capital to Europe.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is becoming more and 
            more evident to everyone that the implementation of the Marshall Plan 
            will mean placing European countries under the economic and political 
            control of the United States and direct interference by the latter 
            in the internal affairs of those countries. Moreover, this plan is 
            an attempt to split Europe into two camps and, with the help of the 
            United Kingdom and France, to complete the formation of a bloc of 
            several European countries hostile to the interests of the democratic 
            countries of Eastern Europe and most particularly to the interests 
            of the Soviet Union. An important feature of this Plan is the attempt 
            to confront the - countries of Eastern Europe with a bloc of Western 
            European States including Western Germany. The intention is to make 
            use of Western Germany and German heavy industry (the Ruhr) as one 
            of the most important economic bases for American expansion in Europe, 
            in disregard of the national interests of the countries which suffered 
            from German aggression. </font></p>

            speech in Berne (23rd March, 1949) </font></b></font></p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is impossible to understand 
            the present condition of Germany without a brief survey of what happened 
            after 1945. The unconditional surrender of the German armed forces 
            in May 1945 was interpreted by the Allies to mean a complete transfer 
            of governmental authority into their hands. This interpretation was 
            wrong from the point of view of international law. By it the Allies 
            in practice assumed a task which it was impossible for them to fulfil. 
            I consider it to have been a grave mistake. They would have been unable 
            to solve this task with the best will in the world. There was bound 
            to be failure and this failure badly affected the prestige of the 
            Allies in Germany. It would have been wiser if the Allies had, after 
            a short intermediate state due to the confusion left by the war, let 
            the Germans order their affairs and had confined themselves to supervision. 
            Their attempt to govern this large disorganized country from outside, 
            often guided by extraneous political and economic criteria of their 
            own, was bound to fail. It brought about a rapid economic, physical, 
            and psychological disintegration of the Germans which might have been 
            avoided. It also seems that intentions such as had once been manifested 
            in the Morgenthau Plan played their part. This continued until the 
            Marshall Plan brought the turning point. The Marshall Plan will remain 
            for all time a glorious page in the history of the United States of 
            America. But the change was very slow and the economic, physical,

            It is clear that the main element of any United States policy towards 
            the Soviet Union must be that of a long-term, patient but firm and 
            vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies. It is clear 
            that the United states cannot expect in the foreseeable future to 
            enjoy political intimacy with the Soviet regime. It must continue 
            to regard the Soviet Union as a rival, not a partner, in the political 
            arena. </font> </font></p>

            Marshall Plan aid, essentially intended to keep the post-war economies 
            of the West Europe countries within the capitalist world, was also 
            intended to dominate their economy. Every transaction was arranged 
            to provide not only immediate profits for specific US banks, finance 
            corporations, investment trusts and industries, but to make the European 
            nations dependent on the United States.</font></p>
