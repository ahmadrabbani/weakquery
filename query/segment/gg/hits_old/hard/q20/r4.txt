The survey found that 30 per cent of the public want Britain to withdraw from the EU, that opposition to the single currency is growing and that people feel overwhelmingly British rather than European.  It also showed that only 53 per cent of voters want Britain to stay in the Union - even though EU membership is supported by all the three main political parties. The Foreign Secretary tried to play down the significance of this by saying support for staying in the EU had "increased quite dramatically" over the past year.  The poll was commissioned by BBC Radio 4's Today programme, which in the past has been accused of pro-European bias but which this week has run reports on what Britain would be like outside the EU.
