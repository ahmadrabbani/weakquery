Less that a year before the changeover, the majority do not agree with the government’s plan to take Cyprus into the Eurozone. The annual Cyprus Barometre issued yesterday indicates support for a single European currency has plunged from 71% in 2002 to 44% last year. “The barometre reflects apprehension. Cypriots were far more optimistic about the euro three or four years ago,” said Olympios Toumazou of RAI Consultants, which carried out the survey for Laiki.  When the 1000 respondents were asked specifically whether Cyprus should join the Eurozone, the majority of 51% disagreed and 41% agreed. This compares to 41% against and 46% in favour in the 2005 survey and suggests the government faces an uphill struggle to win over sceptical Cypriots. Membership Support for the Eurozone was most widespread among the higher income groups, the better educated and the residents of Nicosia and Paphos district. Opposition was most obvious in the Famagusta district and among lower income groups. In contrast, Cypriots seem to have warmed to the idea of EU membership, with a majority of 53% saying Cyprus has benefitted from EU membership – substantially up from 42% the previous year. Human rights, economic growth and the rights of working people were listed as the main sectors which have benefited from EU accession. But Cypriots are concerned that EU enlargement will lead to the influx of more foreign workers, drugs, organised crime and the transfer of jobs to countries where production costs are cheaper. They are also more optimistic about the economy as a whole, and their own personal economic situation, though the prevailing view is that the rich-poor gap will get worse. Factors seen as having a negative impact on economic developments were a sense of insecurity because of the national problem, labour costs, harmonisation with the acquis, government economic policy and liberalisation. The three sectors seen as facing the most problems were agriculture, tourism and industry. For the first time this year, respondents were asked about mergers and acquisitions by foreign companies. More than half (56%) anticipated a positive impact on cosnumers, while 48% said there would be a positive impact on the economy. A smaller 42% said it would have a positive effect on the job market. Deposit Cypriots also disagree with privatisation of state services or semi-government organisations with their opposition ranging from 71% for medical care to 57% for road construction.  The Internet seems to be making some advances, with the number of respondents saying they go on line rising to 32% from 25% the previous year. Property remains a firm investment favourite with 47% saying that they would buy land if they had extra money. Another 23% said they would give it to their children, 12% would deposit in the bank and 11% would buy a house or flat.  Nearly four out of 10 (38%) said they had shares on the CSE while 32% said they would invest on stock markets abroad if they had the money. Asked where they would prefer to invest money abroad, land topped the list with 60%, followed by the purchase of a house or flat (53%), a deposit in the bank (17%), mutual funds (12%) and bonds (7%). One in five (21%), plan to buy property in the next five years, up from 18% in 2005. Of these half (47%) said they planned to buy land – down from 58% the previous year. One in three said they planned to buy a house ­– almost twice the number of the previous year. The percentage of those who said they would buy a flat was stable at 25%. Half the respondents (48%) expect property prices to continue to rise at an even faster pace – up from 34% in 2005. Modelled on the Eurobarometer, the Cyprus Barometer has been carried out every year since it was first launched by the Planning and Economic Research Service of Laiki in 1996.  It seeks to track public opinion on a range of issues including the EU, the church, the economy, e-commerce, the environment and youth. Conditions The latest survey was carried out between December 18, 2006 and January 22, 2007. Here are some other highlights: The majority (75%) agree that Turkey should join the EU but with restrictions. Asked for the first time whether Cyprus should veto Turkey’s accession talks if the conditions set by the government are not met, an overwhelming majority of 85% said yes. Pessimism was predominant when it came to the Cyprus issue, wth only one out of 10 agreeing that a settlement can be expected soon. Drugs (35%) and the cost of living (18%) were cited as the most serious problems facing Cyprus today. Though Cypriots remain supporters of speed cameras, their installation on the island’s roads has led to a 7% drop in support to 69% over the previous year. The family is seen as the institution facing the biggest crisis with 34%, unseating the church which fell to second place with 21%. Cypriots trust the Republic of Cyprus most (69%), followed by the army (62%), police (60%) and church (48%). There is less trust in the House of Representatives (45%) and the EU (37%) and even less still in political parties (20%). Three out of four (74%) disagree with the church being involved in commercial activities, but are divided (44% versus 41%) on whether it should have a say in the national issue. Nine out of 10 Cypriots say their life is governed by family values and honesty. But seven out of ten say that the concern of other Cypriots is an easy life. The majority (59%) oppose the opening of casinos. A significant majority of 85% believe Cyprus faces a problem with the environment. Car emissions was top of the list (81%), followed by dirty roads (61%) and noise pollution (59%). SOURCE
