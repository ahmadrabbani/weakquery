 Hubble Telescope - Hubble Space Telescope

    Hubble Telescope History and Achievements  The Hubble Telescope is famous worldwide for its amazing images of the universe.    Congress in 1977 voted to fund a project to construct the Hubble. Completion of the telescope was in 1985. The Hubble was supposed to be launched a year later but was delayed because of the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.  The Hubble Space Telescope was launched on April 25th, 1990 on the space shuttle. The giant telescope Hubble sent back pictures from space that were out of focus. The giant mirror had a major flaw. It was too flat on one edge 1/50th of the width of a single human hair.  The Space Shuttle Endeavor in December 1993 captured and corrected the Hubble by adding to the telescope a camera to correct problems with the Hubble's mirror. In February 1997 astronauts exchanged some of its instruments and added new blankets to keep Hubble warm. NASA decided on Oct. 1997 to extend its operations from 2005 to 2010.  Hubble's mission in space is to explore the solar system, and measure the age and size of the universe. Hubble's giant telescope searches for our cosmic roots, and charts the evolution of the universe. It also try's to unlock the mysteries of stars, planets, galaxies, and life itself.  Many astronomers ask  ' how high in the sky does the Hubble telescope orbit' and ' what are some of the things the Hubble telescope has seen '.  Achievements of the Hubble  NASA releases Orion Nebula images from the Hubble in June 1994 that confirms the births of planets around newborn stars in space.  In Nov. 1995 telescope images released by NASA of the "Eagle Nebula" showing where stars are born.  NASA releases the "Deep Field" images in Jan. 1996 in which Hubble looks back in time more than 10 billion years. Revealing at least 1,500 galaxies at various stages of development.  New images of "Ant Nebula" in Feb. 2001. How High In The Sky Does The Hubble Telescope Orbit The Hubble telescope has gyroscopes that help determine how far up in the sky the Hubble telescope orbits and where How Much Did The Hubble Telescope Cost For Its Shuttle Servicing Mission The Hubble Telescope's shuttle service mission has been urgently endorsed by the Bahcall and Lanzerotti committees Hubble Latest Images Found Here Hubble latest images are of what may be a newly discovered planet. It's not yet named, but it's probably revolving around a star that is near New Hubble Space Telescope Images Hubble Space Telescope images were first launched in 1990. Since then Hubble has given us many amazing images Hubble Space Telescope Pics Hubble space telescope pics are breathtaking. Nor do you have to be a Hubble astronomer to see them Work of the Hubble Space Telescope Thanks to the Hubble space telescope we know about asteroids, meteors, planets, stars, Quasars, black holes Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Missions The Hubble Space Telescope received its first Service Mission in December 1993 Best Hubble Pics The Hubble picks up, for instance, a heretofore unnoticed black hole, pictures of the Boomerang Nebula and a look so close at the largest asteroid New Hubble Pics The new Hubble telescope pics are of a bright quasar that has no discernible host galaxy What Are Some Of The Things The Hubble Telescope Has Seen One of the things the Hubble telescope has seen that may be among the most noteworthy occurred in June of 2004 Where Is The Hubble Telescope Almost as big as a large school bus, and weighing 14,500 pounds, the Hubble telescope travels around the earth at five miles per second Who Invented The Hubble Telescope His invention of the Hubble telescope proved Einstein's law of inertia that the galaxies had to have been set in motion by something outside themselves Facts About Edwin Hubble He had absorbed with fascination the writing of Jules Verne and his "20,000 Leagues under the Sea"  Hubble telescope to telescope reviews        Brass telescopes    Bosma telescope   Bushnell telescopes     Celestron telescopes   Celestron Astromaster      Celestron Firstscope    Discount telescopes   Dobsonian telescope     Galileo telescopes      Hubble telescope      Meade telescopes    Meade etx telescope     Orion telescopes   Orion SkyView   Orion SkyQuest   Questar telescope    Refracting telescope   Reflecting telescope   Sky and Telescope     Takahashi telescopes      Tasco telescopes     Vixen telescopes       Zhumell telescopes         Make Your Own Telescope       Videos        Astronomy Guide                Home  Telescope Reviews   |    Telescope Partners  |  Site Map | Articles  1  2  3  4 |  Privacy |               This site is protected under both U.S. Federal copyright law and international  treaties.
