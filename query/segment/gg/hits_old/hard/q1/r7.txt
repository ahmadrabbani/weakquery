 Hubble and the Messier objects

 The Hubble Space Telescope and the Messier objects    The famous Hubble Space Telescope is certainly one of the most innovative tools of the astronomers in the 1990s decade; the present author is just now going to predict (and is convinced it deserves) that it might win the title "Photographer of the Decade" for the 1990, as Voyager 2 was nominated for the 1980. Its most spectacular results, together with an open and intelligent public relations policy of the Space Telescope Science Institute, has provided astronomers with a great flood of data and high-quality images, and an outstanding popularity, especially as all the materials get public domain two years after they were obtained.  The Hubble results have revolutionized the state of knowledge in virtually any branch of astronomy -- not that every good result comes from the HST, but as these data are available publicly, they are used if ever possible; from planets, comets, and asteroids to stars, clusters, nebulae, and galaxies, every sort of objects in the sky were investigated, often obtaining most revolutionary results.  Among the most outstanding achievements are observations of objects from Messier's catalog, as those are outstanding representatives of all types of Deep-Sky objects. Because not every author has made his results available to the public domain, we cannot present a comprehensive review here at the moment. But we have tried to link into our catalog some of the most interesting achievements.  There's but one fact on the Hubble Telescope's optics which must be kept in mind: The Hubble telescope has a very long focal length of 190 feet (58 m), and thus a one degree field measures one full meter in the space telescope's focal plane, and one arc minute about 1.7 cm. As its detectors are very much smaller, their fields of view are actually small, so that only photos of small portions of extended objects like most of Messier's catalog can be obtained.  Moreover, the Hubble Space Telescope is not only an astronomical instrument (though the telescope makes up its biggest part) but also a sophisticated  spacecraft . As a spacecraft, it has proven to be very reliable, and was so well operated that the technological operations did virtually never concern the scientific program (at least up to November 1999 when it shut down itself because the fourth of 6 gyroscopes failed - only to be recovered in the third servicing mission, STS-103, in December 1999).  The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was originally projected under the name "Large Space Telescope" (LST) and then simply "Space Telescope" (ST), and developed since the 1970s. Indeed, Hubble is one of the more important in a considerably long list of  orbiting telescopes , or astronomy satellites. It is the second of four in a NASA series of large orbiting observatories, observing in the visible light, together with the Compton Gamma Ray Telescope (CGRO) observing in Gamma-ray light, the  Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) , and the  Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) observing in Infrared.  Here's a list of links to the Hubble observations of Messier objects we could collect with our pages:  M1 :  Jeff Hester and  Paul Scowen of the Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, have obtained  gorgeous images of the Crab Nebula with the Hubble Space Telescope. These images have been reproduced previously in  Sky and Telescope of January 1995, and have provided some new and significant insight into the internal processes of this supernova remnant. Some  views of fine detail have been extracted, which are e.g. suitable for computer screen background. On May 30, 1996,  new studies of the same authors have provided some new insight into the dynamics and changes of the Crab nebula and its pulsar.  Studies of June 2000 of 1995 images reveal details of the Heart of the Crab Nebula.  Multispectral image from October 2006 , created from optical Hubble, X-ray Chandra, and infrared Spitzer exposures.

M32 :  The Nucleus of M32 (1992).  Discovery of blue giant stars near the nucleus of M32 (1999).  M33 : Discovery of the hot young giant stars which excite the huge  emission nebula NGC 595 in M33 to shine. The giant diffuse nebula  NGC 604 in M33 has been photographed with the HST, resolving about 200 hot young massive stars.  M42 : early  pre-repair photos (1993),  Proplyd discovery photos (June 1994),  Mosaic and closeups (November 1995),  Trapezium cluster and Proplyds (January 1997),  OMC 1 molecular cloud (NIC, May 1997),  Trapezium in IR (August 2000),  Proplyds under hot radiation (April 2001)    M45 :  Barnard's Merope Nebula, IC 349 ,  Distance to M45 star (June 2004)  M51 :  Hubble photos of M51, especially of its core ("X" or "y" structure in the core of M51) have been taken before and after its repair in December 1993 by the crew of the Space Shuttle mission STS-61. The HST also recorded  Supernova 1994I in M51 . In 2001,  new images of inner spiral arms of M51 revealed unprecedented detail of spiral arms and dust clouds.

The  active nucleus of this Seyfert II galaxy was revealed by the HST early after its refurbishment in December 1993.   M80 :  Gorgeous image of M80 from the Hubble Heritage Project, showing various types of stars including Blue Stragglers. July 1999.  M81 :  Cepheid variables in M81 (June 1993).

M84 : A  massive central object in M84 was detected in the heart of this Virgo Cluster lenticular when in early 1997 the newly installed Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) was used to investigate this galaxy.  M87 : The  "Smoking Gun" (June 1994), M87's active nucleus, surrounded by an accretion disk. In addition,  R. Mark Elowitz has provided a well-processed HST image of  M87's jet .  M87's jet by HST and NRAO (Oct 1999)  New view of M87's nucleus and jet (Aug 2000). Finally, we have an  older (pre-repair) image of M87 and its jet .   M91 :  M91 spiral arms, with an asteroid captured and discovered on flyby .  M96 : Nial R. Tanvir used the HST to detect and investigate Cepheid variables in this galaxy.  HST image of M96  M100 : This grand-design spiral was among the first objects  photographed after the HST refurbishment by the crew of the Shutle mission STS-61 in December 1993. Moreover, this galaxy is the home of the first  Cepheid variables discovered in the Virgo cluster of galaxies , giving a distance of 50-60 million light years, and a Hubble constant of 80+/-17. However, with the refinement of the distance scale by ESA's astrometric Hipparcos satellite, this value must be refined by about 10 percent, and current estimates for H0 are closer to 67+/-7.   M101 :   M102/NGC 5866 :  Hubble Sees Galaxy on Edge  M104 :  Hubble Mosaic of the Majestic Sombrero Galaxy .  M105 :  Central Massive Dark Object (Jan 1997)  We know of more good Hubble results concerning Messier objects. They are listed below, and we would like to get images and more information for inclusion here:  M95 was a target within the  key project of searching for Cepheid variables in neighboring galaxies . We are still looking for Hubble images of this galaxy though.  M101 : The distance of M101 has been determined as 24 million light years (27 if corrected for Hipparcos data), again with Cepheids (again, within the  H0 Key Project ). A HST image of M101 was in a semi-recent issue of Astronomy magazine.  Also, there were older images which are not yet on SEDS, e.g. in the slide sets of the  Astronomical Society of the Pacific , including more photos of M42, M77, M87, and others which still await being included here.
