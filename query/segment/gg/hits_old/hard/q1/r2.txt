In  1977 ,  Congress votes to fund the project and construction of Hubble Space Telescope begins.        Construction of Hubble Space Telescope  was    completed in 1985 .  The launch of Hubble was delayed due to the 1986 S   pace  S   huttle Challenger  disaster .  Hubble  was launched on the space shuttle on  April 25, 1990   . It was named after   Edwin Hubble  . Within days Hubble  was sending back pictures that  were out of focus. NASA discovered a major flaw in the giant mirror. The giant mirror was too flat on one edge by 1 / 50 th of the width of a single human hair.    In December, 1993, the Space Shuttle Endeavor captured and modified the Hubble Space Telescope         by  adding a camera to correct problems with the telescope's primary mirror.    The s econd servicing mission was in february 1997.  Astronauts  exchanged some of Hubble's instruments and  added  new blankets to keep  Hubble  warm. On October 199  7  ,   NASA decided to extend Hubble's operations from 2005 to 2010. On  November 13, 1999 , a fourth gyroscope on Hubble fails.  The Hubble shuts down to await a repair mission since it can n o longer aim . Space Shuttle mission repairs the Hubble and upgrades it.    Great Achievements of Hubble    June 1994: NASA releases Orion Nebula images that confirm the births of planets around newborn stars. November 1995: NASA releases Eagle Nebula images showing where stars are born. January 1996: NASA releases the "Deep Field" images in which Hubble peers back in time more than 10 billion years. Reveals at least 1,500 galaxies at various stages of development.  February 2001     :   New images "ant nebula".         Hubble Space Telescope History Links:      Hubble Space Telescope Home Site     :        Hubble Space Telescope Greatest Hits (1990-1995)     :       Hubble -Data Image Archive     :       Hubble Space Telescope     :      Educational Materials         Hubble Telescope Photo Gallery     : Lots of Hubble Space Telecope Pictures      References:    Jan Leo Rinnenthal Space Things    :     Take a look at the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) timeline    :     HubbleSite - telescope history    :    Read more in the    HST Home Page   !
