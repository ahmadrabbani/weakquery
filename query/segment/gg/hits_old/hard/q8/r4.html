<p><font size=+1>In<b> the early days of the north, the natives of Alaska
and the Yukon, believed that bears were another species of man. They also
knew that they could be dangerous! So, if they came upon a bear, they would
stop and hold their hands over their heads and say Hello brother bear,
I did not mean to disturb you. I will leave your territory now and let
you in peace. Then they would back away, unharmed. While this is only
legend, it does work! At times.</b></font>
<p><b><font size=+1>A bear will attack a man if they are surprised, feel
they are in danger, wish protect territory or if they have cubs. The best
way to avoid danger is to avoid the bear. But if you can not avoid them,
make sure they see you first.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>As you walk or travel through bear territory, and if
you can not see more then 50 to 100 feet in front of you, call out every
few minutes until you enter a clear area. Some people call out, others
sing, some wear bear-bells. The point being to make a lot of noise. In
most cases the bear will move off the trail and watch you pass. They rarely
look for a confrontation.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>If you see a bear, talk&nbsp; to the bear. Make sure
he sees you.&nbsp; Hold you arms high above your head. this will make you
look like a much bigger animal to him. Continue to talk and slowly back
away. If you run he will chase you.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>If the bear comes for you, climb a tree or drop to
a fetal position. Cover you head and neck with your hands. Keep on your
pack to protect your back. Even if the bear bites you continue to play
dead. Once he realizes that you are not a threat he may&nbsp; leave. If
he does not stop, fight back and make as much noise as possible</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>The best protection from bears is to carry a firearm,
where permitted in bear country. But, still avoid a confrontation, because
bears rarely go down with a single shot and can cover some distance while
wounded.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Another popular defense against bears is to carry <a href="BearSpray1.html">bear
spray</a>. This is capsaicin and related capsaicinoids spray in a compressed
gas container. If you spray the bear he may change his mind or break off
an attack; although some claim it just makes a bear mad. However, in many
areas this is the only protection permitted.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Stay away from bears. Many tourists think they look
cute and like to get close enough to take a picture. Do not be stupid!
All wild animals can be dangerous! Also remember that a female with cubs
is very protective and dangerous and may attack even though you think you
are a safe distance away.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>If you are in a camp, before anything else, put your
food, trash, cooking gear, fuel, soaps and toiletries up a bear pole or
tree. They must be at least 12 feet (4M) to be secure. Then place your
camp a safe distance away.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1>The Black Bear:</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>The black bear is the smallest of the bears. He is
primarily a scavenger, not a hunter. In areas where people are present
he has learned that people can provide food, and he may have lost much
of his fear of man. Use the procedure as above, but if he attacks it is
likely that he has mistaken you for food, or that you have food, or he
could be rogue.&nbsp; Play dead, but if he bites, fight back.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Grizzly Bear:</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>The grizzly bear is indifferent to man. He as no fear
of man and will attack if he feels like it. Sometimes he may not attack
and may run away. The best thing is to avoid him and never surprise him.
If he does attack he rarely sustains his attack, after you play dead. Remember
he is a very big animal and his weight alone can kill.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Polar Bear:</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>The polar bear is the most deadly of all. While his
normal food is seal, they have been known, for centuries, to attack humans.
Until the introduction of firearms, the native people of the north have
lived in fear of them. Many early explorers have told horror stories of
polar bear attacks. These bears are known to stalk and hunt humans. If
you are in polar bear country carry a firearm or avoid the area.
