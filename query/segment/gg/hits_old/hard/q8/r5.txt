But, if you are unable to prevent a bear attack, these tips may help you survive it. Depending on the type of bear--grizzly or black--there are specific actions you can take (or avoid) to help you survive! Follow these steps to learn more. Difficulty: Challenging  Instructions   Things You'll Need  bear pepper spray   Suggest Edits   In Grizzly Country--When a Brown Bear Attacks 1 Hike with bear pepper spray at the ready--easily accessible in a holster on your belt or in a front pocket. If a bear does attack, you will only have seconds to respond.    2 Aim the bear spray toward the attacking bear. When he is in close range--about 40 feet away--begin to fire a cloud in his direction. Hopefully, the super-strength pepper spray will be enough to ward off the attack.    3 Drop to the ground and lie face down if you have no spray, or the bear continues its charge anyway. Cover the back of your neck with your hands and DO NOT move.    4 Play dead. When the bear starts its attack as you lie on the ground, play dead. If he leaves you alone--even for 20 minutes, play dead. The bottom line: yes, play dead. Grizzlies are well-known for attacking until the perceived threat is neutralized; if you're no longer moving, you're no longer a threat.     When a Black Bear Attacks 1 Stand your ground; look big; scream and shout--flail your arms about! Do whatever you can to look aggressive and big. If you have a pack or bike or branch--anything--hold it over your head to look bigger. Black bears will usually bluff one or even several charges.    2 Keep your feet on the ground; do not climb a tree! Black bears are excellent climbers.    3 Fight back once the bear is upon you. Do not go quietly into the night. Think last stand, no holds barred. It is very unlikely things will get to this point, but if they do, use your fists, your feet, sticks and stones; bite his nose off if you have to! He's not going to leave you alone otherwise.         Tips & Warnings   If a grizzly seems to be following or circling you, it may actually be hunting you as prey. Although this is not normal behavior, it may happen with a sick or starving bear. In this case, fight back! Aim for the bear's eyes and face.   Do not run. Running critter equals easy prey! The bear will be on top of you like lightning. There is no chance of outrunning her.

I have used the method of running with my arms raised and yelling at a local female black bear with two cubs who were getting too close to my rabbit pen, and it was very effective. They scattered, and I never saw them again.   natlog  Oct 06, 2008 Some self-defense techniques that work well for human attacks, and would probably work on animals are pinching and twisting the skin on the upper arms and thighs (try it on yourself and see), a palm-heel blow to the end of the nose, and a kick in the groin.
