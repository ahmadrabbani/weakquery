USAID places high priority on preventing abortions through the use of family planning, saving the lives of women who suffer complications arising from unsafe abortion, and linking those women to voluntary family planning and other reproductive health services that will help prevent subsequent abortions. The Helms Amendment No foreign assistance funds may be used to pay for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.  Spanish [PDF, 19KB],  French [PDF, 19KB]  Under the Helms Amendment, post-abortion care – the treatment of injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortion – is permitted.

Rescission of the Mexico City Policy On January 23, 2009, President Obama rescinded the Mexico City Policy.  The Mexico City Policy had required foreign nongovernmental organizations to certify that they will not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning using funds generated from any source as a condition for receiving USAID family planning assistance.  The Mexico City Policy had been in effect from 1985 until 1993, when it was rescinded by President Clinton.  President Bush reinstated the policy in 2001, and it had remained in place since that time.  In rescinding the policy, President Obama directed USAID to immediately waive the policy’s conditions in any current grants; notify current grantees, as soon as possible, that these conditions have been waived; and immediately cease imposing these conditions in any future grants.
