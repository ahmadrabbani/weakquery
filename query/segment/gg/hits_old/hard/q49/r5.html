Denial of contraception to non-menstruating women limits access to family planning in countries where pregnancy tests are unavailable or unaffordable.  Fearing that contraceptives might harm an unrecognized pregnancy, and without sensitive pregnancy tests to rule out pregnancy, providers routinely deny contraceptive services to non-menstruating clients.  In some countries, up to 20% of new presenters for family planning are sent home without services, some of whom may never return.  To address this barrier to access, we used existing international recommendations to develop a new best practice: a simple checklist to help providers rule out pregnancy.  The effectiveness of the checklist has been previously validated in Kenya using dipstick pregnancy tests.  <P>
This presentation describes a quasi-experiment conducted in Senegal, Mali, Guatemala, and Haiti to assess the impact of this new job aid on the proportion of new clients who denied services.  In each country, we collected baseline data in 2-6 clinics for several months to determine the rate of service denial to new, non-menstruating clients.  We then introduced the checklist during a one-day training by a local physician.  We then measured posttest denial rates for several months.  We used one-sided paired T tests to assess differences in each country.  A secondary objectives was to assess whether introduction of the job aid improved provider attitudes towards serving non-menstruating clients.  <P>
Baseline rates of service denial ranged from 4% to 15% of new, non-menstruating clients.  The checklist reduced service denial, in one country from 15% to 1%.  Provider attitudes improved in most clinics.
