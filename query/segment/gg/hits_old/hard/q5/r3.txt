De Seve Theater. The screening will begin at 7PM. For more information on this film, you can goto:  http://www.artcrimefilm.com/ . Press Release: The Fantasia Film Festival is proud to present the World Premiere of Frederick Maheux’s (THÉORIE DE LA RELIGION) highly anticipated ART/CRIME, as part of the Documentaries from the Edge section. By addressing the controversial case of Rémy Couture, ART/CRIME tackles issues surrounding representation of violence, fiction and censorship in cinema and on the Web. Online, the videos and photographic work of special effects artist Rémy Couture caught the attention of web users for their realism and graphic violence, so much so that a complaint was filed with Interpol. The arrest of the artist in 2009 launched a discussion in the media and the film presents not only the opinions of filmmakers and Couture’s live models, but also of the Montreal Police, criminalists and people from academic and political circles such as Robert Morin, Patrick Sénécal, Nacho Cerda, Rodrigo Gudino and Mario Dumont. According to Simon Laperrière, programmer at the Fantasia Festival, ART/CRIME is more than a portrait of the artist. "This necessary and universal work offers an in-depth analysis of critical issues directly affecting the art community as a whole. The Rémy Couture case raised several debates regarding freedom of expression as a moral right. Citing this case as a high-profile and current example of an alarming situation, this brilliantly put together documentary is a reflection as eloquent as it is unavoidable." ART/CRIME will have its world premiere Thursday, July 28 at 7pm at Concordia University’s J.A. de Sève Theatre of Concordia University. Director Frédérick Maheux, Rémy Couture and many speakers featured in the documentary will attend the screening. This will be followed by a vernissage of an exhibition devoted to Rémy Couture’s work at Foufounes Électriques at 9pm. On August 1 at 3pm, Frédérick Maheux and Rémy Couture will take part in the roundtable "Qu’est-ce que le cinéma de l’extrême? " – What is the cinema of the extreme? – at Reggie's Bar at Concordia University. Also appearing as part of this roundtable will be filmmaker FJ Ossang (DHARMA GUNS) and the Cinémathèque française’s director of programming Jean-François Rauger.      0 comments   Post a Comment        Newer Post    Older Post   Home   Subscribe to:  Post Comments (Atom)      Find  TV Memorabilia at affordable prices!
