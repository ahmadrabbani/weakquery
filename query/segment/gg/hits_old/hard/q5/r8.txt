Honeyslug announce the release of Ric Rococo: International Art Thief. Ric Rococo: International Art Thief is a stealth based platform game in which you control Ric Rococo, a master art thief, as he makes his way through 10 themed and increasingly complex art galleries stealing everything from old masters to 20th century surrealists. Along the way, Ric must avoid security cameras and guards, as well as finding ways to access the most secure and valuable paintings to steal. Ric is also ably assisted by his girlfriend and partner-in-crime Nancy, who hovers outside in the Rocococopter waiting to take the pictures from Ric at the nearest open window.       join.me  Share your screen instantly, for free Download Now      More Popular Other Games downloads Angry Birds 8,837  downloads   Angry Birds Free 7,973  downloads   Angry Birds Seasons Free 2,938  downloads   Fruit Ninja 2,726  downloads   Angry Birds Rio 1,348  downloads    See all Other Games downloads        Able2Extract PDF Converter  Convert PDF files to Word and Excel documents.
