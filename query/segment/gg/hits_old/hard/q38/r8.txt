He is completely dependent on the prejudices and fashions of his times, since he never gets to see or hear anything else. And what a person thinks on his own without being stimulated by the thoughts and experiences of other people is even in the best case rather paltry and monotonous. There are only a few enlightened people with a lucid mind and style and with good taste within a century. What has been preserved of their work belongs among the most precious possessions of mankind. We owe it to a few writers of antiquity (Plato, Aristotle, etc.) that the people in the Middle Ages could slowly extricate themselves from the superstitions and ignorance that had darkened life for more than half a millennium. Nothing is more needed to overcome the modernist's snobbishness.           Albert Einstein  ,      1954 (Einstein was very optimistic because he assumed that there are some who read newspapers or books)      The recent developments of methods some derived from remote sensing technology, that enable to read papyri previously assumed to be not "readable" will in the next years increase our knowledge about antiquity. Works of Hesiod, Sophocles and others assumed to be lost could be revealed after the analysis.    καὶ τὸ τῶν Ἑλλήνων ὄνομα πεποίηκε μηκέτι τοῦ γένους ἀλλὰ τῆς διανοίας δοκεῖν εἶναι, καὶ μᾶλλον Ἕλληνας καλεῖσθαι τοὺς τῆς παιδεύσεως τῆς ἡμετέρας ἢ τοὺς τῆς κοινῆς φύσεως μετέχοντα   ς (The name Greek is no longer a mark of a race, but of an outlook, and is accorded to those who share our culture rather than our blood)           Isocrates  ,        Athenian orator, 380 BC.        Panegyricus.      Zeus, Athena and Nike with Hellas the personification of Greece             Hellas (ΕΛΛΑΣ, Ελλάς) is the modern name of Greece and modern Greeks are called Hellenes (Έλληνες), both used also in ancient times. Hellenes describes all the Greeks (derived from the Roman Graeci, a Latin name (probably derived from   Γραικοί    as described by Aristotle  “  ... καὶ οἱ καλούμενοι τότε μὲν Γραικοί, νῦν δὲ Ἕλληνες ”, Meteorologica ) for a small Hellenic tribe (Dorians) from Epirus. Another possibility is that it is derived from Graia in Boeotia; some citizens founded in Italy a colony with cities such as  “Cumae” (assumed to be the first Greek colony in the West) and “Nea Polis” (new city) that now is known as Naples or Napoli. The Greeks actually used their local group names such as Athenians, Macedonians, Spartans, etc. The division of Greece in city state probably was a reason for the success, because each city state had its own specific culture and political system, it was not a monolithic block. There were of course some common elements for all these states such as religion, language (dialects) etc. What was important for Greece were the individual personalities. Hellas was the name of a district in Greece that housed a religious confederacy associated with the Delphic  oracle . Hellen was in  Mythology the son of Deucalion and Pyrrha and his children were Aeolus, Dorus and Xuthus. In the Genesis the Greeks are the descendants of Yavan the son of Noah's son Japheth. Noah the son of Lamech was around 500 years old when Japheth was born! The word Hellas is considered to be derived from Elishah, the son of Yavan (the Hebrew word for Greece).  Name of the Greeks        Αρχαία Ελληνική Τεχνολογία          Ancient Greek Technology (Hellenic and Hellenistic)       Ancient Greek Technology Stamps, Trireme, Odometer, Antikythera mechanism, Piston water pump, Automatic temple gates of Hero of Alexandria     The word “Technology” comes from the Greek word  technikos  which means „artistic, professional“. I was asked what is the difference between an engineer and a scientist? For example Heron of Alexandria or Ctesibius, or Philon of Byzantium are more engineers than scientists like Archimedes and Euclid. What is the difference between a scientist and an engineer? A scientist likes surprises, not so an engineer.          Epistêmê and Technê         First there is practical no original source that describes the technology of ancient Greeks. Archimedes did not consider worth to write about his inventions and the work of Heron is from translations or text written later. We have various indirect sources such as from Vitruvius. A large number of original sources was destroyed by events like the fire of the Alexandria Library, by fanatics, or by natural causes. Devices like the repeating catapult of Dionysius, the planetaria of Archimedes like the Antikythera device, Gigantic ships or steam engines shows that ancient Greeks were not only “theoretical oriented” but that theoretical and applied science are connected together. Only the last 50 years we have a clearer view of the Greek technology and we understand that significant part of this knowledge did not survive. An assumption is that the “aristocratic” Greeks were not interested to gets their hands dirty. But there was a technological advance due to economic reasons or because of the necessity to produce better weapons. And YES! The development of money (probably introduced first by the Lydians) in form of coins and trade was also very important. Trade and the political system was probably one of the main reasons of the rapid development of Science and Philosophy in Greece. With Alexander the Great Greek language became the language of Science.

It played a very important role in the life as news were transmitted there from the barbers who were famous for excessive talking. Once a Spartan was asked by a barber how to cut his hair. His response was : " Silent ". Some say that the first barber shops in Rome were introduced by the Greeks. The barber shops were not very different than today having a large mirror for the clients, a comfortable chair (called  thronos or throne) and various devices such as razors, knives, etc. Probably the most famous barber was Ctesibius of Alexandria. He develop pneumatic devices among which the organ, the first high tech musical instrument. His first invention was a counter-weighted large mirror for the barber shop of his father.    a) Ctesibius of Alexandria     ,         b) The first self controlled system; The Clepsydra of Ctesibius and the toilet            Heron's Steam Engines and other Inventions     ,  Puppet Shows among the Greeks       Van Loon's Law and the lack of industrial revolution in ancient Greece       Everything that can be invented has been invented.

Will anybody compare the idle Pyramids, or those other  useless though much renowned works of the Greeks with these aqueducts, with these many indispensable structures?  Sextus Julius Frontinus   , The Water Supply of the City of Rome        During the Hellenistic period engineers were able to produce spectacular buildings such as the Pharos of Alexandria and the Colossus of Rhodes a statue large as the Liberty Statue in New York. In his trip to the moon (Icaro)Menippus, the first Greek Astronaut, tries to see if the Colossus and the Pharos are visible from outer space (like the Great Wall of China).        The Colossus of Rhodes    ,      The greatest lighthouse ever build, the Pharos of Alexandria    ,  Temple of Artemis      The Tower of Winds      So all this really does exist, just as we learnt at school!  Siegmund Freud I  n the summer of 1904, after prolonged hesitation, Freud suddenly traveled to Athens in the company of his brother Alexander. Once up on the Acropolis, instead of the expected admiration, he was enveloped by a strange feeling of doubt. He was surprised that something he had been learning about at school really exists. He felt divided in two: one person who empirically realized his actual presence on the Acropolis and the other that found it hard to believe, as if denying the reality of the fact.      A disturbance of memory on the Acropolis    Although the beauty is sufficiently humane to weaken us, to stir the deep deposit of mud--memories, abandonments, regrets, sentimental devotions--the Parthenon is separate from all that; and if you consider how it has stood out all night, for centuries, you begin to connect the blaze (at midday the glare is dazzling and the frieze almost invisible) with the idea that perhaps it is beauty alone that is immortal.

My version of  Richard Feynman's remark about Philosophy of Science.            Historic events related to science and technology of Greeks or events that are related to ancient Greeks until the time of the post Greek Scientific revolution that started with Galileo, Newton and others.        Can we trust any timeline? Even the eclipses such as described by Thucydides and others cannot all be reproduced. From possible errors in the translation, manipulation etc inconsistencies when analyzed sometimes enable some (including known mathematicians) to claim even that centuries of history have been invented or did not exist. While I am not happy to find sometimes 10-20 years differences in the dates of some event from various sources it is amusing to read reports that Jesus was born 1559 years later than usually supposed.

A. Neugebauer . About this comment one could write many books. I think it is too negative and typical a problem of some who ignore that pure science requires some “primitive” accumulation of facts. Which places did Democritus visit (some assume that he was in India) and what did he learn there? What did the Greeks learn from others and how important was this knowledge? Is it also true that even today science is the product of a very few and the other millions of scientists are doing just “tabulation physics” filling only tables with numbers? The days of the scientific revolutions like in the early last century seem over but the number of publications increases exponentially. Even with the problem of an extreme specialization from the knowledge accumulated as Aristotle would say “ gignesthai mega ti ”, something great is produced.         Αρχαία Ελληνική Επιστήμη           Athena of Aphaia Temple      Ancient Greek Mathematics          The good Christian should beware of mathematicians and all those who make empty prophecies. The danger already exists that the mathematicians have made a covenant with the devil to darken the spirit and to confine man in the bonds of Hell.        Saint Augustine  (354-430)          Poetry is the only place where the power of numbers proves to be nothing    Odysseas Elytis  Nobel Prize Literature 1979        Greeks like Thales from the Ionian islands around 600 BC visited Egypt and Babylon. They acquired the practical knowledge accumulated over centuries and promoted it into Science. Greeks obtained Geometry as an art of measuring the land from the Egyptians as Herodotus describes. The influence of Greek mathematics continues through the ages. Arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy – pure number, applied number, stationary magnitude, and magnitude in motion respectively – began life in Plato’s  Republic and constituted the quadrivium of sciences up to 1600 AD and later. Eudoxus and Archimedes exhaustion methods were only extended by Cauchy and Weierstrass. The discovery of a proof of Fermat’s last theorem in 1993-4 shows how even current mathematical activity originates in Greek mathematical activity. Also the last years we have some remarkable discoveries analyzing the work of Archimedes and Hipparchus. A characteristic Greek discovery that the square root of 2 is not a rational number is for me one of the best examples that Greeks were interested in true science. One has to think that how surprising it is to discover that you cannot express this number in the form a/b where a and b are integer numbers. You can approach it with an accuracy as good as you want if you choose very large numbers for a and b but whatever you choose it will be never exactly the square root of 2. So there is a special type of numbers, the irrational numbers. For engineering purposes even small numbers for a and b would be enough but the proof of the irrationality of the square root of 2, although so simple, shows what the difference is between engineering and pure science.

Why is this so interesting and why should we consider this problem? Maybe an answer is the story of Charly in "Flowers for Algernon".

Iamblichus ,   Protrepticus 51,11 = Aristotle, Protrepticus Fr. 11 Ross, and Eudemian Ethics 1216a11 = DK 59 A 30.        To what purpose should I trouble myself in searching out the secrets of the stars, having death or slavery continually before my eyes?  Anaximenes, to Pythagoras ... And whereas it has also come to the knowledge of the said Congregation that the Pythagorean doctrine -- which is false and altogether opposed to the Holy Scripture -- of the motion of the Earth and the immobility of the Sun, which is also taught by  Nicolaus Copernicus in De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, and by Diego de Zuñiga On Job, is now being spread abroad and accepted by many... Therefore, in order that this opinion may not insinuate itself any further to the prejudice of Catholic truth, the Holy Congregation has decreed that the said Nicolaus Copernicus, De Revolutionibus Orbium, and Diego de Zuñiga, On Job, be suspended until they are corrected.  From the decree of the Roman Catholic Congregation of the Index condemning "De Revolutionibus", March 5, 1616        Babylonian astronomy was quite advanced after centuries of astronomical observations before the Greeks applied for the first time mathematical models and especially geometry. Who had first an idea of a heliocentric model is not known. In a Sumerian image one can see in the sky something that looks like the sun surrounded by planets. But there are no written comments to my knowledge that support this. Is the central object the sun or a so-called central fire that Pythagoras and his students considered in their cosmological model. It could be possible that Pythagoras had these ideas from his visits in Egypt and other countries. Anaxagoras idea about the sun was considered as a crime and in this way he was treated by the ancient Greeks like the Christians later treated Galilei. Aristarchus developed a heliocentric model but this was not accepted by others because parallax measurements did not support the model. Only in 1836 it was possible to measure the parallax.         The influence of the Greek astronomy was very important. Greeks knew that the Earth is round, some even developed a heliocentric model, the dimensions and distances of the Earth and planets have been measured with the best accuracy that is possible without advanced instruments that were available only later than 1600 AD. Democritus believed that the Milky way is a collection of distant starts and that extraterrestrials exist. There is even some evidence that ancient Greeks knew Newtons inverse square gravity law (or is it more correct to say that Newton knew the ideas of Hipparchus and others?) It is not true that the Greeks believed that the world is small. Democritus, Epicurus, and Metrodorus of Chios among others believed that the world is infinite large and that extraterrestrial life is a consequence of this possible.                    The planet Uranus was discovered in 1781, by William Herschel. a musician who had become both the director of the orchestra at the celebrated spa, Bath, and a first class astronomer. His fame was crowned by the discovery of a new planet, named Uranus after Urania, the muse of astronomy and geometry.         Info      .      About the name of the Planet Uranus around 30000 websites say it was given the name of the Greek God Uranus but 300 websites say it was given the name of Urania. This is unusual as almost all other planets have the names of Gods but Urania is a muse. Nevertheless I think this is true as Herschel was a musician and he knew the muses.

Hellenistic astrology was transmitted to Europe and China indirectly by the Arabs and also to India (even if China and India had a much older astrology prehistory). Astrology was combined with medicine or with chemistry forming the pseudosciences of “iatromathematics” and “alchemy”. Even if it contradicted Christian religion astrology was teached in various Universities (Bologna, Florence, Paris...) and only in the 18 th century the scientific community had turned away from astrology.

The word parasite ( paraseitos, para seito, eating beside ) initially was a religious word describing a person who participated in the meals of Gods and who also helped the priests in religious actions (such as the Apollon Delion cult). In addition a person to whom as honor a meal on public expenses in the Prytaneion in Athens was granted was called a parasite (among these parasites was the father o medicine: Hippocrates of Kos). Also a character in Greek theater is described as “parasite”.

And the earth either takes in this wind from without or from the falling in of foundations, when undermined, into subterranean caverns, thus raising a wind in the imprisoned air. Or they may be due to the propagation of movement arising from the fall of many foundations and to its being again checked when it encounters the more solid resistance of earth.

Liner (   PDF 410 KB   )       Earthquake Theories in Antiquity        Ancient Greek Physics and Meteorology           The word “physics,” comes from the Greek word phusis ( φύσις ). This is usually translated as “nature,” but not nature in the sense that we usually use the word. Aristotle might say that phusis is the internal activity that makes anything what it is. Our word for nature comes from Latin roots having to do with birth and growth, and these associations are present in the Greek word as well. It is in the “nature” of a human embryo to develop into a fetus, to be born, and eventually to become a mature human being. This is the internal activity that makes it what it is. One of Aristotle’s most influential books is entitled simply Phusis, or as it is always translated, Physics.  Alfred. W. Stetz  ,  Beginning with Aristotle, Life, the Universe and Everything          It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that even in 1900 the only new idea to Leucippus's theory was that each chemical element was identified with a separate atomic species.

Nobody does.   Richard Feynman  . QED. The strange theory of light and matter       Ancient Greek physics mainly started with Archimedes and his mechanics of the lever and hydrostatic discoveries. Democritus, Leucippus and other provided the first atomic model. Geometric optics was also developed and atmospheric physics phenomena were studied. Plato's mathematical Universe model using regular polyhedra and triangles as constituents of the world is the first theory of everything (TOE) similar to modern theories such as Superstrings, that are mathematical and symmetry based. Recently a dodecahedron shaped Universe is proposed. Even if some day maybe we will have a theory that explains everything probably it will predict almost nothing as the results depends so sensitive on the initial conditions and whatever our accuracy is we will only be able to make short terms predictions. I think that an ancient Greek said this also before 2000 years:        Because gods perceive future things, men what is happening now, but          wise men perceive approaching things .

This idea was not accepted initially and instead Greeks used states of matter such as fluid, solid, gas, or plasma as a model of matter. Thales started with water, Anaximenes with air, Heraclitus with fire as the basic substance of the Universe. Empedocles added earth and combined these four “elements” together under the action of  eros (love) and  neikos (strife) in a theory that Aristotle further developed. Aristotle was critical about the idea of atoms of Leucippus and Democritus. The idea of the transformation of materials into gold initiated a new discipline “Alchemy” in Alexandria by the Greeks and others. The search of a method to produce gold some say was important for the development of the real science of chemistry. Whether this is true is difficult to judge, were the endless and probably not systematic experiments of amateurs really so important? At least it took more than 1500 years to replace alchemy by chemistry. I will provide soon information of the knowledge of the ancient Greeks about different elements.

Galen was probably the most important Physician of all time and his collected work includes around 20000 pages of text. Only with Vesalius and others around 1600 AD the knowledge again was improved.    How important health is is described in the story of Tithonus and Eos. Eos asks Zeus to make Tithonus immortal but she does not ask that Tithonus should also remain young. The tragic story is that Tithonus gets older and weaker but death is impossible for him. Death is important as the story of Sisyphos describes. Is an eternal life really so important? Is eternal happiness possible?

In the night while we sleep we learn, the brain processes the information that was accumulated during the day. But, when the body is at rest, the soul wakes and stirs and keeps her own house, and carries out herself all the activities of the body. In sleep the body does not feel, but the soul awake knows everything; she sees what is to be seen, hears what has to be heard, walks, touches, grieves, remembers—in a word, all the functions of body and soul alike are performed in sleep by the soul.
