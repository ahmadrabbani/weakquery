(WVLT) – An East Tennessee mayor surrendered to authorities on Wednesday after being indicted on 31 counts of sales tax evasion. Kenneth Lee Burchfield, 44 has been the mayor of Winfield since 2002. He also owns Kenny’s Rowboat, a convenience store in Winfield that is located along the Tennessee-Kentucky border. A Scott County Grand Jury handed down the 31 count indictment against Burchfield on May 4th after examining evidence gathered by the Special Investigations Section of the Tennessee Department of Revenue. The state claims that Burchfield purposely did not report how much sales tax he collected between February 2004 and December 2006. During that time investigators say he kept $47,173.02. Mayor Burchfield is known throughout the region for being a diehard University of Tennessee Volunteers fan. In the past he has made headlines for publically betting rival business owners in the Bluegrass State on the outcome of annual games between the Vols and University of Kentucky Wildcats. He faces up to 62 years in prison and $93,000 in fines if convicted on all 31 counts of tax evasion.        «  Doctor Gets 5 1/2 Years for Tax Evasion  Georgia Bank Officials Indicted for Bank Fraud, Conspiracy & Bribery »       Comments are closed.
