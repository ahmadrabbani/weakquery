The company holds U.S. Patents 6,955,049 and 7,837,411, six foreign patents and has dozens of pending U.S. and foreign patents. Hydro Green Energy focuses on developing new hydropower generation at existing non-powered dams.  At “low-head” hydropower sites (head of less than 30 feet), HGE deploys a “plug-and-play” modular hydropower solution that minimizes the civil work and the time consuming, costly installation process of conventional hydropower. At its project sites, Hydro Green Energy will install a technology designed and developed by the company.  The foundation of HGE’s technology, which is known as “Lock+™” or “Dam+™,” was successfully demonstrated at its hydrokinetic power project in Hastings, MN (FERC P-4306). With its unique approach to hydropower project development, Hydro Green will unlock scores of low-head hydropower sites that have been uneconomic to develop over the past several decades.  Due to Hydro Green Energy’s ability to license and manufacture in parallel, projects could be brought on-line in approximately 18 months. And, while not needed to ensure profitability, its low-impact hydropower projects are eligible for a variety of state and federal renewable energy incentives, increasing their attractiveness. Hydro Green Energy is presently developing 28 hydropower projects in 14 states. The company’s project pipeline will result in the development of nearly 300 MW of clean, renewable energy. The highlights of HGE’s low-head, modular hydropower technology are found below. HGE Technology Installation Point:  Downstream portion of auxiliary, unused lock at USACE Locks and Dams; adjacent to existing non-powered dams or downstream from existing non-powered dams  Turbine:  Hydro Green Energy Proprietary Turbine  Project Capacity Factor:   ~55-90% depending on project site’s flow regime  Operational Mode:  Run-of-River   Control System:  Automated and/or manual    Additional highlights of HGE’s low-head hydropower technology: • Based on over 130 years of hydropower production in the United States. • Based on methods and designs commonly used for fabrication and installation of modular offshore oil, gas and LNG systems. • Independent third party engineering validations of technology and development approach.  • System comprised almost entirely of components that are “off-the-shelf,” dramatically reducing product development, costs and operational uncertainty.  • Power generating system is modular in nature, which simplifies installation and maintenance.  • Use of debris screens to greatly minimize and interactions with project.  • No interference with existing operations of existing dams.
