The FERC issues licenses for terms ranging from 30 to 50 years. Since the 1986 amendments to the Federal Power Act, the FERC must now make licensing decisions by giving the same consideration to environmental quality, fish and wildlife resources, and recreational opportunities as it gives to energy production. The Commission has established formal procedures to ensure that licenses reflect an equitable balance between the need for electricity and all other aspects of the broad public interest. Applications for new hydroelectric projects in Wisconsin are rare. However, the licenses for many existing hydropower facilities in the state have either expired in the last 10 years, or will expire within the next decade. Typically, the traditional application process for license renewal begins 5 years before the expiration date. In Stage I applicants must consult with state and federal resource agencies and other stakeholders to identify the resources that may be affected by the proposed project.  Participants in licensing consultations for hydro projects in Wisconsin have included the Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, the River Alliance of Wisconsin, and others. Information is compiled and studies are conducted over a 2-year period in Stage II consultations to determine whether the impacts are significant and what measures, if any, are necessary to protect the affected resources. Next, a draft license application is prepared and distributed for review. Refinements based on comments from the resource agencies and the public are incorporated into the final license application.  Filing the final application to FERC marks the beginning of Stage III. The Commission may request additional information or studies. Once the application is complete, the FERC asks the resource agencies for their recommendations on license conditions. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), FERC then conducts its environmental analysis and publishes the results in a draft Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement, depending on the significance of the proposed action. FERC may revise its conclusions in the final environmental document. Ideally, the process culminates when FERC issues a new license with adequate provisions to generate power and sustain the river's ecological, recreational, and cultural values. In practice, however, petitions for administrative and judicial review of license orders may extend the process further if the parties are not satisfied with the license conditions. The federal licensing process for hydroelectric projects is often complex, drawn out, confusing, and frustrating, even for those familiar with the regulations. Nonetheless, citizen input is an essential component for sound licensing decisions and for monitoring compliance with license conditions.    Dams needing relicensing in the Upper Chippewa River Basin  In the Upper Chippewa Basin, the current licenses will expire in 2001 for the Flambeau Hydro Station (FERC Project No. 1960) on the Flambeau River near Ladysmith and for the Winter Hydro Project (FERC Project No. 2064) on the East Fork Chippewa River.
