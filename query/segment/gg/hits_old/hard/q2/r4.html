                        A BILL FOR AN ACT
Relating to hydroelectric projects; creating new provisions;
  amending ORS 543.010, 543.017, 543.050, 543.255 and 543.260;
  and repealing ORS 543.510, 543.520 and 543.620.
Be It Enacted by the People of the State of Oregon:
  SECTION 1. ORS 543.010 is amended to read:
  543.010. As used in ORS 543.010 to 543.620:
  (1) 'Actual original cost' includes the sum paid to the state
at the time the application was made for a preliminary permit;
the sum paid or secured to be paid to the state by the applicant
for license at the time such application was made; such sums as
may be paid to the United States or any department thereof; and
such sums as shall have been reasonably and prudently expended in
preliminary investigations, explorations and organization
expenses, as determined by the Water Resources Commission.
  (2) 'Project' means a complete unit, improvement or
development. It includes, among other things, power houses, water
wheels, conduits or pipes, dams and appurtenant works and
structures, storage, diverting or forebay reservoirs connected
therewith, and primary lines transmitting power to the point of
junction with a distributing system, or with any interconnected
primary system, miscellaneous works and structures used in
connection with the unit or any part thereof, rights of way,
lands, flowage rights and all other properties, rights and
structures necessary or appropriate in the use, operation and
maintenance of any such unit.
    { - (3) 'Net investment' is the actual legitimate cost of a
project constructed or acquired under a license as determined by
the Water Resources Commission and according to the
classification of accounts established by the commission, plus
similar cost of permanent additions thereto and betterments
thereof, minus the sum of the following items, if any, earned and
accumulated during the period of the license from earnings in
excess of a fair return on the net investment: - }
    { - (a) Current credit balance to amortization account. - }
    { - (b) Current credit balance to depreciation account. - }
    { - (c) Earnings expended for permanent additions or
betterments. - }
    { - (d) Surplus not appropriated to one of the accounts
specified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this subsection. - }
  SECTION 2. ORS 543.017 is amended to read:
  543.017. (1) In order to carry out the policy set forth in ORS
543.015, the following minimum standards shall apply to any
action of the Water Resources Commission relating to the
development of hydroelectric power in Oregon:
  (a) The anadromous salmon and steelhead resources of Oregon
shall be preserved. The commission shall not approve
 { - activity - }  { +  a water right permit or license for any
new hydroelectric project + } that may result in mortality or
injury to anadromous salmon and steelhead resources or loss of
natural habitat of any anadromous salmon and steelhead resources
except when an applicant proposes to modify an existing facility
or project in such a manner that can be shown to restore, enhance
or improve anadromous fish populations within that river system.
  (b)   { - Any activity related to hydroelectric development - }
 { +  The commission + } shall   { - be consistent - }  { +  not
approve a water right permit or license for any new hydroelectric
project that is inconsistent + } with the provisions of the
Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program providing for the
protection, mitigation and enhancement of the fish and wildlife
resources of the region as adopted by the Pacific Northwest
Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council pursuant to
Public Law 96-501.
  (c) Except as provided in this paragraph, no   { - activity - }
 { +  water right permit or license for a new hydroelectric
project + } may be approved that results in a net loss of wild
game fish or recreational opportunities. If a proposed activity
may result in a net loss of any of the above resources, the
commission may allow mitigation if the commission finds the
proposed mitigation in the project vicinity is acceptable.
Proposed mitigation which may result in a wild game fish
population or the fishery the wild game fish population provides,
being converted to a hatchery dependent resource is not
acceptable mitigation. A water dependent recreational opportunity
must be mitigated by another water dependent recreational
opportunity. Mitigation of water dependent recreational
opportunities which, in the judgment of the commission, are of
statewide significance with a recreational opportunity that is
readily available on other waters of this state is not acceptable
mitigation. In deciding whether mitigation is acceptable, the
commission shall consult with other local, state and federal
agencies.
  (d) Other natural resources in the   { - project - }
vicinity { +  of a new or existing project, + } including water
quality, wildlife, scenic and aesthetic values, historic,
cultural and archaeological sites, shall be maintained or
enhanced. No   { - activity - }  { +  water right permit or
license for a new hydroelectric project + } may be approved
which, in the judgment of the commission after balancing gains
and losses to all affected natural resources, may result in a net
loss of natural resources. In determining whether the proposed
 { - activity - }  { +  new hydroelectric project + } may result
in a net loss of natural resources, the commission may consider
mitigation if the commission determines the proposed mitigation
 { - in the project vicinity - }  is acceptable. Mitigation may
include appropriate measures considered necessary to meet the net
loss standard. In determining whether mitigation is acceptable
the commission shall consult with appropriate state, federal and
local agencies.
  (e) In determining whether it is in the public interest to
allocate water for a proposed  { + new + } hydroelectric
development, the commission shall consider present and future
power needs and shall make a finding on the need for the power.
For a hydroelectric project with a nominal electric generating
capacity of 25 megawatts or more, the Water Resources Commission
shall consider any recommendation by the Energy Facility Siting
Council. The Energy Facility Siting Council's recommendation
shall be based solely on information contained in the hearing
record of the Water Resources Commission. The commission's order
on the proposed hydroelectric development shall describe the
Energy Facility Siting Council's recommendations on the need for
the power. If the commission's decision on the need for power is
contrary to the Energy Facility Siting Council's recommendation,
the commission's order shall explain the commission's failure to
follow the recommendation of the Energy Facility Siting Council.
The commission also shall consult with the Energy Facility Siting
Council on other matters within the expertise of the Energy
Facility Siting Council.
  (2) The commission shall adopt all necessary rules to carry out
the policy set forth in ORS 543.015 and to implement the minimum
standards set forth in subsection (1) of this section. In the
absence of implementing rules,   { - any action of the commission
relating to hydroelectric development - }  { +  the approval of
the commission of any water right or license for a new
hydroelectric project + } shall comply with the standards as set
forth in this section.
  SECTION 3. ORS 543.050 is amended to read:
  543.050. The Water Resources Commission may:
  (1) Issue preliminary permits, as provided in ORS 543.210 to
543.250, to any person qualified to become a licensee.
  (2) Issue licenses, as provided in ORS 543.260, to citizens of
the United States, associations of citizens, or private
corporations organized under the laws of the United States or any
state of the United States, to appropriate, initiate, perfect,
acquire and hold the right to the use of waters within the state,
including waters over which the state has concurrent
jurisdiction, and to construct, operate and maintain dams,
reservoirs, power houses, conduits, transmission lines, and all
other works and structures necessary or convenient for the use of
the waters in the generation and utilization of electricity.
  (3) Conduct investigations and collect information the
commission considers necessary or useful for the purposes of ORS
543.010 to 543.620 and cooperate with the Federal Government and
adjoining states concerning all such matters, particularly with
reference to waters forming the boundary between this state and
another state.
  (4) Prescribe the forms of all accounts, records and memoranda
to be kept by licensees under ORS 543.010 to 543.620  { - , and
make all rules and regulations with respect thereto deemed
necessary or expedient. The Water Resources Commission shall
employ and promulgate standard regulations for accounting,
determination of depreciation, amortization, net investment, rate
of return and allocation of earnings, etc., and a certified copy
of such accounting data shall be filed with the Water Resources
Commission from time to time, as may be required by the
commission - } .
  (5) Examine at any time all accounts, books of account and
documents and data related to the business of a licensee under
ORS 543.010 to 543.620; and require a licensee to submit,
whenever required by the commission, reports and statements under
oath containing information as to assets, liabilities,
capitalization, gross receipts, interest and dividend
requirements, interest due and paid, amortization and other
reserves, net investment, cost of any project constructed,
maintained or operated, in whole or in part, cost of maintenance,
operation, renewals, replacements, cost of production,
transmission, distribution and sale of electricity, and other
data as the commission may require.
  (6) Perform all acts, exercise all powers and issue all orders
which, in the judgment and discretion of the commission, are
necessary to effectuate the purposes of ORS 543.010 to 543.620.
  SECTION 4. ORS 543.255 is amended to read:
  543.255. (1) Whenever the Water Resources Commission receives
an application to appropriate water for { +  a new + }
hydroelectric
  { - power - }  { +  project + } under ORS 537.140 to 537.320 or
for a hydroelectric permit or license under ORS 543.010 to
543.620, the commission shall determine whether the impacts of
the project would be cumulative with:
  (a) Impacts of other proposed hydroelectric projects for which
an application is pending before the commission; or
  (b) Existing hydroelectric projects in the same river basin.
  (2) If the commission determines that there is no possibility
that the hydroelectric projects proposed in pending applications
or existing projects may have cumulative effects, the commission
shall issue an order setting forth the commission's determination
that there are no cumulative effects and the commission's
decision that consolidated review is not required.
  (3) If the commission determines that pending applications or
existing projects may have cumulative effects, the commission
shall conduct a consolidated review before approving any
application in the affected river basin. A consolidated review
process shall be conducted as a contested case hearing under the
applicable provisions of ORS 183.310 to 183.550 and shall include
a study of the individual and cumulative effects of proposed
hydroelectric projects for which applications are pending before
the commission and existing hydroelectric projects. In its final
order on an application, the commission shall include its
findings on cumulative impacts. The findings of the commission
under this section must be sufficient to support the commission's
decision to approve or deny an application.
  (4) Any application for a project in the same river basin filed
after the commission begins a consolidated review contested case
hearing shall not be reviewed until the commission has issued
final findings on cumulative effects for all projects included in
the consolidated review proceeding.
  (5) At the request of an applicant for a permit to appropriate
water for  { + a new + } hydroelectric   { - purposes - }  { +
project + } under ORS 537.140 to 537.320 or for a permit or
license under ORS 543.010 to 543.620, the commission may
immediately upon receiving such application begin the
consolidated review proceeding under subsection (3) of this
section.
  SECTION 5. ORS 543.260 is amended to read:
  543.260. (1) A license may be issued by the Water Resources
Commission to any qualified   { - licensee - }  { +  person + }
for a period not exceeding 50 years. { +  If the project is
subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, the term shall be concurrent with and expire upon
expiration of the federal license for the project. + } Each
license shall be conditioned upon acceptance by the licensee of
all the terms and conditions of ORS 543.010 to 543.620, and such
further terms and conditions as the commission may prescribe, not
inconsistent with those sections. All such terms and conditions,
and their acceptance by the licensee, shall be expressed in the
license. A license may be terminated for the reasons and in the
manner provided in ORS 543.010 to 543.620. The form of license
containing all the terms and conditions may be set forth in the
preliminary permit.
  (2) The commission may deny any application for a license if it
appears that the applicant has failed to comply substantially
with the terms and conditions of the preliminary permit or,
notwithstanding the commission has issued a preliminary permit,
if in the judgment of the commission the project is unfeasible or
the public interest requires the denial thereof.
  (3) A municipal corporation or people's utility district shall
be given preference on any project in the issuance of a license,
upon condition that the municipal corporation or people's utility
district exercising such preference right shall be required to
reimburse the holder of a preliminary permit for all reasonable
actual expenditures made by the holder upon the project described
or referred to therein.
  SECTION 6.  { + (1) Not later than 60 days after the effective
