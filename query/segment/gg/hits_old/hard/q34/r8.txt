So what can you do to protect your eyes from the sun and keep your eyes healthy all year long?  I’ve got a few tips:      Look stylish and protect your eyes at the same time. Sunglasses can be much more than a fashion accessory - they provide protection from the sun’s ultraviolet rays. You can reduce your risk for some eye conditions by wearing sunglasses that block out nearly 100 percent of both UV-A and UV-B radiation. UV damage can add up over time, so make sure to start encouraging your kids to wear shades too! Be careful of those sunglasses that are only a few dollars - cheap glasses usually offer limited protection.      Bring vision "power foods" to your next potluck.   We used to think it was just carrots that helped with vision.  Now we know that a diet that includes daily fruits and vegetables like oranges, carrots and dark leafy greens, and fish like salmon and tuna, are important for keeping your eyes healthy. Key nutrients to include in a healthy eye diet include vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, lutein and omega-3 fatty acids.     Start a conversation.  If your next vacation or BBQ includes family, take some time to ask about their eye health history. Many eye conditions are actually hereditary, so knowing what other members of your family have experienced with their eyes can help you discover whether you are at higher risk for certain eye problems.     Get moving! Just like our heart and other organs of the body, our eyes need good circulation and plenty of oxygen to perform at their best. Exercise helps get your blood flowing to provide essential nutrients to your eyes. Another benefit of regular exercise? It can help keep our weight in the normal range - reducing the risk of diabetic eye disease.     Move away from the computer .  We strain our eyes by looking at screens for hours at a time both at work and at home. You can reduce computer-use eye strain by moving your computer screen at least two feet away from you, making sure your work area is properly lit to reduce any glare and taking regular breaks from looking at the screen.     Say no to smoking.  Smoking is bad for your eyes  and  the rest of your body. Period. Research has shown that smoking is linked to an increased risk of conditions that cause blindness, including cataracts, macular degeneration and optic nerve damage.      If you follow these tips and get a yearly eye exam, you’ll be well on your way to seeing good eye health!

I find sunglasses very essential during the summer. It is where UV rays can damage our eyes even without we knowing it.

Does anyone have a remedy or anything that will help.   Posted by: mobile58ron |  August 05, 2011 at 03:26 PM    This is a well laid out plan to better eyes. Thanks. Sunglasses are your first line of defense for eyes, and good ones should be worn in the sun everyday. Don't forget to get a prescription pair if needed. The less you squint, the lower the opportunity for crows feet.    Posted by:  Melissa S |  July 27, 2011 at 11:54 AM      Post a comment If you have a TypeKey or TypePad account, please  Sign In .
