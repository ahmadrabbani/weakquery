UV rays from the sun, although unseen by the naked eye, can cause temporary or permanent damage to one's eyes. The first stage often produces the start of irreversible eye damage. Taking care of your eyes should be a top concern all year round. However, during the summer, UV radiation is three times greater than in the winter. It is suggested to avoid excessive sun exposure to your eyes between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. as the sun is the strongest during these times. Never try to look directly at the sun directly, especially at an eclipse. It can lead to solar retinopathy disease and causes damage to the eye's retina from solar radiation, hence damaging the eyes or the vision temporarily.  Sunglasses: The longer you expose your eyes to sunlight the greater the risk. Sunglasses provide one of the best sources of UV protection. In order to properly protect your eyes, choose sunglasses that are high-quality as these typically provide at least 95 percent UV protection. Use large-lens sunglasses that fit close to your eyes because they will offer proper protection. Those that block visible blue light are even safer. Some sunglass frames offer more protection than others. Since rays can hit your eyes from the sides of the glasses, consider buying wraparound frames or frames with very wide frames.  Choose a lens that blocks maximal percentages of transmissible light, but no more than 90-92 percent of light because higher tints do not protect you from UV rays and can affect your ability to see correctly. Always choose lighter colored lenses which cut glare without changing the color of what you see. Extremely dark colors can distort your vision. Lenses such as photo-chromic lenses are far better options to choose as these lenses darken upon exposure to UV light. Do not look directly at the sun even with your sunglasses on. Doing so may cause permanent eye damage. Kids should wear a pair of shatter- or impact-resistant lenses as they provide the same level of protection as adult sunglasses do while protecting against playtime mishaps.  Wear a Hat: A wide-brimmed hat or cap will block about half of your UV ray exposure. The simple combination of a hat and sunglasses can give you all the protection you need to protect those precious eyes.
