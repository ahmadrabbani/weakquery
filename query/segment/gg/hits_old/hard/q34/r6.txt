Like the skin, the eyes can also be sunburned, which can cause blurred vision, redness, tearing and temporary vision loss. Exposure to UV rays may also contribute to the development of longterm vision conditions, such as cataracts, macular degeneration and, in some cases, skin cancer on and around the eyelids.  Light intensifies as it passes through the eyes and is 22 times stronger at the outer edges of the eyes and eight times stronger at the inner edges of the eyes. These are the most common places for pterygium (a thin tissue over the white part of the eye) and cataracts to develop, both of which are associated with chronic UV exposure.    Children’s eyes are especially sensitive to UV exposure, and it’s never too early for them to wear proper sun protection. In a study published in Review of Optometry, vision changes due to UV damage were found in children as young as age 9. What’s more, 71 percent of parents reported they do not ensure that their children wear sunglasses outdoors, according to a recent survey conducted by the American Optometric Association. To protect the eyes from sun damage throughout the year, consider the following. Wear protective eyewear that blocks 99 to 100 percent of UVA and UVB rays. Consider adaptive eyeglass lenses which automatically adjust the level of darkness to help reduce distracting glare, minimize eye fatigue and block 100 percent of UV rays. Wear a wide-brimmed hat and use plenty of sunscreen. Visit doctors regularly for health checkups, including an eye doctor for a comprehensive eye exam.
