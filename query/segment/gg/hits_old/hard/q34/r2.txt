But did you know UV and other radiation from the sun also can harm your eyes? Extended exposure to the sun's UV rays has been linked to eye damage, including  cataracts ,  macular degeneration ,  pingueculae and pterygia and  photokeratitis that can cause temporary vision loss. And new research suggests the sun's high-energy visible (HEV) radiation  also called " blue light "  may increase your long-term risk of macular degeneration. People with low blood plasma levels of  vitamin C and other  antioxidants especially appear at risk of retinal damage from HEV radiation. Dangers of Ultraviolet Radiation to Your Eyes To protect your eyes from harmful solar radiation,  sunglasses should block 100 percent of UV rays and also absorb most HEV rays. Frames with a close-fitting  wraparound style provide the best protection because they limit how much stray sunlight reaches your eyes from above and beyond the periphery of your sunglass lenses. To protect your eyes outdoors, wear broad-brimmed hats and wraparound sunglasses with 100 percent UV protection. While many people refer to ultraviolet radiation as UV light, the term technically is incorrect because you cannot see UV rays. The three categories of invisible high-energy UV rays are: UVC rays. These are the highest-energy UV rays and potentially could be the most harmful to your eyes and skin. Fortunately, the atmosphere's ozone layer blocks virtually all UVC rays.   But this also means depletion of the ozone layer potentially could allow high-energy UVC rays to reach the earth's surface and cause serious UV-related health problems. UVC rays have wavelengths of 100�280  nanometer (nm). UVB rays. These have slightly longer wavelengths (280�315 nm) and lower energy than UVC rays. These rays are filtered partially by the ozone layer, but some still reach the earth's surface.   In low doses, UVB radiation stimulates the production of  melanin (a skin pigment), causing the skin to darken, creating a suntan.   But in higher doses, UVB rays cause sunburn that increases the risk of skin cancer. UVB rays also cause skin discolorations, wrinkles and other signs of premature aging of the skin. UVA rays. These are closer to visible light rays and have lower energy than UVB and UVC rays. But UVA rays can pass through the  cornea and reach the  lens and  retina inside the eye.   Overexposure to UVA radiation has been linked to the development of certain types of cataracts, and research suggests UVA rays may play a role in development of macular degeneration.  Ultraviolet (UV) rays are higher in energy and do not fall within the realm of visible light, as shown here. In the electromagnetic spectrum, radio waves have the lowest energy, and gamma rays have the highest energy. Various eye problems have been associated with overexposure to UV radiation. As an example, UVB rays are thought to help cause pingueculae and pterygia. These growths on the eye's surface can become unsightly and cause corneal problems as well as distorted vision. In high short-term doses, UVB rays also can cause photokeratitis, a painful inflammation of the cornea. "Snow blindness" is the common term for severe photokeratitis, which causes temporary vision loss usually lasting 24-48 hours. The risk for snow blindness is greatest at high altitudes, but it can occur anywhere there is snow if you don't protect your eyes with UV-blocking sunglasses. Because the cornea appears to absorb 100 percent of UVB rays, this type of UV radiation is unlikely to cause cataracts and macular degeneration, which instead are linked to UVA exposure. HEV Radiation Risks As the name suggests, high-energy visible (HEV) radiation, or blue light, is visible. Although HEV rays have longer wavelengths (400�500 nm) and lower energy than UV rays, they penetrate deeply into the  eye and can cause retinal damage. According to a European study published in the October 2008 issue of  Archives of Ophthalmology , HEV radiation  especially when combined with low blood plasma levels of vitamin C and other  antioxidants  is associated with the development of macular degeneration. Outdoor Risk Factors Anyone who spends time outdoors is at risk for eye problems from UV radiation. Risks of eye damage from UV and HEV exposure change from day to day and depend on a number of factors, including:  News About UV Light Packing for a Trip? New iPhone App Won't Let You Forget Your Sunglasses    June 2011  The Vision Council has released a free iPhone app called PackLists that helps you create a quick list of the clothes and other things you'll need for a trip. It lets you make lists for yourself and for others, and when you enter your travel dates and destination it also includes information on the current UV exposure levels in that city. The idea behind the app is to remind you to bring your sunglasses when you travel. The app also presents information about harmful UV light that you might not have known before. PackLists is available for the iPhone, the iPod Touch and the iPad.  You can preview it here.       Geographic location. UV levels are greater in tropical areas near the earth's equator. The farther you are from the equator, the smaller your risk. Altitude. UV levels are greater at higher altitudes. Time of day. UV and HEV levels are greater when the sun is high in the sky, typically from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Setting. UV and HEV levels are greater in wide open spaces, especially when highly reflective surfaces are present, like snow and sand. In fact, UV exposure can nearly double when UV rays are reflected from the snow. UV exposure is less likely in urban settings, where tall buildings shade the streets. Medications. Certain medications, such as tetracycline, sulfa drugs, birth control pills, diuretics and tranquilizers, can increase your body's sensitivity to UV and HEV radiation.  Surprisingly, cloud cover doesn't affect UV levels significantly. Your risk of UV exposure can be quite high even on hazy or overcast days. This is because UV is invisible radiation, not visible light, and can penetrate clouds. Measuring Ultraviolet Rays In the United States, the risk for UV exposure is measured using the UV Index. Developed by the NWS and EPA, the UV Index predicts each day's ultraviolet radiation levels on a simple 1 to 11+ scale. In addition to publishing the UV Index daily, the EPA also issues a UV Alert when the level of solar UV radiation that day is expected to be unusually high.   UV Protection Recommendations UV Index Risk Level Recommendations  2 or less Low 1. Wear sunglasses.  2. If you burn easily, use sunscreen with an SPF* of 15+.  3 - 5 Moderate 1. Wear sunglasses.  2. Cover up and use sunscreen.  3. Stay in the shade near midday, when the sun is strongest.  6 - 7 High 1. Wear a hat and sunglasses.  2. Cover up and use sunscreen.  3. Reduce time in the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.  8 - 10 Very high 1. Wear a hat and sunglasses.  2. Cover up and use sunscreen.  3. Minimize sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.  11+ Extreme 1. Wear a hat and sunglasses.  2. Apply sunscreen (SPF 15+) liberally every two hours.  3. Try to avoid sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.  *SPF = sun protection factor  Information based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards.     If you're wondering how high today's UV light levels are where you live, here's a handy  UV index map for the United States . Kids Need UV Protection Even More Than Adults  These rubber frames are soft and flexible, so your kids won't break them, and the polycarbonate lenses offer 100 percent UV protection. RKS Flex, by Real Kids Shades. The risk of damage to our eyes and skin from solar UV radiation is cumulative, meaning the danger continues to grow as we spend time in the sun throughout our lifetime. With this in mind, it's especially important for kids to protect their eyes from the sun. Children generally spend much more time outdoors than adults. In fact, experts say nearly 50 percent (or more) of our lifetime exposure to UV rays may occur by age 18, given that many children spend significantly more time outdoors than the average adult. Therefore, make sure your kids' eyes are protected from the sun with good quality sunglasses. Also, encourage your child to wear a hat on sunny days to further  reduce UV exposure . Sunglasses That Protect Your Eyes From UV and HEV Rays To best protect your eyes from the sun's harmful UV and HEV rays, always wear good quality sunglasses when you are outdoors.  News About UV Light White Paper Explores Dangers of UV Light to Our Nation's Eyes    March 2011  "UV and Our Nation's Vision" is a new white paper that summarizes a congressional briefing last fall on the dangers of UV light to our nation's vision. The white paper contains lots of useful information for employers, teachers and parents about how and why we need to protect our eyes and our children's eyes from the sun. The white paper outlines the economic impact of eye diseases related to UV light exposure, such as macular degeneration and cataracts. It also presents facts on demographic groups in the United States who are at particular risk for these eye problems. The white paper was produced by Prevent Blindness America and Transitions Optical, and  you can download it here .      Look for sunglasses that block 100 percent of UV rays and that also absorb most HEV rays. Your  optician can help you choose the best sunglass lenses for your needs. To protect as much of the delicate skin around your eyes as possible, try at least one pair of sunglasses with large lenses or a close-fitting wraparound style. Depending on your outdoor lifestyle, you also may want to explore  performance sunglasses or  sport sunglasses . The amount of UV protection sunglasses provide is unrelated to the color and darkness of the lenses. A light amber-colored lens can provide the same UV protection as a dark gray lens. Your optician can verify that the lenses you choose provide 100 percent UV protection. But for HEV protection, color  does matter. Most sunglass lenses that block a significant amount of blue light will be bronze, copper or reddish-brown (see  lens tint guide ). Again, your optician can help you choose the best "blue-blocking" lenses. In addition to sunglasses, wearing a wide-brimmed hat on sunny days can reduce your eyes' exposure to UV and HEV rays by up to 50 percent. More Tips About Sunglasses and UV Exposure Many misconceptions exist about the right sun protection for your eyes. Keep these tips in mind: This UV Index devised by the Environmental Protection Agency and National Weather Service provides a color-coded warning system to alert people to the dangers of being outdoors on certain days. Not all sunglasses block 100 percent of UV rays. If you're unsure about the level of UV protection your sunglasses provide, take them to your  eye doctor or optician for an evaluation. Many eye care professionals have instruments such as spectrophotometers that can measure the amount of visible light and UV radiation your lenses block. Almost all sunglasses block a portion of HEV rays, but some tints block more blue light than others. Blue-blocking sunglass lenses usually are bronze, copper or reddish-brown in color. Remember to wear sunglasses even when you're in the shade. Although shade reduces your UV and HEV exposure to some degree, your eyes still will be exposed to UV rays reflected from buildings, roadways and other surfaces. Sunglasses are important especially in winter, because fresh snow can reflect 80 percent of UV rays, nearly doubling your overall exposure to solar UV radiation. If you ski or snowboard, choosing the right  ski goggles is essential for adequate UV protection on the slopes. Even if your  contact lenses block UV rays, you still need sunglasses. UV-blocking contacts shield only the part of your eye under the lens. UV rays still can damage your  conjunctiva and other tissues not covered by the lens. Wearing sunglasses protects these delicate tissues and the skin around your eyes from UV damage. If you have dark skin and eyes, you still need to wear sunglasses. Although your dark skin may give you a lower risk of skin cancer from UV radiation, your risk of eye damage from UV and HEV rays is the same as that of someone with fair skin.  You need not fear the outdoors and sunny days, as long as you are equipped with the right eye and skin protection to reduce your UV exposure.
