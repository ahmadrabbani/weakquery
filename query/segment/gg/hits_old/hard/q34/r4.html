<h1>Florida Blind Services</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Florida Division of Blind Services.</p>
<p><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> To ensure blind and visually impaired Floridians have the tools, support and opportunity to achieve success.</p>
<p><strong>Vision Statement:</strong> In partnership with others, create a barrier free environment in the lives of Floridians with visual disabilities.</p>
<h2>Overview of Services</h2>
<h3>Blind Babies Program</h3>
<p>The <a href="/blind-babies/index.php">Blind Babies Program</a> provides community-based early-intervention education to children  from birth to five years of age who are blind or visually impaired, and to  their parents, families, and through community-based provider organizations.</p>

  <h3>Children's Program</h3>
  <p>The <a href="/children/index.php">Children's  Program</a> serves children who are blind from five years of age through  transition to the Vocational Rehabilitation Program. This program supplements  services already offered by the school system to foster the child's learning  and ability to function independently. The child's parents, guardian, and  family members should be an integral part of the program in order to foster  independence.</p>

  <h3><a name="trans" id="trans">Transition Program</a></h3>
  <p><img src="images/transition-01.jpg" alt="Commissioner John Winn with Students" width="232" height="160" class="left"/>The goal of the <a href="/transition/index.php">Transition Program</a> is to assist young people in meeting their  future employment goals through transitioning from school to work or from school to a higher educational program.&nbsp; Students must have a visual impairment in both eyes and require vocational   rehabilitation services to prepare for employment. Transition services are generally  provided through the Vocational Rehabilitation Program. However, they could  also be provided through the Children's Program. In either case, the student  will have a Plan of Services. The types of services to be provided through  Blind Services are normally incorporated into the student's Individual  Education Plan as well. The final goal is to ensure that your child can be an independent adult.</p>

  <h3>Independent Living Services</h3>
  <p><a href="/independent-living/index.php">Independent Living  Services</a> are provided to enable individuals who are blind or severely  visually impaired to live more independently in their homes and communities with  a maximum degree of self-direction. Successful outcomes enable individuals to  live more independently in their community and/or transition to the working  world.</p>

  <h3>Vocational Rehabilitation Services</h3>
  <p><a href="/vr-services/index.php">Vocational Rehabilitation Services</a> are provided to assist blind and visually impaired individuals seeking employment.&nbsp; Qualified individuals must have a  bilateral visual impairment which constitutes or results in a substantial impediment to employment and needs services to prepare for, enter, engage in, or  retain gainful employment. Successful outcomes lead to achievement of employment goals.</p>

  <h3>Employer Services</h3>
  <p>Information services are provided to <a href="/employer/index.php">employers</a> who need to know how to  make a job accessible to an employee with a visual impairment.&nbsp; Employers  seeking to hire a qualified employee can also contact us for this information  as well.</p>

  <h3>Business Enterprise  Services</h3>
  <p>The <a href="/bbe/index.php">Business  Enterprise Program</a> provides job opportunities in the food service sector  for eligible blind persons under the Randolph-Sheppard Act. Job opportunities  include: Snack Bar, Cafeteria, Highway Vending Machines, or Non-Highway Vending.</p>
  <h3>The Rehabilitation Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired </h3>
  <p>The <a href="/rehab-center/index.php">Rehabilitation Center for the Blind and   Visually Impaired</a> is a place where people who are blind can reside temporarily   while they learn to lead productive, self-sufficient lives.  The Rehabilitation   Center program incorporates instruction in a variety of independence skills, as   well as counseling, including home management, cooking, cleaning, personal care,   labeling, orientation and mobility, Braille, access computer technology, home   repairs, adaptation to blindness and many other skills that contribute to   independence and the confidence to seek the highest level of employment   possible.</p>

  <h3>Braille and Talking Books Library</h3>
  <p>The Florida Division of Blind Services also  provides information and reading materials needed by individuals residing in Florida who are unable  to use standard print because of a visual, physical, or reading disability.  These services are provided through its <a href="/library/index.php">Bureau of Braille and Talking Books Library</a>.</p>
