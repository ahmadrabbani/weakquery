Hispanics accounted for nearly half of all immigrants to this country between April 1, 2000, and July 1, 2003. ( Photo by Lloyd Wolf for the U.S. Census Bureau.)      It is not uncommon to walk down the streets of an American city today and hear Spanish spoken. In 1950 fewer than 4 million U.S. residents were from Spanish-speaking countries. Today that number is about 45 million. About 50 percent of Hispanics in the United States have origins in Mexico. The other 50 percent come from a variety of countries, including El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Colombia. Thirty-six percent of the Hispanics in the United States live in California. Several other states have large Hispanic populations, including Texas, New York, Illinois, and Florida, where hundreds of thousands of Cubans fleeing the Castro regime have settled. There are so many Cuban Americans in Miami that the Miami Herald, the city's largest newspaper, publishes separate editions in English and Spanish.   The term Hispanic was coined by the federal government in the 1970's to refer to the people who were born in any of the Spanish-speaking countries of the Americas or those who could trace their ancestry to Spain or former Spanish territories. Obviously, this represents a wide variety of countries and ethnic groups with different social, political and emotional experiences. Most Hispanics see themselves in terms of their individual ethnic identity, as Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Cuban, etc. instead of members of the larger, more ambiguous term Hispanic or Latino.   The Newcomers Myth   People think of Hispanics as the latest, most recent group to enter the so called "melting pot". This erroneous perception is mostly due to the media attention given to Hispanic groups in the 1980's, after the Bureau of the Census published their 1980 results. Their report revealed that Hispanics were the fastest growing group in the U.S., soon to become the largest minority group. People associated the growth with immigration, ignoring the long history of Hispanics in the United States. Hispanic heritage in the U.S. goes back a long time. When Plymouth was founded in 1620, Santa Fe was celebrating its first decade and St. Augustine its 55th anniversary. Spanish settlements developed in the southwest of today's U.S. and also in the Gulf coast and the Florida peninsula. Some Latinos can trace their ancestors back to those days.     Other Hispanic groups, like the Puerto Ricans, did not migrate into the U.S. but instead were absorbed into it during the American expansions of the late 19th century. Puerto Ricans were granted American citizenship in 1917. Economic depressions and two world wars forced many Puerto Ricans to migrate from the island in search for better opportunities. Their current political situation still confuses many who think of Puerto Rico as a foreign country.       Hispanic Population 2000.

(America.gov, July 2010)     Hispanics, the Largest U.S. Minority, Enrich the American Mosaic  . By Louise Fenner Hispanics, the largest and fastest-growing minority in the United States, are changing U.S. society and culture. Latinos fill several top positions in the U.S. government, and more and more products, advertising and media are directed at Hispanic consumers.    (America.gov, Sept. 22, 2009)     U.S. Minority Population Continues to Grow.   By David Minckler Slightly more than one-third of the population of the United States -- 34 percent -- claims 'minority' racial or ethnic heritage, a jump of 11 percent from 2000.     The May 1, 2008 Census Bureau report , covering estimates for the year 2007, confirms that the U.S. population is becoming increasingly diverse. Hispanics and Asians continue to be the two fastest-growing minorities. There are 45.5 million Hispanics living in the United States, accounting for 15 percent of the U.S. population.

By Lauren Monsen When the Cinco de Mayo ('fifth of May') holiday is observed in the United States, the annual festivity honors the Mexican heritage of a growing number of U.S. citizens, with a focus on Mexico's distinctive cuisine, folk dances, colorful costumes and mariachi music.
