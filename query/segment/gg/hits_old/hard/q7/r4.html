<p>The six Persian Gulf states of the Arabian Peninsula-- Bahrain,
        Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE--formed the GCC in May
        1981 with the aim of &quot;co-ordination, integration, and co-operation
        among the member-states in all fields.&quot; Although none of the
        committees initially established dealt with security, the final
        communiqu√© of the first meeting affirmed the will and the intention of
        the signatories to defend their security and independence and to keep
        the region free of international conflicts. Four months later, the
        chiefs of staff of the armed forces of the six member states met to
        discuss regional military cooperation. The immediate objective was to
        protect themselves from the dangers posed by the Iran-Iraq War and the
        political violence associated with revolutionary Islamism. In a series
        of meetings over the years, the defense ministers and chiefs of staff
        devoted numerous sessions to the improvement of military cooperation and
        the creation of a joint command and joint air defense mechanisms.
        Managing their common security challenges collectively has made progress
        in some areas, but little in others. Creation of a fully integrated air
        defense system was far from a reality as of early 1993. The GCC states
        have not realized plans to develop an arms production capacity, although
        they have launched a new effort to revive an earlier arrangement with
        Egypt to create a pan-Arab weapons industry.
        <p>Political differences among GCC members have been the main obstacles
        to placing gulf defense on a collective rather than on a bilateral
        basis, even in such matters as achieving interoperability of equipment
        and cooperating in training, logistics, and infrastructure. The GCC
        experienced delays in reaching agreement to cooperate in internal
        security matters because Kuwait, the chief target of terrorism, feared
        that its relatively liberal domestic security regime might be impaired.
        Until Kuwait agreed to a GCC agreement in late 1987, Saudi Arabia and
        several other members of the GCC coordinated their efforts bilaterally,
        including the exchange of equipment, expertise, and training; the
        extradition of criminals; and the interception of border infiltrators.
        GCC members have adopted parallel policies on deportation and travel
        restrictions and share information on suspected terrorists and plots.
        <p>Ground and air units of the six member states have carried out
        small-scale combined training exercises. Military assistance, provided
        mainly by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait under GCC auspices, has enabled
        Bahrain to modernize its stock of combat aircraft and Oman to improve
        its air and sea defenses around the Strait of Hormuz. In 1984 GCC
        defense ministers agreed to create the Peninsula Shield force and base
        it at Hafar al Batin in Saudi Arabia, about sixty kilometers south of
        the Kuwaiti border. Under the command of a Saudi general, the unit
        consists of one Saudi brigade and a composite brigade with token
        personnel from the other states.
        <p>The limited reaction of the GCC to the August 2 Iraqi invasion of
        Kuwait exposed its weakness when faced with direct aggression against a
        member of the alliance by a much stronger power. The GCC immediately
        condemned the Iraqi action, but when GCC defense ministers met three
        weeks later, they could only agree on strengthening the Peninsula Shield
        force. During the Persian Gulf War, national contingents deployed
        separately as units of Arab task forces.
        <p>At the conclusion of the war on March 3, 1991, the six members of the
        GCC, along with Syria and Egypt, met in Damascus to agree on the
        establishment of a permanent security force to protect Kuwait against
        future aggression. Syria and Egypt were to contribute troop contingents
        on a reimbursable basis. The Damascus Agreement soon unraveled when
        differences emerged over the desirability of a long-term Egyptian and
        Syrian presence in the gulf. However, Egypt and Syria remain committed
        under the agreement to send military aid to Kuwait and the other gulf
        states if a threat arises.
        <p>Kuwait subsequently negotiated defense cooperation agreements with
        the United States, Britain, and France as an additional form of security
        if its borders were again threatened. At a GCC meeting in late 1991,
        Oman proposed that the six GCC members develop a 100,000-strong joint
        security force under a unified military command. The Omani plan was set
        aside after other defense ministers questioned whether the manpower
        target was attainable and whether administrative and procedural problems
        could be overcome. The consensus of the ministers was that the Peninsula
        Shield force should be the nucleus of a unified army, the realization of
        which might be many years in the future.</p>
