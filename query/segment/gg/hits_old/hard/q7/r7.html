Watch the Video, <br />
<br />
U.S. military officials have told CBS News that Iran is sending money and weapons onto the Afghan battlefield. But U.S. commanders are not allowed to comment publicly and its unclear to them what the U.S. strategy is for dealing with Irans increasingly deadly involvement. <br />
 The deadliest form of roadside bomb on the Iraqi battlefield - explosively formed penetrators (EFPs) - is now being found in Afghanistan. <br />
 Lethal armor piercing bombs that can slice through U.S. humvees are also an Iranian specialty. <br />
 More worrying still: U.S. intelligence believes Iran is supplying surface to air missiles to the Taliban - the very same weapon the U.S. supplied to the Afghan resistance to bring down the Russians.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just like with Iraq, the left denied Iranian involvement in supplying weapons and training to Shia AND Sunni (weapons) insurgents.<br />

There you go,<br />
<br />
You are coming here and posting not wanting to give merit to the fact taht Iran is a bad actor. So you are predisposed to apologize or deny that they are involved even though now it has been proven that Iran was supplying the deadliest IED/EFPs to Iraqi insurgents. <br />
<br />
Yet in 2006 there were plenty of people like you calling people who pointed out Iran's involvement as right wing nuts, and that the US was wrong on Iraq WMDs.</div></div><hr />

hahahaa, you can't really believe what you are saying? USA fought proxy wars fro the same reason the SU did, to gain influence in the world. Freedom and being the &quot;evil empire&quot; (can't believe you used that term, you child) had nothing to do with it. And definitely not in the case of Afghanistan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No Ronald Reagan was a bad actor. Iran is a country in the middle of two American made wars. They don't love America but there is no evidence they have actually done anything to make life hard for the US so far. If they really wanted the US out they could simply buy 1,000 MANPADs and 1,000 TOW knockoffs direct from China and then deliver them into both Iraq and Afghanistan just like the US did to the Soviets. The ATGMs is less publicised but the Muj had Milans, I have footage on video tape from a CNN report. Of course the CNN reporter describes the muj firing Milan ATGMs at the T-54 tanks as firing artillery and they don't actually manage to get a hit with the weapon. (hahahaha), but they use numbers and terrain and overrun the position eventually.<br />
<br />
Where is this unequivicol evidence that fighters in both regions needed Iranian equipment to learn to kill tanks with shaped charges? I would think US and British special forces must be pretty crap if they hadn't taught them in the 1980s against the Soviets. I would suggest that the initial failures and later successes you are desperate to prove is evidence of Iranian interference is more likely trial and error. The bombs they used to kill the old Soviet tanks the Soviets sent to Afghanistan didn't work on the western tank. Solution make the bombs bigger. All of a sudden they start working... must be Iran...<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet in 2006 there were plenty of people like you calling people who pointed out Iran's involvement as right wing nuts, and that the US was wrong on Iraq WMDs.<br />
<br />
Some Iranians being involved is possible. Official Iranian influence is as yet unproven. And Iraq had no WMDs. They just didn't exist. The only evidence I have read about since the US invasion were rounds left over from WWI that were buried and mobile chem systems that had never been used.<br />
<br />
<br />
And quite a few other countries, intel agencies as well................<br />
<br />
Whats your point?<br />
<br />
The fact that they were sure that Iraq had lots of WMDs weaponised and within 45 minutes of actually being used, that were a threat to the entire world.<br />
The fact that they were wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our best bet is to help destabilize Iran.<br />
<br />
Yeah, imposing a dictator on them made the US really popular last time, I am sure putting them through that again will make them think they should do exactly as they are told when they are told. Or it might make them think America is never going to leave them alone so they might have to actually do something about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
and yes I am aware that the USA played this game when the Soviets were in Afghanistan, but lets face it, when faced off against the Soviets the west really did face up to the 'evil empire' that fought proxy wars against freedom and the west for many decades till it quite frankly - lost.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but you have a bit of a cheek suggesting it was done for freedom and democracy. Look at what the US did. If it really was interested in freedom and democracy then the goal should have been democracy for the 1.5 billion Chinese, not the 400 odd million Soviets. It is amusing you think the US won when Communist China is still in operation. If the cold war was about democracy then the CIA never would have put the Shah of Iran in power and the people of Iran wouldn't have so many bad feelings about the west in general and the US in particular.</div></div><hr />

 I am still not convinced that Iranian government supported directly or indirectly Shias in Iraq. Few Iranian Rpg launchers and rockets does not prove anything. AKs and RPGs are available in all black markets in the region.  If they wanted to cause havoc in Iraq they could have done it.<br />
In an interview that was posted in this forum the Taliban also  showed some Iranian made weapons among other. The only group that receives Iranian government support is Hezbollah. They have the latest high-tech Iranian weapons. Until the Taliban start showing the same high tech weapons I don't see a reason to accuse them.<br />

But F@CK YOU you cockroach for suggesting America started the war in Afghanistan.So you are saying the Taleban started the war by what? Refusing to hand over a person on their territory despite noextradition rights negotiated between the two countries.<br />
I would suggest a cockroach has a better understanding of international law.<br />
The US gave an ultimation to the Taleban government of Afghanistan and when that ultimatim was ignored the US invaded. The US clearly started it.<br />
<br />
<br />
These accusations about Iran and Taliban is connected with the ongoing Iranian nuclear program that some want to see it terminated (included me).Sounds to me like the claims that the Iranians support the taleban and insurgents in Iraq are a bit like US government claims that Saddam was supporting Al Quada before the invasion. Of course rabid supporters of the US government on another forum I used to visit posted documents they claimed showed clear evidence of a link between Saddam and Al Quada.<br />
Of course after reading the documents in question it was clear that as per usual Al Quada was an enemy of Saddam and that Al Quada bases in Northern Iraq were only present because of the northern no fly zone prevented Saddam from dealing with them in his usual way.<br />
<br />
BTW Saddams gassing of the Kurds was portrayed in the west after Saddam had invaded Kuwaite as if he was gassing his own people. At the time it was clear to everyone of course that he was in fact doing what Turkey does to this day with the Kurd seperatists when ever they can... ie kills them. The Kurds want to recreate Kurdistan, but the problem is that Kurdistan if drawn on a map occupies land currently inside the borders of Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. Hense the Kurds in Turkey and Syria and Iran and Iraq are not really Turkish, Syrian, Iranian, or Iraqi, they are seperatists who want their own country.<br />
<br />
Claiming Iran is supporting those fighting the US in Iraq and Afghanistan is a great way to bring into focus Iran as the bad guy, and take focus away from the problems in Iraq and Afghanistan created by the US invasions.<br />
<br />
Even if Iran was supporting the rebels as much as they could so what. They are not obliged to support the US in anything. It is not like the US doesn't dabble in the affairs of others. The US has interests... well everyone else does too.  Even cockroaches. :roll:<br />
<br />
BTW interesting post Al Bundy. Nice to see people actually think about things rather than take the press released from the US state department as gospel.<br />
<br />
Would also like to say best of luck to those in Afghanistan and Iraq trying to rebuild and repair two countries with very long histories.</div></div><hr />

I would suggest a cockroach has a better understanding of international law.<br />
The US gave an ultimation to the Taleban government of Afghanistan and when that ultimatim was ignored the US invaded. The US clearly started it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Which shows how little understanding about Taliban the US had at that time. Looking now at the Afghan situation, it appears clear to me that the Taliban had no power whatsoever to comply with the US demands. It is true, they had some sort of government, but probably didn't control in the country coherent way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pashtun tribal code made it impossible to comply with US demands, not much else.</div></div><hr />

I've said it once, but i'll say it again. <br />
<br />
There's no point in Iran supplying the Taliban when there are plenty of other groups in Afghanistan who attack the US just at much and on top of that, aren't at war with Iran. <br />
<br />
It's like the US choosing to support Hezbollah in their fight against Al Qaeda elements in Lebabon, sure they've got a common enemy, but it would be better for the US to support the Lebanese Army.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but they can 'add to the fire&quot; by supplying their allies, not someone they've been fighting for the past 20 years. In all honesty, the Taliban have caused more direct damage to their country then the US.<br />
<br />
Also, while the average Iranian doesn't hate Americans (just their foreign policy), there is a deep seeted hatred of the Taliban because they are genuinely bad people that are screwing up their neighborhood.</div></div><hr />

Taliban did not seize power way after the Soviets left Afghanistan.</div></div><hr />

The Shah fell before the USSR moved into Afghanistan, let alone the Taliban which arose in the early nineties, that being said you could be right about the Pashtun tribes that would become the Taliban. Alsono matter what Hollis says, the US did support the tribes that would become the Taliban, but the actual Taliban themselves, no the US never actively funded and supported them. <br />
There were some pictures floating around here a while back of mortars with Iranian mortars, and everyone was crying out how this was uncontrovertable proof, until then someone read the date and it was from the 1980's/1990's when Iran was backing the Northern Alliance.</div></div><hr />

The US supported the Iraqi's. They also gave the Iranians TOW&quot;s, HAWK's and some other small missiles like that, but it was all clandestine, under the table stuff in order to get back US hostages from Lebanon.</div></div><hr />

Iran may be giving support to the Taliban under the leadership of Mullah Omar who in Kandahar put on the cloak of the prophet and claimed the title of &quot;The Commander of  the Faithful&quot; and leads a following who considers many Sunnis to be worst than idol worshipers -- ie much less Shias who are considered heretics and dead meat -- but it would be like Jews supporting Hitler.  So maybe.<br />
<br />
Also, read what happened to the Iranian &quot;diplomats&quot; in the last northern Afghan city taken by the Taliban forces before 9/11.<br />
<br />
Again, it may be true.  But highly unlikely.<br />

AQ attacks the US, murdering over 3,000 innocent people + damages<br />
<br />
US demands Taliban hands over AQ, operating out of A-Stan<br />
<br />
Taliban gives shelter to AQ, pretty much tells the US to FO. <br />
<br />
So, if I understand this correctly, the United States did not initiate a conflict in Afghanistan because a transnational (and thereby not dependent on any single base of operations) terrorist organization that could not possibly be 'handed over' (HOLLIS, please, a little common sense is not much to ask for) by any state actor attacked it? At best, the occupation of Afghanistan was justified by the salient features of the case. But the Taliban state organism that has been combating NATO forces there over the last eight years certainly did not start the conflict...<br />
<br />
Allow an analogy:<br />
<br />
1) The Black Hand assassinates Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo.<br />
2) The Austro-Hungarian government believes the BH to be located in and supported by Serbia.<br />
3) The AH government issues a series of demands to the Serbian government regarding the BH.<br />
4) The Serbian government cannot agree to one of the demands made.<br />
5) Therefore, Serbia started WWI?<br />
<br />
I am by no means against NATO operations in Afghanistan, but this sort of self-serving reasoning is disingenuous. <br />
<br />

I'm sorry, is this referring to me?<br />
<br />
If it is, keep your snide remarks to yourself, if you cannot be bothered to put an ounce of substance into them... Instead of asking me to elucidate my point, you jumped to the nearest, dogmatically safest and most comfortable conclusion. That's a reflection of your reasoning skills and intellectual laziness, and not of the valid argument (debatable as it may be) that received your tender attention. <br />

Bytheway: Wasn´t Iran one of the biggest supporters of Northen Coalition before 2001? And ain´t here a small, insignificant ideologistic differences between Iran (Shias) and Taliban (Sunnis) because last time I checked Taliban did not even consider Shia beeing muslims and was kind of slaughtering them.</div></div><hr />

Interesting in that you feel &quot;common sense&quot; over rides the events at the time.  There are other events leading up the the attacks on the US in 2001.  Even Clinton launched a attack on A-stan soil.   <br />
<br />
http://www.cnn.com/US/9808/20/us.strikes.01/<br />
<br />
Maybe you missed that period of time.  Somehow commonsense and global politics does not seem to mix.  <br />
<br />
Also, you might want to review the Taliban's responses to the US to hand over AQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as today's Taliban VS the Ruling Taliban of Afghanistan in 2001.......  just review the last 8 years of history.<br />
<br />
<br />
On your response to &quot;could not be possibly handed over&quot;...............  As if there was just a simple one step approach.   Again,  review the Taliban's responses to the US demands on &quot;handing over&quot; AQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
Among the many articles:<br />
<br />
http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0916-01.htm<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - Under             threat of U.S. military strikes, Afghanistan's             Taliban rulers said explicitly for the first time             Sunday that Osama bin Laden is still in the country             and is being kept in a location secret from the             outside world.........Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez             Musharraf, told CNN that hopes that the Taliban will             hand over bin Laden and accede to other U.S. demands             are ``very dim.'' Pakistani contacts have not             succeeded ``in moderating their views on the             surrender of Osama bin Laden,'' he told CNN. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
CNN Article in 1998;<br />
<br />
&quot;In Afghanistan, a spokesman for the ruling Taliban, Mullah Abdullah, said that &quot;bin Laden is safe and no damage has been done to any of his companions.&quot; Bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan with the permission of the Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic group that controls most of the country.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lokos</div><div class="date">10-17-2009, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You said 'hand over Al-Qaeda' (several times), not 'hand over Osama bin Laden'. Since those terms are not synonyms, why bring OBL up in refuting my rebuttal?<br />
<br />
If you'll please, don't argue the straw man. My position is simple: you cannot 'hand over' an organization that doesn't depend on any one man, geographical base of operations or other singular facet of its structure. I did not mention any individual. And that stands even if we're still assuming that the presentations of the Taliban during the aforementioned period should be taken at face value... I don't know why you would, without a deeper look at the contextual issues. Could they have apprehended him, or a significant portion of AQ's senior cadre? Though the Taliban was an administration of sorts, who is to say they had any more control over Afghanistan's hinterlands than the NATO forces operating there with the new Afghan authority now? <br />
<br />
Secondly, AQ attacking the United States still =/= the Taliban starting a conflict with the US. You can say that the United States had a pretext for initiating the conflict, but in doing so keep the language unambiguous. An existing pretext or causus belli isn't the same thing as the other party having 'started the conflict'. If we're talking about the physical conflict (and I believe we are) in Afghanistan now, it began when US forces initiated an offensive effort against the Taliban regime in 2001. I don't see how that's disputable, unless we conflate AQ and the Taliban. Which, to me, seems fairly disingenuous. <br />
<br />
Like I said: I don't disagree with the NATO effort in Afghanistan. I just disagree with a fantasy approach to its context.<br />
