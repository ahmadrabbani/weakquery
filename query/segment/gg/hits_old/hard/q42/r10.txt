 UNIVERSITY PRESS                          America Betrayed    Bush, bin Laden, 9-11 by R. Joseph, Ph.D.  University Press ISBN: 0971644578    Prescot Bush and Rockefeller's Standard Oil had been in business with the Hitler regime and the Nazis since 1933, and in 1942, three Bush businesses were seized by the U.S. government, for violation of the Trading With the Enemies Act.  Three generations of the Bush clan became members of a German secret society: the Yale chapter of the "Order of Skull and Bones." In Germany, the Order of Skull of Bones --also known as "The Brotherhood of Death"-- gave rise to Hitler and the dreaded SS. Prescot Bush, through his shipping company, became a special "Friend" of Himmler's SS--the same SS which, in conjunction with IG Farbin, ran the concentration and slave labor camps.  The Bush clan and Rockefeller's standard Oil, were in business with IG Farben, as well as with the Saudis who had also partnered with Hitler.  At the conclusion of WWII, and Germany's defeat, thousands of high ranking Nazis and SS agents were recruited, by Bush-Rockefeller lawyer, Allen Dulles, into what would later become the CIA. Allen Dulles, and later, George Bush, would become directors of the CIA...  ...IG Farbin, a consortium of companies that included Bayer, conducted horible experiements on concentration camp inmates to discover an "ethnic biological weapon" --a deadly disease that would target specific ethnic groups... Drs. funded by the Rockefeller foundation directed this research.  In 1957, a scientist who completed his medical training in Nazi-occupied Poland, and who was funded by the Rockefeller foundation, injected 300,000 Central African men, women, and children, with an experimental polio vacine--a vacine that contained a deadly AIDS-like viruse, monkey HSIV. Years later, Central Africa would become "Ground Zero" for the AIDS/HIV epidemic...  On August 6, 2001, Bush received a memorandum titled "Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.," but then did nothing. Two weeks later, CIA Chief Tenet and his top deputies received a briefing paper labeled "Islamic Extremist Learns to Fly." Bush and Cheney were notified and did nothing...War would be good politics and good for the business of war.  ...Three generations of the Bush clan have been in business with governments and people who kill Americans, and on the morning of 9-11-2001, Bush sr. was in business with the bin Ladens and other Saudis who had helped fund Osama bin Laden and the attack of 9-11-2001... 15 of the hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and Bush did nothing to stop the attack.  The attack of 9-11, would transform an inept, incompetent president into a war time leader who would attack not Saudi Arabia but Iraq and then steal its oil and assets...as well as attack American Civil Liberties and the U.S. constitution...  Bush knew in advance, but welcomed the attack of 9-11-2001, as its aftermath would not only earn his family and associates billions of dollars, but would provide an excuse for attacking Iraq and toppling its leader, Saddam Hussein--the sworn enemy of Osama Bin Laden.

"Terrorists... plan.... to take control of a plane and fly it into the World Trade Center" --Minnesota FBI Supervisor, August, 2001.  Despite their denials, high ranking officials in the FBI and CIA have known for years that men directly linked to al-Qaeda were receiving pilot training at U.S. schools in the United States. And, they have known since 1993, that the World Trade Center was a primary target. The FBI knew, because they, and the Bush administration, played a direct role in making the 1993 bombing and the attacks of 9/11/2001, possible.  As detailed in Part I of this text, the Bush clan and associates have been partnering with terrorists for decades, using murderers, rapists, gangsters, and the like, in innumerable operations which were designed to increase the power and wealth of the Bush et al. (chapters 2-6). It was only a matter of time before America and American citizens would also be targeted.  As detailed in Part I, the Bush family even partnered with the Nazis, and maintained that partnership after Hitler declared war on the United States (chapter 2). For the Bush clan, it was business as usual. War is good for business, and if Americans are killed, then what of it, so long as in the end the Bush family and their associates make money and increase their power.  In 1990, George H.W. Bush and his administration--which included Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and 300 other individuals who would 10 years later become part of the administration of his son--began laying the ground work for what would become the first major terrorist attack ever, on U.S. soil. That attack took place in 1993, when the World Trade Center was first bombed. The Bush team intended to blame the 1993 attack on Saddam Hussein (chapter 9)--when in fact the true behind the scenes culprits, were the CIA, FBI, and the good friends and business partners of Bush and gang: the Saudis and the Pakistanis.  Indeed, just as the Bush family and their associates have partnered with the bin Laden family and a number of Saudis and Pakistanis who helped finance the 9/11 attack, George H.W. Bush, his CIA and FBI, the Saudis and Pakistanis were also linked to the 1993 World Trade Center bombers.  *****  As detailed in court records, books, newspaper and magazine articles (1,2,3), Mahmud Abouhalima, Mohammad Salameh, and Ramzi Yousef, spent several months planning the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. They fashioned their bomb using $3,000 worth of common ingredients.  The bomb was loaded into a rented Ryder van and then transported from Jersey City, through the Holland Tunnel, into Manhattan. The van with its massive bomb ready to go off, was left in an underground parking garage beneath the World Trade Center.  The terrorists were convinced they were about to murder 50,000 Americans.  Then they ran.  Yousef didn't remain in New York to savor the "triumph." He immediately grabbed a flight at John F. Kennedy Airport, flew to Frankfurt Germany and then made his way to Afghanistan--what would eventually become the home base of al-Qaeda and bin Laden.  Abouhalima was too excited to flee. Instead he went to Tower Records in downtown Manhattan and waited patiently in the classical music section for the apocalypse.  Mohammad Salameh also waited and watched. And then, the bomb exploded.  Although the World Trade Center shook and trembled, it did not collapse.  Although thousands were injured, only six people were killed. The terrorists were angered and embittered. They had failed.  Mohammad Salameh was so disgusted by the results, he felt so cheated, that he disobeyed orders and returned to the Ryder truck rental office in Jersey City. He wanted his money back. He demanded that his deposit on the van be returned.  He was immediately arrested.  Four suspects went on trial on September 13, 1993, and it lasted 6 months. Over 204 witnesses came forward and the prosecution presented more than 1,000 pieces of evidence. The defendants were convicted on March 4, 1994, in federal court on all 38 counts against them and all four were sentenced to 240 years in prison.  Two years later, master terrorist Ramzi Yousef who had helped to plan the bombing, was apprehended in Pakistan (2). Following his capture, when FBI agents flew fugitive Ramzi Yousef back to New York to face justice, he glanced down at the World Trade Center and frowned. "See," an FBI agent said as he pointed out the twin skyscrapers from the helicopter. "The Twin Towers are still standing." Yousef replied, "They wouldn't be if I had enough money and explosives." ******  "Yes, I am a terrorist, and I'm proud of it." --Ramzi Yousef.  Ramzi Yousef has an interesting history. After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, he continued his campaign of terror. He bombed an Iranian Shiit shrine--the Shiit religion and Islamic shrines being an anathema to the Sunni-Wahhabi sect and the Saudi royal family, which help fund his terror spree (2). He also tried to kill Benazir Bhutto--the enemy of the Pakistani Intelligence Service. Benazir Bhutto, being a women, was also unacceptable to many of the ruling Islamic elite, in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and other Muslim countries. Thus she had to go.  It is also alleged that he planned to assassinate the Pope and President Clinton, as well as bomb and destroy 11 airliners over the Pacific Ocean (2). FBI agents dubbed Yousef "an evil genius."  According to Neil Herman, the FBI Supervisory Special Agent who led the New York Joint Terrorist Task Force (2): "Yousef was a pretty unique person. He liked the bar scene, he liked women, he liked moving around. Yousef was very good. He was well trained, very clever. He'll certainly be ranked right up there with the all-timers. Even to this day, he is a very shadowy figure that we really don't know that much about, even after all that's been done and all that's been investigated on him."  Yes, but who trained him? Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto blamed the United States and the CIA, which she accused of financing Pakistan's radical Muslim clerics and terrorist groups. That the CIA was training and funding terrorists, in Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere, including Osama bin Laden, is a well established fact (4). Indeed, according to Osama bin Laden (5): "I created my first [military] camps, where these volunteers underwent training led by Pakistani and American officers. The arms were supplied by the Americans and the money by the Saudis." That the CIA was also training terrorists to conduct terrorist operations against the United States, is yet another unpleasant fact--as detailed in this book. Thus we should not be surprised to discover that the plan to bomb the World Trade Center, in 1993, has the FBI's and the CIA's fingers prints all over it. "The Arab bombers in the [1993 World Trade Center bombing] case, who were tied to Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, received their training during the Afghan War from mujahideen groups trained and supplied by the CIA. The Sheik had been closely allied with Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of one of the most radical anti-American elements of the Afghan mujahideen, and the one most favored by U.S. intelligence" (6).  Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, a man described as a "valuable" CIA "asset" (7), was summed to the United States in July of 1990, during the Presidency of George H. W. Bush. He arrived in New York, via Saudi Arabia on "a tourist visa issued by an undercover agent of the CIA" (7).  Sheik Omar had been associated with the CIA for at least two decades, and possibly since the early 1960s. In 1979, his relationship with U.S. intelligence agencies and Pakistani intelligence officials, became formalized. He had been chosen to help coordinate and unify the various mujahideen groups who were fighting against the Soviet backed regime in Afghanistan, and who had also been fighting among themselves. The blind Sheik, was a Muslim cleric. Like Osama bin Laden who had also began working with the CIA during the same period, he was an expert at propaganda and in providing direction to others by preaching holy war. CIA and Special Forces officers based in Pakistan, considered him a "valuable asset" (7,8).  While in Afghanistan during the "jihad," he once said: "I have never asked Allah for anything. But I am under a great disadvantage now. If only Allah could give me eyes for a couple of years, or for a couple of hours, so I could fight in the jihad!" The administration of George H.W. Bush offered the Sheik the opportunity to conduct his "jihad" in the United States. Initially, "his primary purpose was to set up a U.S. infrastructure, a funding mechanism, and an organizational base for militant Islamic groups" (7,8). However, unbeknownst to the Sheik, once he arrived in the U.S., the CIA/FBI made arrangements for his entourage to be penetrated by informers--men who would urge the Sheik and his followers, or Islamic groups he was associated with, to bomb New York landmarks (9).  One of those Islamic groups had been led by El Sayyid Nosair.  In November of 1990, El Sayyid Nosair, or members of his circle, shot and killed Rabbi Meir Kahane, a right-wing Jewish-hate monger and leader of the Jewish Defense League. Nosair was convicted and jailed in 1991. In 1992, as the presidential election year kicked into high gear, and as Clinton began to overtake president George Bush in the polls, the FBI, via an undercover, FBI-informant, Emad Salem, began urging Sheik Omar and El Sayyid Nosair's group, to bomb New York landmarks. El Sayyid Nosair was, however, a small time thinker. El Sayyid Nosair suggested to Emad Salem, that they should use "pipe bombs" to extract revenge.  Salem, who was working for the FBI, offered to make the bombs (2). He also, apparently, at the urgings of the FBI, suggested that El Sayyid Nosair should think big, and that various New York landmarks, such as the World Trade Center would be a tempting target. Of course, to really make an impact, that would require more than a pipebomb.  The plot, however, fell apart, when the FBI asked Salem to play an even more active role, and to wear a body wire and to testify in a trial, following the bombing. He refused.  Enter Ramzi Yousef. In Gov. Exhibit 55119-E , in the trial of Shaykh Omar et. al. (8) an FBI-informant, identified as "NY 28214-CW-C." detailed a conversation he had with Mahmoud Abu Halima--one of the men convicted of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. "Mahmoud advised NY 28214-CW-C in connection with the World Trade Center that the planned act was not as big as what subsequently occurred. Mahmoud informed that Ramzi Yousef showed up on the scene and brought a number of individuals together and escalated the initial plot. Mahmoud stated that Ramzi Yousef used himself and others involved with the Trade Center blast as pawns and then immediately after the blast left the country."  Hence, when the plot fell apart, because an FBI-agent/informant refused to participate further, Ramzi Yousef arrived on the scene and took his place.  Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the alleged mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing, appears to have been funded by Pakistan's Intelligence Service (ISI), and the Saudis via Muhammad Jamal Khalifa, bin Laden's brother-in-law (2).  THE ISI  The ISI has had a long-standing relationship with al-Qaeda, and used al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan to train covert terrorist operations against other countries (10). As noted, after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, Ramzi Yousef, returned to Afghanistan. He would also frequently travel to Pakistan.  During the Reagan-Bush administrations, "while the C.I.A. supplied money and weapons, it was the ISI that moved them into Afghanistan. The Americans relied almost entirely on the Pakistani service to allocate the weapons to the rebel leaders, and the senior C.I.A. officials involved developed close relations with their counterparts" (10). It was more than a close relationship. The CIA sought to control the ISI.  In the early 1990s, ISI director, Hameed Gul, complained that he was removed as director, because the "Bush administration was demanding that the agency be placed at the disposal of the Americans, as if it were a mercenary force" (10). The campaign to remove Gul began in 1992. He was eventually removed and replaced by someone that the Bush administration felt they could work with, Lt. General Asad Durrani who is now Ambassador to Saudi Arabia.  The ISI, although having maintained a long relationship with the Reagan-Bush administrations, was, in 1993, hostile to the Clinton administration--as was the Pentagon and American military establishment as they viewed Clinton as a draft dodger. As noted, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef sought to assassinate Clinton. Likewise, because the ISI was also believed to be hostile to Clinton, the "Secret Service adamantly opposed a planned trip by President Clinton to Pakistan out of concern for his safety" (10). In 1993, Pakistan's ISI, was funding terrorist operations not only in Afghanistan, but in India and America (11). Indeed, in 1994, "former Pakistan Prime Minister Narwaz Sharif alleged that his Army Chief of Staff, General Aslam Beg, and General Asad Durrani, head of the Inter Service Intelligence agency, had informed him, while he was in office, that the Pakistani Army and ISI planned to conduct covert acts of terrorism in other countries" (12).  The World Trade Center was bombed on February 26, 1993. Two weeks later, there was a series of world trade center bombings, this time, in India. And just as the ISI was implicated in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the ISI was directly implicated "in the bombings that devastated central Bombay on March 12, 1993, killing over 300 people" (12). Lt. General Asad Durrani was in charge of the ISI when these bombings occurred.  Again, let us recall that Lt. General Asad Durrani had been placed at the head of the ISI at the urgings of the Bush administration and CIA, in the early 1990s, and was thus head of the ISI in 1993 (13).  Coincidentally, yet another ISI General is linked to the second attack on the World Trade Center. Lt. General Mahmoud Ahmad became a "US approved appointee" of the ISI, in 1999 (14) and was still head of the ISI on the morning of 9/11/2001.  ISI director, General Mahmoud Ahmad also just happened to be in the US when the 9/11 attacks occurred (15,16,17). He arrived in the US on September 4, 2001, and had a series of meetings with his counterparts at the CIA and the Pentagon and at the State Department both before and after the attacks on the WTC (15,16). According to the New York Times (16), "he happened to be here on a regular visit of consultations." Just an innocent little visit, we are told.  In fact, ISI director, General Mahmoud Ahmad was having breakfast with Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) and Rep. Porter Goss (R-Fla.) when the 9/11 attacks occurred (17). Graham and Goss (a veteran of the CIA) were later appointed co-chairmen in charge of the commission to investigate the events and intelligence failures behind September 11 2001 attack on the Pentagon and World Trade Center (WTC).  Yet another coincidence, it was subsequently revealed by India's intelligence agencies, that ISI director General Mahmoud Ahmad had ordered his aide, Ahmad Umar Sheik, to wire $100,000. to Mohammed Atta, the leader of the 9/11 hijackings (18). Although the corporate controlled US media have tried to obfuscate the revelation, by trying to imply that the ISI was not directly involved, General Ahmad was forced to step down from the ISI soon after this charge was made.  Naturally, the Bush administration and the FBI and CIA have shown no interest in questioning him much less arresting him. Even if we accept the clumsy attempts of the corporate controlled American media to dissociate General Ahmad from the 9/11 attacks, the fact nevertheless remains that the ISI has been funding terrorists and al-Qaeda for years--as even the New York Times admits (10).  Thus, the ISI's General Ahmad, whose ISI, is linked to al-Qaeda and bin Laden, was meeting with his CIA and Pentagon counterparts, as well as the chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees on the day of and in the days just before and after al-Qaeda terrorists attacked the WTC and Pentagon, on September 11, 2001.  And, of course, that's just a coincidence. Nothing suspicious about that. No siree.  ******  Immediately following the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, the Justice Department issued a "gag order" ordering all agencies to remain silent and not speak to reporters. Nevertheless, one reporter got a question in. The reporter wanted to know if it was true the FBI had advance notice of the bombing, but let the bombing go forth, for as yet unspecified reasons.  The same questions would arisen following the 9/11 attack. Of course there was advanced knowledge of the 1993 bombing, as was revealed in court documents (8) and as was also alleged by the New York Times (3). The FBI had several informants, working on the inside, one of whom, at the request of the FBI, offered to make the bomb, and who suggested possible targets. Indeed, there are allegations that the FBI was providing funds, equipment, supplies, support and training to the actual perpetrators. According to tapes of conversations made by the informant, the contents of some of which were revealed in court and also reported by the New York Times, the FBI had planned on "building the bomb with a phony powder and grabbing the people who were involved in it." After the 1993 bombing, the informant also went on to say: "Guys, now you saw this bomb went off and you both know that we could avoid that." Several months later, Sheik Omar, a Saudi- ISI- and CIA-financed cleric was arrested in connection with the February, 1993, World Trade Center bombing, and for conspiring to attack several New York landmarks. Rahman and nine others were convicted on October 1, 1995.  ******  The 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, was eventually blamed on al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden--and as detailed in pervious chapter, Osama bin Laden had been working with the CIA since 1978.  It is bin Laden's association with the CIA, which might explain why "the Pentagon gave permission" for the sale of a commercial jet to a bin Laden representative, in 1993. "The plane had a range of around 1500 miles -- close to the distance between Boston and Los Angeles -- and it was purchased in Arizona. One of bin Laden's main men in America was Essan Al-Ridi, who worked as a flight instructor in Texas. He was contacted that year by Wadih El-Hage -- who was later jailed for his part in the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Africa which killed 244 people -- and asked to help buy jets" (19).  "The deal went through for about $250,000, and bin Laden offered Al-Ridi a job as a pilot. The plane was bought at the 'bone yard' in Tucson, Arizona -- the local name for the storage unit at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Centre at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base where retired aircraft are kept. The US military, therefore, sold the plane to bin Laden -- and it was the Pentagon which gave permission for the aircraft to leave the base" (19).  "The plane was flown out of the US to bin Laden's base, at that time, in Khartoum in Sudan. America aided bin Laden... This aircraft was used to transport the missiles from Pakistan which killed American special forces in Somalia" (19). Presumably the CIA and the Pentagon did not know the bin Laden and al-Qaeda were planning to target special forces in Somalia--that is, unless they were trying to embarrass Clinton. However, in 1993, they did know that the World Trade Center was the number one target of terrorists, including al-Qaeda.  ********  U.S. officials have known since 1993 that the World Trade Center was at the top of al-Qaeda's list of potential targets of terrorism. Indeed, New York City and the Trade Center were attacked in 1993 and 2001 for some of the same reasons.  For one, New York is believed to be a "Jewish city."  Two, New York city and the World Trade Center were heavily populated. The World Trade Center was a city in-itself, with offices that could house over 50,000 people. Terrorists knew that if the World Trade Center could be destroyed, there would be an enormous and devastating loss of life. Three, New York is one of the most recognizable cities in the world. It is thus one of the most recognizable and memorable targets. It would make for a prestigious trophy.  Four, the World Trade Center, the heartbeat of lower Manhattan, was viewed as a symbol of America's wealth. To strike at the World Trade Center, would be a slap across the face of America's powerful financial elite.  Years later, despite their denials, the FBI, the CIA and Bush administration officials knew that a major target for a second terrorist attack was still the World Trade Center.  The World Trade Center was an obvious target whose destruction would strike terror into the hearts of America, generate incredible publicity, and draw hundreds of new recruits eager to join a successful cause. The attack could also be used as a campaign gimmick by the Republicans to increase their power, as a lever to increase defense spending, thus benefiting the Bush-connected Carlyle group, and as an excuse to go to war, first in Afghanistan, and then in Iraq where the world's second largest oil reserves can be found.  As is the case in the 1993 attack, the evidence indicates that top officials in the FBI and CIA, also had foreknowledge of the 9/11/2001 attack. Indeed, they and the Bush administration not only welcomed the attack, but in addition to bin Laden, they helped recruit and train at least five of those who were involved. AN AVALANCE OF WARNINGS "Terrorists... plan.... to take control of a plane and fly it into the World Trade Center" --Minnesota FBI Supervisor, August, 2001.  "I don't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center." --Condaleezza Rice, National Security Advisor, September, 2001.  Not only had it been predicted, not only had the Bush administration been warned, but many years ago the CIA and the U.S. military developed detailed plans that would involve a fake terrorist attack using hijacked planes and the mass murder of Americans, in order to justify going to war against other nations.  As detailed in a book by James Bamford "Body of Secrets," and as reported by David Ruppe, ABC News.com (5/1/2001), the "U.S. Military drafted plans to terrorize U.S. cities to provoke war. The plans included the killing of innocent people and acts of terrorism in U.S. cities [in order] to create public support for a war. Code named Operation Northwoods, the plans reportedly included hijacking planes, blowing up a U.S. ship, and even orchestrating violent terrorism in U.S. cities." Top Generals are quoted as saying "casualty lists in U.S. newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation." According to ABC news, "The plans had the written approval of all of the Joint Chiefs of Staff."  *****  Despite their denials, the FBI and CIA had known knew for years that men with links to bin Laden and his organization were attending U.S. flight schools. And, they had known since 1995 that Islamic terrorists were planning on hijacking U.S. commercial airlines and crash them into U.S. cities. For example, in 1995 and 1996, the FBI learned that al-Qaeda associate, Abdul Hakim Murad and two other men, had received flight training at four different flight schools in the U.S. during the early 1990s: Coastal Aviation, Richmor Aviation, Schenectady flight school and Alpha Tango Flying Services in San Antonio. Murad was in fact recruited by Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the al-Qaeda operative who had plotted and carried out the 1993 World Trade Center bombing (20). Murad was subsequently convicted of plotting to crash a suicide plane into CIA headquarters and blow up a dozen U.S. commercial jetliners over the Pacific. Specifically, it was determined in 1996, that Yousef and Murad had been plotting to train and deploy five-man terrorist teams who were to hijack and bomb 12 different commercial jetliners, including Northwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines. Some of the hijacked jets were to be crashed into U.S. cities, including New York and Washington (2,20).  As detailed in a Jan. 20, 1995, report issued by the Manila police, Murad had attended flight schools in New York, Texas, California and North Carolina. He earned a commercial pilot's license. As he explained to authorities, it was his intention to "board any American commercial aircraft pretending to be an ordinary passenger. Then he will hijack said aircraft, control its cockpit and dive it at the C.I.A. headquarters. There will be no bomb or any explosive that he will use in its execution. It is simply a suicidal mission that he is very much willing to execute." U.S. government prosecutors described the plot as "one of the most hideous crimes anyone ever conceived." According to the Washington Post, 3Since 1996, the FBI had been developing evidence that international terrorists were using US flight schools to learn to fly jumbo jets" (21).  In 1996, the FBI again received information that Arab pilots were plotting with Pakistani terrorists to plant bombs on a number of U.S. airliners, and that terrorists were planning on using crop-dusters and other planes for a suicide attack from the air during the Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta. US Customs Service jets and Black Hawk helicopters were deployed, during the games, to intercept any suspicious aircraft (22).  In October of 1996, FBI agents in Phoenix were informed by an undercover agent, Harry Ellen, that a number of Arab extremists at a local mosque were receiving aviation training. Ellen was alarmed and informed the Phoenix office "that it would be terrible if the bad guys were able to gain this kind of access to airplanes, flight training and crop dusters. You really ought to look at this, it's an interesting mix of people."  Indeed, one of the bad guys may have been Hanji Hanjour, one of the September 11 hijackers. Hanjour was living in Phoenix in 1996, and taking flight lessons at two different local schools: Professional Pilot Training and Cockpit Resource Management. Yet another suspected terrorist, Lotfi Raissi, was also in Phoenix, and later was briefly jailed in Britain on suspicion of training some of the 9/11 terrorists (23). In 1998, there was additional evidence that terrorists trained as pilots were planning an attack on the U.S. Numerous references to pilot training and flight schools were discovered in documents uncovered during the investigation of the terrorists who had committed the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania (24).  Two participants in the 1998 bombings, who subsequently turned government informant, also informed the FBI that they and other men directly linked with bin Laden had received pilot training.  For example, Essam al-Ridi, had taken classes at the Ed Boardman Aviation School in Fort Worth. L'Houssaine Kerchtou, admitted that bin Laden had sent him to a flight school in Nairobi (24,25,26).  In addition, the FBI learned that one of bin Laden's associates, Ihab Ali Nawawi, received flight training at Airman Flight School in Norman, Oklahoma. This same Ihab Ali Nawawi was linked to the 1998 embassy bombings.  According to Ms. Hill, in reviewing evidence before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, investigating 9/11 intelligence lapses, the FBI received yet another report in late 1988, that al-Qaeda are a related terrorist organization was planning to bring students to the United States to train at flight schools. Their purpose was to obtain skills that would enable them to use the planes as weapons. In 1999 an analysis prepared for U.S. intelligence explicitly warned that Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda organization might hijack a commercial jet and then crash it into public and government buildings: "Suicide bomber(s) belonging to al-Qaeda's Martyrdom Battalion could crash-land an aircraft packed with high explosives (C-4 and semtex) into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), or the White House."  In 1999, and as detailed in court records (27), the FBI learned that Ihab Mohammed Ali, a suspected coconspirator in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa, had received pilot training in Norman, Oklahoma. Ali, the FBI learned, had received detailed briefings from an al-Qaeda operative, on the lingo of American air traffic control procedures, i.e. what to say and how to say it, so that he could pretend to be the designated pilot following a hijacking.  In November of 1999, U.S. Intelligence began tracking and then later followed Mohammed Atta, Ziad al-Jarrah, and Marwan Al-Shehhi as they traveled from Germany to bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan (28).  In December of 1999, an Algerian terrorist, Ahmed Ressam, was apprehended at the U.S.-Canadian border (29).  Ressam had orders to assist in the bombing of Los Angeles International Airport during the millennium celebrations.  The plot was defeated when authorities were tipped that Ressam was going to enter Washington state from Canada in a car loaded with explosives. Ressam was linked to bin laden. Ressam took his orders from Haydar Abu Doha, who had close ties to bin Laden (29). Haydar Abu Doha, who was arrested after the 9/11 attack on terrorism conspiracy charges, is a key figure in bin Laden's network.  According to Federal prosecutors, in 1998, Haydar Abu Doha met with bin Laden in Afghanistan. The purpose of these meetings was "to discuss cooperation and coordination between al-Qaeda and a group of Algerian terrorists whose activities Abu Doha coordinated and oversaw." Ressam was later provided a skeletal briefing of what was discussed in Afghanistan. al-Qaeda was planning to carry out coordinated terrorist assaults on high profile American targets (29). Ressam was to take an active part in these attacks. He had also journeyed to Afghanistan to receive special training.  As part of a plea bargain, Ahmed agreed to provide FBI agents with details.  The special training he received in bin Laden's camps included urban warfare, assassination, sabotage, hijacking and the destruction of the U.S. infrastructure. Targets included airports, airlines, the financial markets and New York City. American airports and commercial jetliners would be used as weapons in the attack.  Bin Laden, he warned, would soon unleash an incomprehensible horror on the people of the United States (29). During November/December of 1999, and January/February of 2000 U.S. Intelligence tracked and then followed Ziad al-Jarrah, Mohammed Atta, and Marwan al-Shehhi as they left Germany, then boarded Turkish Airlines Flight 1662. In the company of another al-Qaeda operative, bin al-Shibh, they flew from Istanbul to Karachi, Pakistan where they met with officials of the ISI. These men remained under surveillance for several more days, and were then tracked to an al-Qaeda training camp Afghanistan (30). Atta, it is believed, was the leader of the four 9/11 hijacking teams. Based on information apparently supplied by al-Jarrah, or other spies within al-Qaeda, the CIA learned that Atta and the other men met with Osama bin laden and that Atta was treated as honored guest. Subsequently Atta was tape recorded by the CIA discussing with another known terrorist, a forthcoming attack on the United States. On his last call to Germany, in September of 2001, Atta alerted his friend Bin-al-Shibh that a date for the attack had been selected, using the code words "Two sticks, a dash and a cake with a stick down," meaning 11-9 or September 11 (31).  Following their visit in 1999, the three men did not return to Germany, until February 2000, at which point they began using the internet to send and receive information from flight schools in the United States. Over 30 different schools were contacted (32). A Hamburg librarian later claimed she overhead Al-Shehhi speaking of the World Trade Center and then boasting: "There will be thousands of dead. You will all think of me" (32).  During January of 2000, the CIA tracked Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi to Malaysia, where a high level al-Qaeda conference was to be held (33). The CIA ordered Malaysian Intelligence to photograph the participants, which included a one-legged member of al-Qaeda, Tawfiq Attash Khallad. Khallad was a top bin Laden lieutenant and the chief planner of the October 1998 bombing of the USS Cole. Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi were photographed talking with Khallad. After the meeting, Khallad provided funds, and paid for the plane tickets of al-Hazmi and al-Midhar, to America (33).  Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi were also photographed talking with bin al-Shibh, the same man who had accompanied Atta, al-Shehhi, and Ziad al-Jarrah to Afghanistan. Bin al-Shibh would later wire $115,000 to the Florida bank accounts of Atta and Al-Shehhi (33), and an as yet undisclosed sum of cash to Zacarias Moussaoui (the so called "20th hijacker").  All this information, including the fact that Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi had entered the United States soon after attending an al-Qaeda conference in Malaysia, was passed on to the FBI's counterterrorism center at FBI headquarters in January 2000 (33). The plotters proceeded to carry out their activities unmolested, on the orders of FBI headquarters, much to the distress of FBI field operatives.  In fact, one unidentified FBI agent from the agency's New York office, speaking from behind a glass partition, said that he warned his superiors that "someone would die" unless the government more aggressively investigated the mysterious trail of al-Midhar (33).  Khalid al-Midhar and would later take part in the 9/11 hijackings.  The FBI and CIA were again made aware of the possibility that terrorists linked to bin Laden might hijack jets and crash them into public buildings, early in 2000. Prior to the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, the FBI and CIA officials were consulted about the danger of 3a fully loaded, fueled airliner crashing into the opening ceremony before a worldwide television audience,2 during the 2000 Olympic Games. Sydney police superintendent Paul McKinnon reported that Osama bin Laden was considered the number one threat. According to IOC officials plane-crash catastrophes have been incorporated into security planning for every Olympics since 1972. 3That was our nightmare scenario2 (34).  IOC officials also held detailed discussions with the FBI about the dangers of hijacked airlines crashing into buildings and crowed stadiums. These discussion were held early in 2001 in preparing security for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City (34).  On August 12, 2000, Italian police and US Intelligence officials, using wiretaps, listened as a Yemeni al-Qaeda operative explained to an Egyptian operative based in Italy, about a massive strike against the enemies of Islam involving aircraft, an attack that "will be written about in all the newspapers of the world...This will be one of those strikes that will never be forgotten.... This is a terrifying thing. This is a thing that will spread from south to north, from east to west: The person who came up with this program is a madman from a madhouse, a madman but a genius. He is fixated on this program; it will leave everyone turned to ice. In the future, listen to the news and remember these words: The danger in the airports.... in that country, the fire has been lit and is awaiting only the wind." In January of 2001, Ziad al-Jarrah, was tracked and then intercepted by CIA officials. As reported by CNN (35), "Jarrah had spent at least three weeks in January 2001 at an al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan." Upon completing his terrorist training the CIA, which had been monitoring his movements, requested that intelligence officials based in the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, question him about "his terrorist activities." According to CNN (35), the CIA had "Jarrah stopped at the airport in Dubai on January 30, 2001, after the CIA notified officials that he would be arriving from Pakistan on his way back to Europe." The CIA questioned, debriefed, and then allowed him to return to Europe and from Europe to the United States where he began taking flight training lessons.  On 9/11, Ziad al-Jarrah piloted the hijacked jet that crashed in Pennsylvania.  In February of 2001, the Federal Aviation Administration1s annual report on Criminal Acts Against Aviation, warned that "bin Laden... has both the motivation and the wherewithal to.... attack civil aviation. Bin Laden1s anti-Western and anti-American attitudes make him and his followers a significant threat to civil aviation, particularly to US civil aviation.2  In May, June and July of 2001, the Bush administration received specific and credible information indicating that commercial jetliners would soon be hijacked by Islamic terrorists. Specifically, in May and June, American intelligence intercepted a number of communications between al-Qaeda members. The upcoming attacks were repeatedly discussed. One al-Qaeda operative is quoted as stating that it would be more devastating than "Hiroshima" (33).  In June of 2001, Osama bin Laden openly boasted of a horrific attack that would soon take place in the United States.  In June, according to the German daily Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung (36), German intelligence agencies, the BND, relying on information gleaned from an electronic eavesdropping system known as Echelon, warned the CIA that Middle Eastern terrorists were "planning to hijack commercial aircraft to use as weapons to attack important symbols of American culture." In July, Kenneth Williams, an FBI agent in Phoenix concluded a painstaking investigation. He had uncovered detailed information that linked a number of Middle Eastern flight students to Osama bin Laden and to a radical British Islamic group, Al-Muhajiroun. Al-Muhajiroun is dedicated to the establishment of a global Muslim state through Islamic terror and the overthrow and destruction of all non-Islamic governments. Moreover, he discovered that one of the flight school students had communicated with Abu Zubaydah, one of al-Qaeda's senior leaders (33).  On July 10, Williams sent FBI headquarters a detailed report warning that Osama bin Laden's followers may be training in U.S. flight schools. He further reported that these men had been inquiring about airport security, and that they may be planning to hijack commercial jetliners. Williams strongly urged the FBI to canvass all flight schools in the United States and to identify students with possible terrorist ties. ****** On July 15, 2001, while receiving treatment for liver and renal dysfunction, at the American hospital in Dubai, Osama bin Laden was interviewed by a CIA agent. As detailed by United Press International (44), Radio France International (45) and Le Figaro (43), Bin Laden reportedly checked into the American Hospital on July 4, received dialysis and related treatment, and checked out on July 14. During his 10 day stay, bin Laden met with family members and a stream of local dignitaries, including a well known local CIA agent. These publications, citing French intelligence officials, claim that similar meetings had been taking place for years: "the CIA maintained contacts with bin Laden...Those contacts didn't end after bin Laden moved to Afghanistan" (43). According to French Intelligence officials, bin Laden provided "precise information" to the CIA about an imminent attack on the US" as well as details about an attack on the U.S. embassy in Paris which two weeks later resulted in the arrest of Djamel Beghal who later "confessed to receiving his orders from bin Laden" (44).  After the meeting with bin Laden, on July 15, the CIA agent was called back to the CIA's McLean, Virginia headquarters.  In July, National Security Advisor, Rice, and "terrorism czar" Richard Clarke, met with other security officials, and then issued a secret "super alert" warning that the U.S. would soon be attacked and that U.S. aircraft might be hijacked as part of a coordinated terrorist assault.  Attorney General, John Ashcroft took the warnings so seriously that on July 26, 2001, he broke with tradition and refused, from that day on, to ever again fly on any commercial jets.  When the Justice Dept. was questioned by CBS News correspondent Jim Stewart, about this unusual move, they issued a terse reply: Because of a "threat assessment" by the FBI. Yet when pressed by CBS, "neither the FBI nor the Justice Department... would identify what the threat was, when it was detected or who made it." When Ashcroft was directly asked by reporters about the "threat" he replied with a straight face: "Frankly, I don't," know anything about it, he told reporters.  Are we supposed to believe that Ashcroft quit flying commercial and instead would only fly on a $1,600-plus per hour private G-3 Gulfstream, because of a "threat" that he knew nothing about?  Of course, the Bush administration, and the corporate controlled American mass media, would have us believe that it is absolutely preposterous that bin Laden would have met with a CIA agent. After all, he is an outcast who is even shunned by his family--or so we are told. Indeed, if bin Laden wasn't an outcast, if he was in contact with the CIA and his family who stood to make a lot of money following 9/11, that would be embarrassing to the Bush administration given that Bush Sr. has stayed at the bin Laden palace, as recently as 2000 (40). In fact, Frank Carlucci, former assistant director of the CIA, and James Baker, held a meeting with at least one of the bin Laden brothers on the morning of 9/11/2001 (41). Frank Carlucci, who is closely plugged in to the current Bush administration, may have even held meetings with Osama bin Laden back when Frank was a deputy director of the CIA.  As detailed in previous chapters, Osama's association with the CIA and the U.S. began in the late 1970s and continued throughout the 1980s, where he served U.S. and Saudi interests in the proxy war with the Soviet Union in Afghanistan (38). In 1996, at the request of the U.S., and the Saudi government, he left the Sudan, and then flew to Afghanistan (38). Saudi Prince Bandar denies that an arrest warrant was ever issued for Osama bin Laden (39).  In 1996, Osama was still working with Western Intelligence and was given several assignments by British, Saudi, and U.S. Intelligence agencies, one of which included an assassination plot against Libyan leader, Colonel Gadaffi (39). As detailed by The Observer (39), "British intelligence paid large sums of money to an al-Qaeda cell in Libya in a doomed attempt to assassinate Colonel Gadaffi."  As noted, and as confirmed by Saudi Prince Bandar, the Saudi government never issued an arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden. As we independently confirmed, it was Libya which issued the warrant! However, British intelligence, in consultation with the CIA, quashed the "Interpol arrest warrant for bin Laden" issued by Libya (39).  We should also remember that Osama bin Laden is a business man.  As to Bush administration and corporate news accounts claiming there is no contact between Osama and his family, in actuality, phone calls between Osama and his family, this is nonsense. Calls between him and his brothers and his mother, have been repeatedly intercepted by U.S. Intelligence agencies (42). Bin Laden has been repeatedly tape recorded by the CIA and National Security Agency, talking with family members, including his mother. Moreover, bin Laden family members, including some of the Princes of the Saudi Royal family, have visited Osama in Afghanistan, and in Dubai of the United Arab Emirates (43), where Osama and his family, and the Saudis have banking and business interests.  It is precisely because it is so well known to all but the American public, that bin Laden regularly spends time in Dubai, on business, coupled with our knowledge of the close working relationship he has maintained in the past with the CIA, that we find reports that he met with a CIA agent in Dubai, in July, 2001, highly credible.  Again, and as will be detailed in chapters 12 and 13, Osama bin laden is not the leader of al-Qaeda. He is a business man, and his family, like the Bush family, like Prince Bandar, stood to make a lot of money following the 9/11 attacks.  ******  During the following weeks, and continuing up to the very day before 9/11, the Bush administration received an avalanche of warnings that commercial jets would be hijacked and slammed into U.S. cities, including New York and the World Trade Center.  In August of 2001, Israeli intelligence services, including the Mossad, became aware that al-Qaeda was planning a large-scale terror attack on America. The Los Angeles Times subsequently discovered that Israel's Mossad had passed on warnings to U.S. officials that as many as 200 terrorists linked to al-Qaeda had slipped into the country and were preparing to launch a major assault on the United States. "Everybody knew about a heightened alert, and knew that bin Laden was preparing a big attack," admitted an administration official on conditions of anonymity.  When asked by reporters if it was true that Israel had shared this frightening information with U.S. intelligence agencies, Mark Regev, Israel's ambassador to the United States reluctantly admitted that: "Israel routinely shares with the U.S. intelligence information concerning the field of counter terrorism. We also have been closely watching bin Laden and people were aware of the threat he poses."  After the September 11 assault, when confronted by newspaper reporters about this startling revelation, the CIA officially denied receiving advance warning: "That is utter nonsense," responded Bill Harlow, CIA spokesman. CIA denials were seconded by senior Israeli government officials: "There was no specific information about the intention to carry out such an attack," the official said. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, however, told the New York Times that his country's intelligence service also warned U.S. officials during the first days of August. They warned that al-Qaeda was in the advanced stages of an attack on American. On August 1, actor James Woods, while a passenger on a flight from Boston to Los Angeles, became alarmed by the behavior of four men who he thought were intending on hijacking the plane. Later, it was determined that all four were among those who hijacked the 4 commercial jet liners on 9/11. According to Mr. Woods, during a February 2002, television interview with Bill O'Reilly of Fox TV's O'Reilly Factor, "....what made me suspicious of these four men... would have been blatantly obvious to the most casual observer. I took it upon myself to go to the flight attendant and ask to speak to the pilot of the plane. The first officer came out. I reported to him that I felt that the four men.... I said I think they're going to hijack this plane.... I explained to him these details, which I've been asked to keep private..." Woods insists that a report was filed by the flight crew in early August, and that the report went directly to the FAA regarding the suspicious behavior of the four men.  It is standard procedure for the FAA to pass this information on to the FBI.  According to Mr. Woods, after he contacted the FBI, following the 9/11 hijacking, to see if the men he had been identified were in fact the hijackers, he had been cautioned to keep this information secret because it might compromise national security. However, the FBI agent he spoke to, informed him that "I have identified for sure two of them as two of the terrorists." Woods then went on to say: "I've been told unofficially, not by the FBI, but by someone else in a higher level of government... that all four of them were terrorists involved. O'Reilly: "So it was basically a rehearsal, what these guys were doing?  Woods: "Right. But what's significant about this is that it was a rehearsal with four men." Thus, in early August, four of the 9/11 hijackers had been identified as obviously planning to hijack a commercial jet! This information was passed on to the FBI.  On August 6, the CIA warned President Bush, in a detailed memo, that al-Qaeda was planning to hijack commercial jets.  In mid-August 2001, the FBI received repeated and insistent warnings from managers of the Pan Am International Flight School in Eagan, Minnesota about Zacarias Moussaoui, who was requesting training in a Boeing 747 simulator but who only wanted to learn how to steer the jet and had no interest in learning about landings or takeoffs (46,47).  On August 17, Zacarias Moussaoui, was arrested. Based on the information received from the flight school, FBI field agents contacted French intelligence officials and were informed that Zacarias Moussaoui was a suspected terrorist and a fanatical believer in Islam (47). When FBI headquarters was contacted, high level officials then proceeded to block and "sabotage" any attempt to continue investigating Moussaoui. A supervisor in the Minnesota FBI field office warned FBI headquarters that they were trying to stop terrorists who are planning "to take control of a plane and fly it into the World Trade Center" (47).  FBI headquarters responded angrily: "That's not going to happen." Later, Special Agent and Minneapolis Chief Division Counsel Coleen M. Rowley, accused FBI director Mueller and the FBI of a "coverup " for "political reasons" and stated in a letter that other agents were accusing FBI headquarters of "deliberate" sabotage. "Jokes were actually made that the key FBIHQ personnel had to be spies or moles.. who were actually working for Osama Bin Laden" (46).  In late August, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian intelligence to warn the U.S. government "in the strongest possible terms" of imminent attacks on airports and government buildings (48).  On September 7, the French Secret Service warned U.S. officials of an attack that was being orchestrated from Afghanistan (43). French officials were puzzled that the U.S. did not take the warnings seriously.  Between September 6-10, 2001 there was a dramatic and abnormal 600% increase in sales of put options on commercial air line stocks--betting that the stock will go down (49,50). Over 4,700 put options were purchased on United Air Lines stock as opposed to only 396 call options (betting the stock will go up). On September 10, 2001 over 4,500 put options are purchased on American Airlines as compared to 748 call options.  When purchasing Put options, one is buying, for a very minimal fee, the right to sell a stock, at a fixed price, for a limited time period. For example, if a stock is selling at $50.00 per share, one might buy the right to sell that stock at $45.00 per share. The right to sell the stock at this price, might cost $1.00 per share instead of $45.00 per share. If the stock goes up, one loses a dollar. But if the stock drops, say to $35.00, and if one has bought the equivalent of a thousand shares, for one thousand dollars, then by selling the stock at $45.00 per share (when its value is now $35.00) this would result in nearly a $10,000 profit. If one has purchased the equivalent of 10,000 shares, and the value drops by 50%, the profits would be staggering.  After 9/11, United Airlines and American Airlines stock, dropped propitiously. The individual or individuals who had purchased those puts, stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars.  The Wall Street Journal reports (49) that 2,000 United Airlines put option were purchased through Deutschebank-Alex Brown on September 6, 2001. According to the magazine, Baron1s (50), another 2,500 puts purchased through Deutschebank were "split into 500 chunks each, directing each order to different U.S. exchanges around the country simultaneously."  Obviously, those purchasing these put options knew that their value would soar on 9/11.  Unusual stock trades are actively monitored, in real time, via highly advanced computer software programs, by U.S. and foreign Intelligence Services, including the FBI, CIA, and Justice Department. In this instance, we are supposed to believe that this activity went unnoticed.  For reasons that the Bush administration refuses to explain, the Security and Exchange Commission, the FBI, and the CIA, have been unable to determine who purchased these options.  It has been suggested that Deutschebank-Alex Brown, where many of these options were purchased, is either being uncooperative or it lost or misplaced any records that would shed light on the purchaser's identity--which is a brazen absurdity, and which raises questions about Deutschebank-Alex Brown.  According to articles in the German news weekly Der Spiegel (51), the Asian Wall Street Journal (52), and Britain1s The Guardian (53), the bin Laden family maintains a least 10 different accounts with Deutschebank, with a value of over $100 million dollars. Funds from some of these 10 accounts, German authorities suspect, have funded the terrorist activities of bin Laden's al-Qaeda.  The Deutschebank is also in business with the CIA. One month before 9/11, the Financial Times of Asia, Wire-Business Line (54), carried an article which directly linked Deutschebank to the CIA, as well as to unnamed individuals in Afghanistan.  The CIA connection is not a secret. As openly admitted by the CIA, that connection goes by the name of "Buzzy" Krongard. On March 26, 2001, "Buzzy" Krongard was named Executive Director of the CIA. "Buzzy" has an interesting history. He had been Chairman of the investment bank A.B. Brown which was acquired by Banker1s Trust in 1997. Krongard then became Vice Chairman of Banker1s Trust-AB Brown--a banking company many, including Senator Carl Levin, have accused of being involved in money laundering. The same has been said of Deutschebank (54).  Just 32 days before the attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, the Financial Times of Asia Wire-Business Line, published an article linking Deutschebank to the CIA, and to Pakistani and Afghani heroin smuggling. High level officials at Deutschebank were involved in money laundering of narcotics proceeds (54).  Deutschebank owns Banker1s Trust-AB Brown, whose former chairman and vice-chairman is the current Executive Director of the CIA, "Buzzy" Krongard.  According to the CIA, "Mr. Krongard had previously worked in various capacities at Alex Brown Incorporated, the nation1s oldest investment banking firm and assumed the additional duties of Chairman of the Board in 1994, and in September 1997, Mr. Krongard became Vice Chairman of the Board of Bankers Trust and served in such capacity until joining CIA." On September 7, 2001, the French secret service warned the CIA of possible attacks, provided very precise information as to the targets, and revealed that the order to act would come from Afghanistan (43). On September 9, 2001, the NSA intercepted a telephone call between Osama Bin Laden and his mother, Al Kalifa bin Laden, in which he said "In two days you're going to hear big news, and you're not going to hear from me for a while" (33).  On September 10, 2001, the NSA overheard and tapped two phone calls from al-Qaeda operatives, one of whom said: "the match will be lit [begins] tomorrow" whereas in the second call it was stated: "Tomorrow is zero day" (33). On Sept. 10, a group of top Pentagon officials suddenly canceled travel plans for the next morning, apparently because of security concerns.  On September 11, 2001, approximately two hours before the first jet struck the World Trade Center, employees of an Israeli company, Odigo, Inc. one of the world1s largest instant messaging companies, with offices in New York, received warnings of an imminent attack on the WTC. Odigo, Inc., is headquartered in the city of Herzliyya, which is also the headquarters for the Israeli Institute for Counter Terrorism (55,56). 3Officials at instant-messaging firm Odigo confirmed today that two employees received text messages warning of an attack on the World Trade Center two hours before terrorists crashed planes into the New York landmarks2 (56).  In other words, everybody knew about the attack--everybody, except the Bush administration.  EVERYBODY KNEW EXCEPT BUSH?  Despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the CIA, FBI, and the Bush administration have repeatedly denied having any advanced warning, even though, as we know, in July, Ashcroft became too frightened to fly on commercial jetliners.  "My view is that the information we now have do not indicate that there was a substantial likelihood of detecting this," Ashcroft said on ABC's "This Week."  "It's hard to envision a plot so devious as the one that they pulled off on 9/11," Bush said in a January interview with NBC's Tom Brokaw. "Never did we realize that the enemy was so well organized."  "I don't think anybody could have predicted that ... they would try to use an airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a missile," said National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice.  "We were unable to marry any information from investigations or the intelligence community that talked to their use of this expertise in the events that we saw unfold on the 11th," an administration official said. Not only had the Bush administration received specific, detailed information, and innumerable warnings from a variety of sources, but they had been repeatedly warned that al-Qaeda was training pilots and planning to hijack commercial jetliners--which is why Attorney General Ashcroft refused to ever step foot in a commercial jet again. The Bush administration knew with absolute certainty there would be an attack. The claims to the otherwise are absurdities.  "We all predicted this," said Jerry Bremer, a former State Department terrorism expert and former chairman of a national commission on terrorism. "We had strategic warnings. This is not something the analysts missed."  As summed up by Larry Johnson, former deputy director of the State Department's office of counterterrorism, Bush, Ashcroft, and "Rice are foolish in saying that. Intelligence analysts are paid to imagine the unimaginable. That information was in their files, and if they weren't imagining it, that is a failure of intelligence and a failure of imagination." Other former terrorism experts agreed. The warning signs were not only obvious but a 1999 analysis commissioned by The National Intelligence Agency and written for the CIA, predicted that Osama bin Laden would attack the U.S. "in a spectacular way. Suicide bombers belonging to al Qaeda's martyrdom battalion could crash-land an aircraft packed with high explosives into the Pentagon headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency, or the White House," the report said.  Not only had the Bush team received a tidal wave of warnings, but the hijacking of American aircraft and the murder of Americans had been proposed by the CIA and the U.S. military, as a means of justifying war with other nations.  When the credibility of these obvious Bush administration falsehoods were challenged, FBI director, Mueller, was willing to offer only the most feeble of excuses: "We have to do a better job pulling these pieces together, analyzing them and disseminating them," Mueller told CBS's "Face the Nation."  Excuses, of course, are like assholes, and everyone in the Bush administration has one.  Even some Republicans were not buying the Bush administration excuse-machine.  "They don't have any excuse because the information was in their lap and they didn't do anything to prevent it," said Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, on NBC's "Meet the Press."  "I don't believe any longer that it's a matter of connecting the dots. I think they had a veritable blueprint and we want to know why they didn't act on it." - Republican Senator Arlen Specter, 6/6/02  Finally, the truth, and from Republicans: The Bush administration knew in advance, "they had a veritable blueprint... and they didn't do anything to prevent it."  "Of course President Bush knew about the impending attacks on America. He did nothing to warn the American people because he needed this war on terrorism. His daddy had Saddam and he needed Osama. His presidency was going nowhere. He wasn't elected by the American people, but placed into the Oval Office by the conservative Supreme Court. The economy was sliding into the usual Republican pits and he needed something on which to hang his presidency... This guy is a joke. What is sleazy and contemptible is the President of the United States not telling the American people what he knows for political gain." - Air Force Lt. Col. Steve Butler, Monterey Herald (5/26/02). Even Bush's White House Spokesman, Ari Fleischer admitted that Bush knew in advance: "The president was provided information about bin Laden wanting to engage in hijacking." Of course he knew.  However, he claims that although he knew, what he didn't know was that the planes would be used to kill people.  "Had I known that the enemy was going to use airplanes to kill on that fateful morning," Bush said, "I would have done everything in my power to protect the American people." In other words, Bush has basically admitted that he knew that aircraft would be hijacked "on that fateful morning," but that he didn't know "the enemy was going to use airplanes to kill." What the Bush White House also knew in advance, is that the nation was about to undergo yet another terrorist attack, this one involving military grade anthrax.  THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TAKES CIPRO ON 9/11/2001  Top officials in the Bush administration, began taking the anti-anthrax medication, Cipro, weeks before the first attack was made public, that is, on the morning of 9/11/2001 (57,58). "On the night of the September 11 attacks, the White House Medical Office dispensed Cipro to staff accompanying Vice President Dick Cheney as he was secreted off to the safety of Camp David, and told them it was a �precaution,1 according to one person directly involved2 (57).  By taking Cipro on 9/11/2001, one week before the first anthrax was even mailed, and three weeks before the first anthrax attacks became public, the Bush White House has essentially "ducked before the bomb went off" thus demonstrating that they knew that an anthrax bomb had been planted and was about to go off. The Bush administration obviously had advanced knowledge that the anthrax attacks were about to begin.  "We believe that the White House knew or had reason to know that an anthrax attack was imminent or under way." --Larry Klayman, Chairman of Judicial Watch (58). Of course the Bush administration knew in advance that an anthrax attack was in the works. Note that they did not take antidotes for smallpox or other biological weapons. Only anthrax.  The Bush administration not only knew in advance, they welcomed the fact that the American public would be terrorized, which is why they were careful to ensure that they, and they alone, would be protected.  BUSH UNLOCKS & OPENS DOOR TO TERRORISTS: AIR FORCE & FAA TOLD TO STAND DOWN  A super terrorist alert was issued in July of 2001, and there followed an avalanche of warnings, including those delivered by the French and the Presidents of Egypt and Russia. Inexplicably, in the midst of this super terrorist alert, the Bush administration began ordering the FAA and Air Force to step down and to relax their vigilance.  By the morning of 9/11, the step down was not just complete but was so relaxed it was in violation of all normal operating procedures. That morning, in direct contravention of established policy, only eight aircraft were assigned "ready" duty for air patrol for the entire continental United States. And, in direct contravention of established policy, none of the eight were military, and all were sitting on the ground. None of the eight planes were in the air that morning.  At 8:13, on the morning of 9/11, the pilots of Flight 11 stopped responding to air traffic controllers. Flight 11 had been hijacked, and most certainly this had been communicated to controllers while the hijackings were in progress some minutes before. However, exactly what was said is unknown as the Bush administration refuses to release the tapes.  Seven minutes later, at 8:20, Flight 11 stopped transmitting its IFF beacon signal while over the Hudson River.  At 8:24, one of the hijackers accidentally activated the aircraft's radio instead of its public-address system, and then said: "We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you will be OK. We are returning to the airport. Nobody move."  An Air traffic controller then responded: "Who's trying to call me?" Then from Flight 11, "Everything will be OK. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet."  At 8:25 Boston Air Traffic Control notifies several air traffic control centers that a hijack is in progress.  At 8:27, Betty Ong, a flight attendant on Flight 11, calls American Airlines reservations from the seat-back phone. "Two flight attendants had been stabbed," she said. "A passenger had his throat slashed and looked dead... the hijackers... had gotten into the cockpit."  Another 13 minutes go by, 26 have passed in total. In direct contravention of established policy, all interceptor craft were still on the ground. Neither the National Guard, the FAA, or the Air Force had responded.  At 8:40 Boston's air traffic control center notifies NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector in Rome, N.Y. that Flight 11 has been hijacked.  At the same time, Flight 175 is in the process of being hijacked.  Still, there is no response from the NORAD et al.  At 8:42 Flight 175 veered from it's course over New Jersey.  At 8:43 the FAA notified NORAD that Flight 175 had been hijacked.  At 8:46 Flight 11 slams into the north tower of the World Trade Center.  Thirty three minutes (or more) have elapsed since Flight 11 was hijacked and all interceptor flights are still grounded.  For the last 30 years it has been standard FAA procedure to immediately scramble U.S. fighters to immediately intercept any errant or non-responsive aircraft. For example, on October 25, 1999, when a jet carrying golfer Payne Stewart flew off course and toward the White House, it was intercepted 21 minutes later by two F-16s. On July 16, 2002, two F-16s were dispatched and intercepted a transcontinental flight, within 17 minutes after being alerted that a group of entertainers from India on a flight to New York were getting boisterous and overly excited.  On the morning of 9/11, it was not until 8:46 that NORAD awakened from its slumber. Inexplicably, another six minutes passed, and then at 8:52 two F-15 fighters were finally scrambled from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts, 153 miles from New York in a failed effort to intercept the two hijacked planes.  Thus, we see that whereas it usually takes 17 to 21 minutes, on average, to intercept a plane after being notified of problems, on the morning of 9/11, it took 39 minutes before the military even put a single plane into the air, and only after the first jet struck the north tower.  The result of the Bush-ordered stand-down in the middle of a super terrorist alert, and this inexplicable delay in reaction on the morning of 9/11, was to allow all hijackings to proceed and to enable the hijackers to complete their mission and to maximize casualties.  DID THE FBI "GOOF"? The CIA and FBI want us to believe that they "goofed." The Bush administration asks us to believe that unnecessary and restrictive laws, which prevent American intelligence agencies from looking at magazines, going to Mosques, or visiting websites on the internet, are the reasons for these "goof ups."  We are told that we have too much freedom, too many civil liberties, that there are too many laws protecting unnecessary "rights" and that it is these overly restrictive laws which have prevented the FBI and CIA from connecting the dots; and the corporate controlled American media repeats these absurdities unchallenged.  On the contrary, the reason top officials in the CIA, FBI, and Bush administration failed to connect the dots, is because they are the dots.  Indeed, the Bush family has been partnering with terrorists for decades, using murderers, rapists, gangsters, and the like, in innumerable operations which were designed to increase the power and wealth of the Bush clan and their associates.  The Bush family even partnered with the Nazis, and maintained that partnership after Hitler declared war on the United States and began killing Americans. For the Bush clan, it was business as usual. War is good for business, and if Americans are killed, then what of it, so long as in the end the Bush family makes money and increases their power.  In 1990, George H.W. Bush and his administration, began laying the ground work for the first major terrorist attack ever, on U.S. soil. That attack took place in 1993, when the World Trade Center was first bombed. Their intention was to blame the attack on Saddam Hussein (59), so as to justify war with Iraq during Bush's second term.  Unfortunately, for the Bush gang, they were unable to capitalized on the carnage, as Bush lost the 1992 elections. George H.W. Bush, his business partners, and the criminals that were part of his administration, would have to wait another 8 years to strike again, which they did, on 9/11/2001.  And just as the Bush gang originally planned to blame Saddam (57) and hide the involvement of their 1993 co-conspriators, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, the Bush gang, post 9/11, has again followed the same recipe. Instead of going after those who financed the attack, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, they have hidden and shifted the blame, away from their partners in crime, in order to target Afghanistan, and then Iraq--and they have done so in order to reap the profits of war and to hide their own complicity.  THE COVER UP BEGINS: THE GHOSTS OF NIXON'S PAST.  "Key FBI HQ personnel... continued to, almost inexplicably, throw up roadblocks and undermine Minneapolis' desperate efforts... to stop terrorists...." who planned "to take control of a plane and fly it into the World Trade Center."  After 9/11, there was a "Cover up.2 3A shading/skewing of facts by you and others at the highest levels of FBI management has occurred. Facts... have... been omitted, downplayed, glossed over and/or mis-characterized in an effort to avoid personal and/or institutional embarrassment on the part of the FBI and/or... for improper political reasons.2 3Key FBI Headquarters personnel had to be spies or moles.. who were actually working for Osama Bin Laden." The words above are those an FBI supervisor, and Coleen M. Rowley, FBI Special Agent & Chief Division Counsel, used to describe the FBI and FBI Director Mueller in the weeks before and during the aftermath of 9/11.  Mr. Mueller, as Coleen M. Rowley's has pointed out, has also promoted and rewarded the top level FBI officials who sabotaged the efforts of the Minneapolis' FBI office, from investigating the "20th" hijacker. Mr. Mueller is an accused "coverup" artist (60), who was brought into the Bush administration, and made FBI director, by Mr. George Bush. Mr. Mueller has a history of impeding justice, and covering up crimes committed by the Bush family and their associates (60). Mueller, was appointed by Mr. Bush for exactly that purpose. The same is true of the November 2002, appointment of Mr. Henry Kissinger, as the new Chairman of the Commission to investigate so called intelligence failures leading up to 9/11. Kissinger is no fan of democracy, and has been implicated in a variety of crimes. For example, Mr. Kissinger was accused by Congress, of obstruction of justice. In 1975, Otis Pike's Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, issued a contempt of Congress citation against Henry Kissinger for his refusal to provide documentation of covert operations. Kissinger and gang thumbed their noses at Pike.  Obstruction of justice is the least of his crimes. Mr. Henry Kissinger, as detailed in chapter 5, is one of those responsible for the torture and murder of hundreds of thousands of women, men, and children in East Timor, East Asia, and Chile (61,62,63). Kissinger is also one of those responsible for the assassination of Chile's democratically elected president, Allende (63). Kissinger and gang not only had Allende murdered, but Chile's top general after he announced he would uphold Chile's constitution.  With Kissinger, Rumsfeld, and Cheney, George Bush has ressurected the ghosts of Nixon's past and the inner circle of an administration which engaged in a host of nefarious crimes and impeachable offenses. In fact, the last time Kissinger, Rumsfeld, and Cheney worked together in the same administration, criminal wrong doing became so rampant, a Vice-President and a President had to resign.  Instead, Kissinger resigned from the 9-11 Commission, on December 13, 2002.  Despite the so far, successful cover-up of the Bush administration's involvement in the crimes of 9-11, there remains the possibility that the current president and vice-president might suffer the same fate as the last ones that Kissinger, Cheney, and Rumsfled had served.  WE CHARGE YOU WITH TREASON & MASS MURDER  We believe it is clear that the Bush administration knew of these planned hijackings in advance, and conspired to allow this tragedy to take place, in order to proft from it financially and politically.  For example, although the Bush administration was overwhelmed with an avalanche of detailed warnings of the upcoming hijackings, this same administration and top FBI officials repeatedly interfered with FBI agents, such as John O'Neil, including in particular those who were making "desperate efforts... to stop terrorists...." who planned "to take control of a plane and fly it into the World Trade Center." Some of these FBI agents accused officials at headquarters of being "spies or moles... working for bin Laden." After issuing a "Super Alert" in July this same Bush administration not only interfered with lower level FBI agents who were about to uncover the plot, but they ordered the FAA and the nation's military to stand down in the days before the 9/11 attack. The Bush administration essentially unlocked the door to our nation's security, and left it wide open.  The Bush family and Bush associates including the bin Ladens and the Saudi royal family, stand to make hundreds of millions of dollars in the aftermath of this tragedy. Indeed, these people are not only in business together, and some not only provided funds that ended up in the pockets of the hijackers, but they were holding high level meetings on the morning of 9-11.  Following 9-11, the Bush administration allowed the bin Laden to escape back to Saudi Arabia, where they cannot be questioned. As explained by Prince Bandar to CNN, in October of 2001, "His majesty said it's not fair for these innocent people to be subjected to any harm. So with the coordination of the FBI, we got them out."  Likewise, Prince Bandar, and the Saudi government refuse to allow the FBI to question the families of the 15 9/11 hijackers. When it was discovered that the Saudi government and Bandar's wife, Princess Haifa al-Faisal, was making regular monthly payments and provided over $100,000.000 each, to Osama Bassnan--a Saudi agent who in turn passed this money on to 9-11 hijackers, Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaq al-Hazmi--Osama Bassnan was immediately "deported" back to Saudi Arabia, thus making it impossible for the press or any investigative body, to question him.  We believe the evidence is clear.  Members of the current and past Bush administrations are in business with and have been in business with men and governments which kill Americans. Members of the current and past Bush administrations, including President Bush, made it possible for the 9-11 tragedy to take place, and they did so for personal and political gain.  The reason the FBI, CIA, and Bush administration failed to "Connect the Dots," is because they are the dots.  The only other alternative is to accept that the Bush administration, et al., are so incredibly incompetent, and so impossibly negligent, that they failed to take action and allowed this to happen out of foolishness and extreme stupidity. If that is the case, then this administration is so dumb that they pose a danger to themselves as well as the public.  We do not accept an explanation of criminal negligence.  Rather, based on the above and the wealth of facts detailed and documented in Part II of this book, we believe there is evidence sufficient to charge high ranking officials in the FBI, CIA, and Bush administration, with treason and the mass murder of nearly 3000 Americans on 9-11-2001.  We recommend the appointment of a special prosecutor and a new director of the FBI. We recommend Coleen M. Rowley, FBI Special Agent & Chief Division Counsel, as the ideal candidate to fill both posts.   NOTES  1). Charles J.

In this cable, Thomas Karamessines, CIA deputy director, conveys Kissinger's orders to Henry Hecksher, CIA station chief in Santiago, and includes the following statements: "It is firm and continuing policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup." The "operating guidance" is to hide the "American hand." The CIA is instructed to ignore any orders which are not consistent with this guidance cable. "CIA, Memorandum of Conversation of Meeting with Henry Kissinger, Thomas Karamessines, and Alexander Haig, October 15, 1970." This Memorandum includes a discussion of covert plans promoting a coup in Chile, and the overthrow of Allende, known as "Track II." Kissinger orders the CIA to "continue keeping the pressure on every Allende weak spot in sight."
