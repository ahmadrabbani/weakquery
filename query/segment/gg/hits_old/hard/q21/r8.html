    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Citing recommendations by the New Freedom Commission
    on Mental Health (NFC), George W. Bush wants to launch a nationwide mental
    illness screening program in government institutions, including the public
    school system, for all students from kindergarten up to the 12th grade.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The New Freedom Commission was established by an executive
    order Bush issued on April 29, 2002. According to a July 22, 2003, press
    release, the commission recommends transforming America's mental health
    care system.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Achieving this goal will require greater engagement
    and education of first line health care providers - primary care practitioners
    - and a greater focus on mental health care in institutions such as schools,
    child welfare programs, and the criminal and juvenile justice systems.
    The goal is integrated care that can screen, identify, and respond to problems
    early,&quot; the commission's press release stated.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the NFC, its recommendations are being already
    being promoted in Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut,
    Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky,
    Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
    New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
    South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia,
    Wisconsin, and Wyoming.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The truth is, this is nothing but another Bush profiteering
    scheme to implement a drug treatment program for use in the public institutions
    that will generate high volume sales of the relatively new, but inadequately
    tested, high-priced psychiatric drugs. If all goes as planned, the scheme
    will generate millions of new customers for the drug companies.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Original Scheme Hatched In Texas</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The commission's final report identifies what it claims
    are several model programs as examples of how aspects of mental health
    care have been transformed in selected communities.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>One program is the Texas Medication Algorithm Project
    (TMAP), a medication treatment program that screens people for mental illness
    and then prescribes highly profitably psychiatric drugs.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the plan came under intense scrutiny when it
    was implemented in the state of Pennsylvania. A whistle-blower by the name
    of Allen Jones*, who was an employee of the Pennsylvania office of Inspector
    General, published a report that described how medical leaders in Pennsylvania,
    who controlled the medication plan, received payments from the drug companies
    who were going to benefit from the plan.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Through the Texas scheme, drug companies were able to
    gain unlimited access to the Texas prison system, juvenile justice system,
    foster care program, and state mental health hospitals, to recruit new
    customers.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>In Texas, the list of medications to be prescribed was
    established by what was termed, an &quot;expert consensus&quot; and drugs
    recommended for first line treatment, included high-priced drugs such as
    Paxil, Zyprexa, Adderall, Zoloft, Risperdal, Seroqual, Depakote, Prozac,
    Wellbutron, Zyban, Remeron, Serzone, and Effexor.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>After securing access to the public systems, the next
    step in the Texas scheme was to get lawmakers to pass legislation to increase
    Medicaid coverage to persons who ordinarily would not qualify, in order
    to provide funding by way of tax dollars to pay for the drugs prescribed
    to customers within theses systems.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The fact is our children are already being overmedicated.
    According to a May 2003 report by The New York Times, &quot;National sales
    of anti-psychotics reached $6.4 billion in 2002, making them the fourth
    highest-selling class of drugs, behind cholesterol-lowering drugs, ulcer
    drugs and antidepressants.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The number of children on antidepressant medication increased
    by over 500 percent between 1999 and 2003. Antidepressants and anti-psychotics
    now constitute two of the four top classes of drug sales.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>For example, Zyprexa is manufactured by Eli Lilly and
    is one of the drugs on the list in Texas. In 2002, according to the watchdog
    group, NDC Health, &quot;more than 7.4 million prescriptions were written
    for Zyprexa.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>In 2003, it became Eli Lilly's top seller with worldwide
    sales of over $4 billion. According to The New York Times, 70 percent of
    the Zyprexa purchased in the US that year was paid for by government programs
    like Medicare and Medicaid.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Eli Lilly has well known ties to the Bush administration.
    After he left the CIA in 1977, Bush Senior became a member of Lilly's board
    of directors. When he left the company to become vice president under Reagan
    in 1980, he forgot to mention that he owned stock in the company at the
    same time that he was lobbying for tax breaks for the company, even though
    it manufactured drugs in Puerto Rico, where continental US-based companies
    pay no federal income taxes. Bush Junior made Eli Lilly CEO Sidney Taurel
    a member of the Homeland Security Council.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>During the 2000 presidential election year, Lilly gave
    over $1.5 million to political candidates and over 80 percent of that $1.5
    million went to Bush and other Republican candidates.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Many members of the New Freedom Commission also have
    ties to the pharmaceutical industry and have served on drug company advisory
    boards.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>What's In Store For Us</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The NFC appointed 15 subcommittees to review the mental
    health service delivery system and appointed a chairman for each one. Several
    other commissioners served on each subcommittee and chose experts to provide
    advice and support. The experts prepared discussion papers that outlined
    key issues and presented policy options for consideration by the full subcommittee.
    The subcommittee reported to the full commission only in summary form,
    on which the full commission reached a consensus on the policy options
    that would be included in its final report entitled, &quot;Achieving the
    Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>A February 5, 2003, summary report by the Policy Options
    Subcommittee on Medicaid began by stating, &quot;An effective and comprehensive
    mental health system must rely on many sources of financing. Many States
    have made significant use of flexibility in the Medicaid program to support
    their systems of care. This has resulted in Medicaid being the largest
    payer of public mental health services in the country.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The report outlined the following recommendations:</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Enhance Service Delivery</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>1. Public financing should support evidenced-based practices
    that are necessary and effective for successful community living.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>2. Medicaid financial incentives and opportunities for
    the most appropriate community-based care should be increased.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Enhance Service Planning and Coordination</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>1. Federal leadership should guide and facilitate improved
    planning among state agencies that fund and implement services for persons
    with mental illness.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>2. The federal government should assure proper data collection
    and reporting to facilitate and support mental health planning and quality
    management at all levels of the public mental health system.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>One February 5, 2003, report by a subcommittee titled,
    Promoting, Preserving and Restoring Children's Mental Heath, began in part,
    by saying, &quot;Mental health problems among children and adolescents
    constitute a public health crisis for our nation ... The extent, severity,
    and far-reaching consequences of mental health problems in children and
    adolescents make it imperative that our nation adopt a comprehensive, systematic,
    public health approach to improving the mental health status of children.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The approach, the report advised, should focus on &quot;both
    strengthening services and supports for children with serious emotional
    disorders and their families, and on prevention and early intervention
    strategies for all children.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The subcommittee wanted the federal and state governments
    to formulate a plan to (1) implement a cross-agency, comprehensive, public
    health approach for children's mental health at federal and state levels;
    (2) strengthen children's mental health focus in state governments; and
    (3) establish a federal interagency entity for children's mental health.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>As for funding, the subcommittee said: &quot;Federal
    and state agencies and commercial insurers should realign funding policies
    related to children's mental health to support a comprehensive array of
    services and supports, including home and community based services and
    supports that are individualized, family focused, coordinated, and culturally
    competent.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The subcommittee specified that a plan should be developed
    for Medicaid to support home and community-based services and support and
    individualized care, and maximize strategies to provide coverage and mental
    health care to uninsured children.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>In addition, the subcommittee wanted the government to
    provide technical assistance related to more efficient and effective implementation
    of early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Here's a good one. The subcommittee said we should strengthen
    federal and state requirements for family participation. &quot;Federal
    and state governments should promote a broader concept of 'mental health'
    services for children and adolescents with emotional disorders and their
    families,&quot; it advised.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Recognizing that children receive more services
    through schools than any other public system,&quot; the report recommended
    that &quot;federal, state, and local agencies should more fully recognize
    and address the mental health needs of youth in the education system.&quot;
    It advised, &quot;Likewise, these agencies should work collaboratively
    with families and develop, evaluate, and disseminate effective approaches
    for providing mental health services and supports to youth in schools.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The subcommittee recommended training teachers and school
    personnel to recognize signs of emotional problems in children and to make
    appropriate referrals for assessment and services. &quot;Systematic screening
    procedures to identify ... problems and treatment needs should be implemented
    in specific settings in which youngsters are at high risk for emotional
    disorders or where there is known to be a high prevalence of these or co-occurring
    mental health and substance abuse disorders,&quot; according to the report.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>And get this! Anyone involved in the juvenile justice
    system or welfare system is really in for trouble. &quot;Screening should
    be implemented upon entry into, and periodically thereafter in, the juvenile
    justice and child welfare systems, as well as in other settings and populations
    with known high risk, such as the Medicaid population. When mental health
    problems are identified, youth[s] should be linked with appropriate services
    and supports,&quot; the report advised.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>This gang of thugs is even coming up with ways to make
    money off infants shortly after they enter the world. This particular report
    recommends screening for all children ages 0 to 5 for social and emotional
    development as part of primary health care visits.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Mega-Bucks For Shrinks</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr Jane Orient, the executive director of the Association
    of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) has a few things to say about
    this latest profiteering scheme. &quot;Teams of experts are awaiting an
    infusion of cash,&quot; she says, &quot;They'll be ensconced in your child's
    school before you even know it.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Orient says an added &quot;bonus is that your little
    darlings will probably give them quite a bit of information about you also,
    and then you can receive therapy you didn't know you needed.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Orient, kids will be asked invasive personal
    questions like whether their parents raise their voice, or &quot;ever spank
    them? Have politically incorrect attitudes? Use forbidden words? Own a
    gun? Smoke cigarettes, especially indoors? Read extremist literature? Refuse
    to recycle? Prepare for a knock at the door.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>The answers to these questions could lead to a home visit
    with parents, and accusations of &quot;poor parenting skills, inadequate
    housekeeping, harmful literature, or a baby who is crying... ,&quot; Orient
    warns.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>She lists the many tools at the disposal of what she
    calls &quot;the mental health squad,&quot; including, &quot;Counseling
    sessions. Drugs. Group therapy. Removing the child from the home.&quot;
    Although removing a child from the home is listed as a last resort, the
    mere threat of it &quot;can accomplish wonders,&quot; Orient noted.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Student
    Health Center, privacy rights are essentially being ignored. The center
    is telling patients that if government agencies want to see their medical
    records, they get to review them without a patient's knowledge or consent.
    &quot;By law we cannot reveal when we have disclosed such information to
    the government,&quot; the center advised.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Screen Those In Dire Need First</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>If you want to see mental illness, just go knock on the
    door of the White House, or the Bush's home in Crawford, Texas. I recommend
    that we start this mandatory screening program with the Bush family.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Lets find some treatment for their deep-seated mental
    health problems. For instance, what rotten things happened in the Bush
    home that drove the twins to start drinking excessively while under age.
    And what emotional problems caused them to intentionally embarrass their
    father in a matter of months after he took office.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Then lets screen the president's nieces and nephews to
    see why Jeb's kids find it appropriate to forge prescriptions for drugs,
    and why his son would engage in underage sex in a car in a public shopping
    center parking lot. Or why Jeb's wife would try to smuggle in goods from
    other countries without paying the duty fees.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Then lets move on to brother Neil and have him screened
    to find out what compelled him to have sex with strange women who showed
    up at his hotel room doors in foreign countries, which resulted in a case
    of incurable venereal disease. And let's find out what possessed him to
    have an affair with his mother's secretary while both parties were still
    very married.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Next, let's line up members of the Bush administration
    and find out what compulsions need eradicating. Then let's continue on
    to the officials at the FDA and figure out what happened to their consciences,
    which allow them to promote medicating kids for profits.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Freedom My Butt</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>Granted, the &quot;New Freedom commission&quot; is a
    catchy title. However, words can be very deceptive. I fail to see how forcing
    people to undergo mental health testing can possibly represent freedom,
    or how drugging people for profit can be viewed as a form of freedom.</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>I agree with an article I read on NewsTarget.com that
    said, &quot;these people have lost their minds in a mad attempt to generate
    obscene profits regardless of the cost to human life, individual privacy,
    and human rights.&quot;</FONT>
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT SIZE=+1>* To the millions of doctors, parents and patients who
    will be affected, Allen Jones says educate yourselves. The Internet has
    many sites that will help you. The Alliance for Human Research Protection
    &lt;www.ahrp.org&gt;, would be a good place to start.</FONT>
