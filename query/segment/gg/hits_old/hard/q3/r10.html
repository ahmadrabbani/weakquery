	<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font face="Arial">Artificially Induced Fever</font></b></h3><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">&quot;Give me a chance to create a fever and I will cure any disease,&quot; said the great ancient physician Parmenides. Many modern giants of biological medicine in Europe, such as the Nobel Prize winner, Dr. A. Lwoff,41 famous German cancer specialist, Prof. Werner Zabel,42 and the director of the <b>most successful cancer clinic in the world</b>, the Ringberg-Klinik, Dr. Josef Issels, use artificially induced fever in their battle against cancer.42</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Dr. Werner Zabel told the following true story, which illustrates the <b>cancer-preventive and cancer-healing</b> effect of artificially induced fever:</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Not far from Rome, Italy, there were huge swampy areas called the Pontine Swamps. These swamps were excellent breeding grounds for malaria mosquitoes, and the whole area was affected by malaria.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Then, by government action, the Pontine Swamps were drained and dried out. As a result malaria completely disappeared. But Italian medical researchers made a remarkable observation. While earlier the whole malaria-infected area was <b>completely free from cancer</b>, now, one generation later, it had the same prevalence of cancer as the rest of Italy. The scientists concluded that the frequent fever attacks common in malaria stimulated the body's own defenses so that <b>cancer could not develop</b>.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Fever has been too long a misunderstood and mistreated symptom. Most orthodox doctors try to combat and suppress fever. Actually fever is a constructive, health-promoting symptom, initiated and created by the body in its own effort to fight infections and other conditions of disease and to restore health. High temperature speeds up metabolism, inhibits the growth of invading virus or bacteria and accelerates the healing processes.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In folk medicine in various parts of the world fever has been used for centuries to heal disease. In the West Indies, natives afflicted with syphilis or <b>cancer cured themselves</b> by deliberately subjecting themselves to infection from such high fever diseases as malaria, typhus fever or typhoid fever.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Dr. A. Lwoff, famous French bacteriologist, has demonstrated in repeated scientific experiments that fever is indeed a &quot;great medicine,&quot; and that it can help to cure many &quot;incurable diseases&quot;. In biological clinics in Europe, artificially induced fever, mostly in the form of overheating baths, has been used successfully to treat such conditions as rheumatic diseases, skin disorders, insomnia, arthritis - and <b>cancer</b>. Dr. Josef Issels has said, &quot;Artificially induced fever has the greatest potential in the treatment of many diseases, <b>including cancer</b>.&quot; Mark well that <b>this remark is made by one of the leading cancer specialists in the world!</b></font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The usual method of inducing fever is the so-called Schlenzbath.43 The patient is totally immersed in a large bathtub filled with water between 100-102<b> </b>degrees Fahrenheit. Only the nose and mouth are left free for breathing. In about half an hour, the body's temperature will gradually rise to match the temperature of the water.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Needless to say, treatment should be given by the nurse and should be well supervised. The temperature of the water and of the patient, and the patient's pulse, should be checked periodically.<b> </b>Detailed instructions for administering the Schlenz-bath are given in my book, <b>How To Get Well</b>.43</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p><i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The following section comes from the book by Paavo Airola, Ph.D., N.D., <u><a target="_blank" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0932090036/alkalizeforhealt">How to Get Well</a></u>, Health Plus Publishers, Sherwood, Oregon, 1993. The letters &quot;N.D.&quot; after Dr. Airola's name indicate that he is a &quot;Naturopathic Doctor&quot;. Naturopathic physicians have long been interested in alternative treatments for cancer and may be of great assistance to you.</font></p></i><p align="center"><font face="Arial">Directions: 7</font></p><h3 align="center"><b><font face="Arial">THERAPEUTIC BATHS</font></b></h3><i><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial">How to use or administer overheating baths, sitz baths,<br>sauna, hot-and-cold shower, Kneipp baths, salt water baths, etc.</font></p></i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Water has been used for remedial purposes since time immemorial. Natives in various parts of the earth, sought the healing effect of natural waters, mineral springs, sea water, rivers and springs. When medical science saw its birth, healing disease with water was recognized as one of the most important therapeutic modalities. Hippocrates, Celus, Galen<b> </b>and other ancient greats of medicine praised water for its many curative properties. In all major ancient civilizations, bathing was held in esteem<b> </b>not only for its remedial properties, but as an important health-building<b> </b>and disease-preventive measure.</font> <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In modern times, the therapeutic properties of water were popularized by Father Kneipp, Maria Schlenz, Priessnitz, and other European water-cure pioneers. There are hundreds of Spas and &quot;Bads&quot; in most European countries where therapeutic baths are used as a major healing measure, especially so-called Kneipp-baths. As Father Kneipp said, &quot;Water contains great healing power&quot; - and millions of yearly visitors to these &quot;bads&quot; can testify that water, indeed, does possess great therapeutic value.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Here are some therapeutic baths that can be employed in healing the sick and in preventing disease. Some of these, like overheating baths, should be supervised by a doctor or nurse, but most can be employed in a do-it-yourself manner in your own home.</font></p><p align="center"><font FACE="    Arial"><b>OVERHEATING THERAPY</b> </font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial">&quot;Give me a chance to create fever and I will cure any disease,&quot; said the great physician, Parmenides, 2,000 years ago.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Fever is one of the body's own defensive and healing forces, created and sustained for the deliberate purpose of restoring health. The high temperature speeds up metabolism, inhibits the growth of the invading virus or bacteria, and literally burns the enemy with heat. Fever is an effective protective and healing measure not only against colds and simple infections, but against such serious diseases as polio and <b>cancer.</b> In biological clinics, overheating therapies or artificially induced fever are used effectively in the treatment of acute infectious diseases, arthritis and rheumatic diseases, skin disorders, insomnia, muscular pain and <b>cancer</b>, to name a few conditions. Such giants of medical science as Nobel Prize Winner, Dr. A. Lwoff, Dr. Werner Zabel, and Dr. Josef Issels, recommend and use fever therapies extensively. Recently, a research team under the direction of Dr. David S. Muchles, from Oxford University, reported that the studies confirmed what ancient physicians and biological doctors knew all along - that fever is effective in combating many diseases, <b>including cancer</b>.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">There are many ways to induce fever. Some doctors use certain vaccines (like BCG) or drugs to create artificial fever. Personally, I prefer a more natural approach. Although fever induced with BCG or drugs can have a beneficial effect by &quot;waking up&quot; and stimulating the body's natural defensive and immunological mechanism, there is less stress on the body if fever is induced with an overheating bath. Schlenz-bath has been used for this purpose for nearly a century.</font></p><a name = "SchlenzBath"></a><p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>SCHLENZ-BATH</b></font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Here's how the curative Schlenz-bath is administered. First, the patient should not eat for at least two hours before treatment. If possible, the bladder and the colon should be emptied. The bath tub should be as large and as deep as possible. If a regular American bath tub is used, you may need to plug the emergency outlet to raise the water to the top of the tub.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The patient must be <i>totally covered with water, </i>including his head; only his nose, eyes and mouth - and as little as possible of them should be left uncovered. Start with a low temperature of about 95 degrees, or about the temperature of the skin. Let warm water run slowly from the faucet and stir constantly. In 15 to 20 minutes, bring the temperature in the tub to about 100 degrees; later to about 103 or even slightly higher, depending on the patient's reaction.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The length of the treatment is about one hour. Although the temperature of the water is not too high, when the patient is totally covered by the water there is no heat escaping from the body and its temperature will invariably rise to match the temperature of the water.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The Schlenz-bath, if given to sick patients, must be supervised. The pulse should not go over 130 or 140. The temperature of the water should be monitored at all times with a bath thermometer. If the patient feels any discomfort, he should be raised out of the water to a sitting position for a while. It is also recommended that the nurse massage the patient with a bristle brush during the bath. This brings the blood to the surface of the skin and relieves the heart from undue pressure.</font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>SAUNA</b></font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">A sauna, or Finnish steam bath, is another excellent way to benefit from overheating therapy. In addition to an artificially induced fever, which a prolonged steam bath always accomplishes, the sauna bath is specifically conducive to profuse therapeutic sweating.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The skin is our largest eliminative organ - &quot;the third kidney.&quot; It is generally considered that the skin should eliminate 30 percent of the body wastes by way of perspiration. Due to lack of physical work and an overly sedentary life, the skin of most people today has degenerated as an eliminative organ, since it is hardly ever subjected to sweating. If health is to be restored, it is of vital importance that the eliminative activity of the skin is revitalized. Taking sauna or steam baths regularly, once or twice a week, will help to restore and revitalize the cleansing activity of the skin.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The therapeutic property of the sauna is attributed to the following facts:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial">Overheating stimulates and speeds up the metabolic processes and inhibits the growth of virus and bacteria.</font></li><li><font face="Arial">All the vital organs and glands are stimulated to increased activity.</font></li><li><font face="Arial">The body's healing forces are aided and assisted, and healing is accelerated.</font></li><li><font face="Arial">The eliminative, detoxifying and cleansing capacity of the skin is dramatically increased by the profuse sweating.</font></li></ul><p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>DO-IT-YOURSELF SAUNA</b></font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">If you do not have your own sauna, and have no easy access to a sauna, you can make a do-it-yourself sauna in your own bedroom, as follows:</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">First take a hot bath, as hot as you can stand. Then dry yourself and wrap in a heavy bath towel. Put a plastic or rubber sheet on your bed to protect it from damage by perspiration. Lie on the rubber sheet, take a couple of hotwater bottles and<b> </b>cover yourself with an electric blanket, turned on high, leaving just a crack for breathing. Use several heavy blankets, if necessary. Remain in bed while profuse sweating occurs half an hour or more. Finish with a shower.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">NOTE: Although fever is a natural, constructive, beneficial symptom, and fever therapy is one of the most effective means in the arsenal of biological modalities, I must stress the fact that fever therapy should always be supervised by an expert practitioner and undertaken on the advice of a doctor. The patient's heart condition, his ability to perspire and his general vitality should be checked and his reaction during the therapy closely supervised. Also, the length of the overheating therapy, and the dosage of fever-inducing drugs (if they are used), should be determined by the doctor.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The above warning is in regard to patients who are ill. There is, of course, no danger for <i>healthy </i>people to take sauna or other steam or hot baths, or even a Schlenz-bath, on a regular basis as a preventive, cleansing and health-building measure, as millions of people are doing both here and in Europe.</font></p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial">End of quotes from writings of Paavo Airola, Ph.D., N.D.

	two kinds of heat - convection heat and radiant heat. Convection heat uses a 
	medium such as air to carry warmth from the heat source to your body. 
	Radiant heat uses a frequency of light that resonates with water molecules. 
	This frequency of light is called &quot;far infrared&quot;. Far infrared heat is safe, 
	being the same kind of heat that warms you in sunlight or in front of a 
	fire. If you have ever held your hand over a flashlight, you will know that 
	light penetrates the body. Unlike convection heat which just warms the skin, 
	far infrared penetrates several centimeters below the surface of the body. 
	Due to this deep heating effect, a far infrared sauna produces much more 
	sweat.</font></p>
