Researchers in four Scandinavian countries found no increase in brain tumor diagnoses from 1998 to 2003, when cellphone use in those countries grew sharply, according to a study published online Thursday in the  Journal of the National Cancer Institute .  That's consistent with most other studies, including a U.S. study that examined brain tumor rates from 1987 to 2005. The International Agency for Research on Cancer also has been conducting a long-term, multinational study, the results of which are expected to be released in a few months. CANCER FORUM:   Share your stories, concerns   Some people have worried about cellphones because they emit radio waves, a form of non-ionizing, low-frequency radiation. This kind of radiation is too weak to damage DNA, however, and scientists know of no biological processes by which radio waves might cause brain cancer, says the  American Cancer Society 's Michael Thun.   Other types of radiation, such as that produced by an atomic bomb, are known to cause cancer, Thun says. Researchers in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, who looked at rates of brain tumors called gliomas and meningiomas dating to 1973, acknowledge their study has limitations. It's possible that their study population of 16 million adults was too small to detect a very slight increased risk, especially if brain tumors are developing in particular subgroups, according to the study.  And it's also possible that brain tumors take more than five to 10 years to develop, says Melissa Bondy of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.  Bondy notes that there are major hurdles to studying links between cellphones and cancer. Even if the study had found an increase in brain tumor rates, that doesn't mean that cellphones are to blame. Studies such as this can find relationships, but they can't prove that one thing caused another. Lots of other trends that can also help explain changes in disease rates. People who remain concerned about cellphones can almost completely eliminate their exposure to these radio waves by using headphones, speaker phones or Bluetooth headsets, Bondy says. "Let's be precautionary, especially in children, because their brains are still developing," Bondy says.
