Kiko received a bulletproof vest from a nonprofit group spearheaded by an NAU student. (Josh Biggs/Arizona Daily Sun)      Loading…               Michael Valdez remembered being a third-grade student in Tucson and hearing about a police dog named Dax that had been shot and killed in the line of duty. He remembered his teacher issuing a challenge to his class: Who would call the Tucson Police Department and ask whether it would accept a donated bulletproof vest for other police dogs? Valdez, now a 19-year-old student at Northern Arizona University, raised his hand that day. And 167 canine bulletproof vests later, his organization, Project Police K-9, has added another vest to the list. On Friday, Valdez presented a bulletproof vest to Kiko, a police dog with the Coconino County Sheriff's Office. More than 30 people attended the ceremony at the Law Enforcement Administrative Facility to watch Kiko give demonstrations of his skills while in his new vest. "This could mean saving their lives," Valdez said of his effort to help equip police dogs with the vests. Sgt. Gerrit Boeck, who leads the sheriff's office K-9 unit, said, "The dogs are doing the same job as we are. So, it makes sense for them to have vests, too." TOO RISKY FOR HUMANS  Often, police dogs are called on to perform actions considered too dangerous for a human officer, Valdez added. In chasing down a suspect, they face the prospect of being shot or stabbed. The vest, which fits over Kiko's shoulders and covers his back, sides and chest, is able to withstand 30 different types of bullets, Valdez said. The vest, unlike many worn by humans, also is able to stop knives and even ice picks from penetrating. Price tag: $825. Kiko's partner, Deputy Rick Shouse, an 11-year veteran with the sheriff's office, said of the vest, "It means protection for a very valuable part of me as a team." He added that in his assignment in the remote Blue Ridge area of the county, backup can be miles away when he needs it. But, with Kiko, he's got a partner seconds away. In his career, Shouse said he's trained with dogs in the military and the Department of Corrections. "This is probably one of the best dogs I've ever had," he said, giving Kiko a strong tousle to his neck. "He makes such a huge difference." HIGHER COST NO BARRIER  Valdez said his work to outfit police dogs in Arizona with bulletproof vests began with a school fundraiser, car washes and coupon books. Vests were $400 when he was in third grade. Although the effort has grown into a nonprofit organization and the vests have become more expensive, Valdez hasn't slowed in his passion to protect police dogs. Valdez said he is already working on raising donations to get a vest for the other sheriff's office police dog, Viktor.
