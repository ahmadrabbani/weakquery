Modern  training methods ha­ve led to dogs becoming an integral part of many pe­ople's lives, not just as companions, but also as  guide dogs , search-and-rescue dogs, and bomb- or  drug -sniffing dogs. But few dogs are asked to give as much of themselves as police dogs. ­Today, police forces in most major cities use police dogs to track criminals, sniff out illegal materials, search buildings, and do other jobs human police officers can't do as well as a dog can. Not only are there thousands of police dogs on the job on any given day, but there are also hundreds of police dogs who have given their lives to protect and serve. In this article, we'll find out how a dog becomes a police dog and what a typical day in the life of a police dog is like. We'll also check out some stories about police dogs in action. ­ Thanks!

We are living through a technological revolution in crime that outpaces our ability to keep current in intelligence or to keep up on the street. Gangs, drugs, advanced communications, rapid air and ground mobility across both state and international borders – it is impossible to field enough police officers. At the most basic level offenders know when there is no police dog on duty in their neighborhood. That is when they run. That is when they go to ground with the officer. That is when they challenge officers with weapons. The Friendly Force – the police dog – protects handlers and covers officers. Most officer murders occur at night. Officers are attacked suddenly, often before they realize the suspect is present or observing them. Fifty percent are ambushes. Where officers are weak, the dog is strong. At night the K-9 sees clearly. His senses alert him to the armed suspect nobody realizes is there. In dangerous searches, foot pursuits, assaults, and fights, the dog gives officers the edge, apprehending suspects quickly and safely. $56.20        Dogs for Police Service Programming and Training  Pages: 100, Hardcover, Charles C Thomas Pub Ltd $28.95        Police and Military Dogs: Criminal Detection, Forensic Evidence, and Judicial Admissibility  Police procedures, forensic science, and the law have all had to take into account the tasks that police dogs perform and the evidence that their work produces. As such, it is essential that those in the criminal justice system understand this type of evidence and its value. Police and Military Dogs: Criminal Detection, Forensic Evidence, and Judicial Admissibility examines the use of police and military dogs for a wide variety of functions and explores canine biology and behavior as it applies to police work. The book begins with an overview of the changes that have occurred in the field in the past four decades as discoveries have been made about canine capabilities. The author examines how a canine handler’s work with a skilled police dog can affect the subsequent investigation and prosecution of the crime. He discusses optimal procedures for finding and processing evidence, and describes the boundaries of admissibility of evidence produced by police dogs. The book examines the many diverse detection functions police dogs are being trained to perform, ranging from cadaver detection to the discovery of explosives. It also describes the use of dogs to apprehend criminals and in search and rescue operations. Written for a wide audience including canine handlers, forensic scientists, attorneys, and the judiciary, this volume covers topics pertinent to all aspects of the police dog in contemporary law enforcement. $69.09             HOWSTUFFWORKS Adventure  Auto  Culture  Entertainment  Health  Home & Garden  Lifestyle  Money  Science  Tech     MORE STUFF Blogs  Games  HSW Tools  RSS  Maps  Podcasts  Quizzes  Newsletters  Video     OUR WEBSITES Animal Planet  Consumer Guide Auto  Consumer Guide Products  Discovery Channel  Discovery Fit & Health  HSW Brazil  HSW China    Investigation Discovery  Oprah Winfrey Network  Planet Green  Science Channel  TLC  Discovery Education  Store     CUSTOMER SERVICE Advertising  Contact Us  Help   CORPORATE About Us  Careers @ Discovery  Privacy Policy  Visitor Agreement     TAKE US WITH YOU       FOLLOW US             © 1998-2011 HowStuffWorks, Inc
