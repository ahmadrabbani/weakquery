The survey focused on consumer attitudes and behaviors about online shopping. A survey was completed by 2,000 U.S. consumers (1,000 via telephone and 1,000 online) to determine their attitudes and behaviors about shopping online and to uncover the specific nature of consumer fears related to online shopping. A total annual financial loss due to consumer online shopping fears was estimated based on the results of this study. Key Insights 1. Nearly 9 percent in Online Sales are Lost Annually Due to Consumers’ Security Concerns Roughly $21 billion in online sales revenue is lost annually because victims of identity theft have stopped shopping online (12 percent) or because consumers do not believe the Internet is safe enough for online shopping (13 percent).  2. Most Consumers Would Blame Merchants for Identity Theft Sixty percent of consumers would blame the online merchant if the consumer were a victim of identity fraud as a result of shopping online.  3. Secure Web Site Logos Indicate Trustworthiness of Web Site Eighty-six percent of consumers stated they look for a secure Web site logo, such as VeriSign or TRUSTe, to determine whether a Web site is trustworthy.  4. Consumers Need Security Assurances from Merchants Eighty-three percent of consumers indicated that online merchants’ assurance of secure processing of payment and personal information would be the most motivating factor for shopping online in the future.  5. Fraud Victims Would First Seek Assistance from Payment Providers Nearly half (47 percent) of consumers stated they would seek assistance first from their payment provider (e.g., bank or credit card company) if they were a victim of identity fraud.
