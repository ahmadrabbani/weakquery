Fr Michael Canny offered to meet the paramilitary group after it pledged to “execute” police officers irrespective of their religion.  In a statement issued yesterday, a source close to the dissident republican movement said it was rejecting Fr Canny's overtures for unconditional talks.  He said: “While Fr Canny said he did not wish to engage in airwave diplomacy, we find that impossible to equate with Fr Canny's media comments that the dissident republican movement has no room in which to manoeuvre and that the actions of dissident republicans were those of evil men.  “Because of these pre-conceived beliefs expressed by Fr Canny in the public domain, we do not feel there would be any merit in meeting with him.”          Print  Email  Text Size  Normal  Large  Extra Large       Also in this section MLA: Don't be eejits over education  Drink 'a factor in 44% of arrests'  Comrade describes soldier's killing  Massereene comrade describes soldier's murder  �60m redundancy deal for jail staff             Most viewed Northern Ireland News Read  Emailed   Read In Pictures: Ladies Day Down Royal  Northern Ireland's top photographers honoured at PPANI awards  Massereene comrade describes soldier's murder  Minister's claims on Finucane case spark fury among nationalist politicians in Assembly  Boy (14) accused of series of sex attacks  Real IRA killers made sure troops Massereene were dead, court told   Ex-principal in fraud probe   Call for review of gay blood ban  Man (18) held on child sex charges   £60m redundancy deal for jail staff    Emailed £60m redundancy deal for jail staff    Commented   Video      Click here...
