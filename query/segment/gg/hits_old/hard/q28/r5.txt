Party leaders gathering at the secluded Weston Park talks venue in Staffordshire said no progress had been made during eight hours of discussions yesterday. The main stumbling blocks remained resolving the issues of arms decommissioning, police reform and British military presence in Ulster. Arriving at the country house this morning, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said Sinn Fein had shown no sign it was ready definitively to commit itself to democratic methods. The British and Irish governments and the nationalist SDLP united yesterday in putting pressure on Sinn Fein to choose between "the Armalite and the ballot box," he said. But Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams - who said he had been in touch with both the present United States administration and former President Bill Clinton - gave no indication that his party was ready to move. Mr Adams said: "A process like this requires resilience and tenacity and patience and determination and commitment to the process. Sinn Fein has that and Mr Trimble knows that. "What we were trying to establish ... is evidence that the British Government understands the imperative of the Good Friday Agreement, that is the template for resolving all these outstanding and contentious issues. "When we left last night, there was no evidence that that was the case." Mr Trimble said that the Weston Park discussions marked the "moment of truth" for republicans. But he added: "Sadly yesterday we didn't see any indication that the republicans were prepared to rise to the occasion. "But what we did see and what I was glad to see was the clear unity of purpose that exists between ourselves, the British Government, the Irish government and the SDLP and the clear pressure that was coming from all four parties on the republicans for them to act on this. "It is still possible for them to do so. We have all of today for this. But they can't keep temporising - they have to act and that moment of truth can't be avoided." Mr Trimble, whose resignation as First Minister sparked the latest rounds of discussions, held out the possibility of a return to Weston Park to resume talks on Friday if no conclusion was reached today. But Tony Blair and Irish premier Bertie Ahern are understood to be ready to keep the parties talking into the early hours of tomorrow morning to reach some kind resolution before the climax of the Ulster marching season on July 12. Mr Ahern was absent for this morning's discussions, as he is attending a court hearing in Dublin. He is expected back at Weston Park early this afternoon. Meanwhile, Progressive Unionist Party MLA David Ervine said he would be briefing his party executive later today to "withdraw from this current phase of the process" because the talks were going nowhere. But the leading loyalist stressed his party, which is linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force, remained committed to the Good Friday Agreement. He said: "This is not some fit of pique from my party. "We are advocating withdrawal from this phase of the process because at the round table session yesterday Sinn Fein would not give us an answer to what it meant by the 'causes of conflict' in 2001. "That is a perfectly legitimate question but Gerry Adams was singularly refusing to answer it and until we get that question answered, we have no way of knowing where republicans are coming from and what is possible. "Now let me stress we in the PUP remained committed to dialogue. We believe a negotiated process is the only way forward. "We remain fully committed to the Good Friday Agreement. We are not advocating any change of position on ceasefire - the issue of ceasefire doesn't even enter into it." Mr Ervine accused republicans of adding to their shopping list of demands to the British Government yesterday but refusing to reveal their position. "It's a bit like someone selling a car but refusing to tell you what price he's selling it at," the PUP Assemblyman said. "It was clear from yesterday this process is badly structured. What's the point in having a process where no one knows about what the bottom lines of the other parties are?" Sources in the smaller pro-Agreement parties were downbeat today about the prospects of a breakthrough in the talks. One participant said parties at yesterday's opening round table discussion "restated positions". The source said: "There was a lot of tough talking. David Trimble told Gerry Adams republicans were going to have to take responsibility for arms. "David Ervine and Adams had an exchange about the causes of conflict. (SDLP deputy leader) Seamus Mallon was critical of republicans and also the British Government's handling of the process. "Adams was very heavy on the type of language that was being used, about people saying republicans were donkeys who had had too many carrots and too few sticks, about unionists saying Sinn Fein needed to be house-trained. "The Prime Minister was insistent yesterday the deal is do-able if people decided they want to do it. There was no sense the Government is considering at this stage suspending the Assembly or holding elections, he seemed very focused on getting a deal. "There is possibility that we might return to Weston Park if a deal is on and I would suggest if you see us heading back there, that's white smoke. "However, it is really down to the three parties remaining in there (the Ulster Unionists, SDLP and Sinn Fein)." The source saw the issue of police reforms as a potential stumbling block. "With Adams demanding the implementation of the Patten Report plus a ban on plastic bullets, the SDLP demanding Patten and Trimble warning unionists would not accept Patten because it is against the spirit of the Agreement, I think that could be the most difficult circle to square for the Government."     Print this article   Read later   Email to a friend   Share this article:   Facebook    Twitter    Digg it    Newsvine    Delicious    MySpace    Nowpublic    Reddit             We are no longer accepting comments on this article.
