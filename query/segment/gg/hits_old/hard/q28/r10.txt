Peter Wilson, director of the Asia Pacific Directorate of the UK Foreign Office, compared the Malaysian-brokered peace talks to the tough peace process that successfully ended in a peace deal in Northern Ireland, saying conflicts, despite its complexities, can be resolved. �The Northern Ireland peace talks taught us that problems that have in the past that look almost intractable are soluble,� Wilson, who is Manila for bilateral consultations, told a press conference. �It was very much that feeling that I had in our in depth discussions today that the Philippine government is approaching this talks in a very, very positive way and that gives us great course of confidence that a progress can be made.� The new faction led by Ameril Umbra Kato has set concerns about the future of the years-long negotiations between the Philippine government and the MILF. Months ago, Kato has formed his own group and took 1,000 fighters under his wing, but said he remains affiliated with the larger Muslim group.  Videos of Kato have circulated in which he announced that he has formed a new armed group to continue the struggle for an independent Islamic state in the southern Philippines. Amid obstacles, Wilson said he sees the peace process �moving to the right direction� with �optimism.� The signing of the so-called 1998 Good Friday Agreement marked the unofficial end to the conflict in Northern Ireland, wherein a low intensity civil war took the lives of more than 3,000 people. The MILF, which used to be part of a larger secessionist group, has been combating government troops in the Southern Philippines since 1969, in one of Asia �s longest-running insurgencies. A final peace agreement between the two sides is expected to end more than 40 years of Muslim rebellion in Southern Philippines that has claimed at least 120,000 lives, brought massive destruction to property, and crippled the region�s economy.  Western nations have urged for a final settlement in the decades-old conflict in Mindanao to usher in more investments in the region�s ailing economy, transform it as a tourism hub and provide jobs. A major player in the Mindanao peace process, the UK is a member of the International Contact Group (ICG), a group of countries and foreign non-government organizations acting as an advisory body and guarantors to the peace process. Apart from the UK, its other members are Turkey, Japan, Saudi Arabia, non-state members like the Washington-based Asia Foundation, Center for Humanitarian Dialogue of Geneva, Muhammadiyah of Jakarta, and Conciliation Resources of London.                |  More       .NATION.
