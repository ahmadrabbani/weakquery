The surprise resignation by the seasoned diplomat comes only days ahead of President Barack Obama's highly anticipated speech on the pro-democracy uprisings sweeping Arab nations on Thursday. ''The fact that this is a hard issue, an extraordinarily hard issue, is not news to anyone … who's ever attempted to work on it over these many years,'' White House spokesman Jay Carney said of peace attempts in the Middle East.

Mr Obama tapped Mr Mitchell as Middle East envoy at the start of his new administration in 2009, hoping the former US senator could bring his renowned negotiating skills to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Mr Mitchell (pictured) who managed against all odds to broker the historic Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland in 1998, ending decades of bitter conflict, has been indefatigable in his efforts in the Middle East. But despite numerous trips and closed-door talks, Israel and the Palestinians are no closer to achieving a peace accord, which the US hopes to result in two nations living side-by-side. Washington's last bid to relaunch direct peace talks in September 2010 failed less than a month later, when Israel refused to extend a moratorium on settlement building in the West Bank.
