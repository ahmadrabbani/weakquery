But U.S. commanders are not allowed to comment publicly and it�s unclear to them what the U.S. strategy is for dealing with Iran�s increasingly deadly involvement.  The deadliest form of roadside bomb on the Iraqi battlefield - explosively formed penetrators (EFPs) - is now being found in Afghanistan.  Lethal armor piercing bombs that can slice through U.S. humvees are also an Iranian specialty.  More worrying still: U.S. intelligence believes Iran is supplying surface to air missiles to the Taliban - the very same weapon the U.S. supplied to the Afghan resistance to bring down the Russians. Just like with Iraq, the left denied Iranian involvement in supplying weapons and training to Shia AND Sunni (weapons) insurgents. They are playing the same game with EFPs in Afghanistan and it appears the Obama Administration does not want to talk about it. They want to talk to Iran instead.  2495 10-08-2009, 05:36 PM  I think the talking will be done when the MOP fits into the B-2B fleet. Iran needs an attitude adjustment of the highest and finest calibre, and soon. The 'left' just needs a decent :bash::slap::backhand: and yes I am aware that the USA played this game when the Soviets were in Afghanistan, but lets face it, when faced off against the Soviets the west really did face up to the 'evil empire' that fought proxy wars against freedom and the west for many decades till it quite frankly - lost.  dracon49 10-08-2009, 05:41 PM  The US needs send them few Tomahawks on the IRGC bases. Even now that they are in Iraq and Afganistan they can bomb the hell of Iran with ships and planes and also according to a poll that was published yesterday i think 61% of the Americans support attacking Iran.

X2, what a slap in the face and a kick in the @$$, someone needs to knock them down a few steps.  JCR 10-08-2009, 06:38 PM  Yeah, the usual leftie commies among you... Sorry, but the usage of EFPs is no indication of iranians. Every trained engineer officer knows how to make an EFP. Maybe some recent graduates of the ANA engineer school have a secondary job now? And didn't US intelligence once believe Iraq had WMDs? I would be more worried if US intelligence cathegorically stated the Talibs have no MANPADs at all...:)  I can't think of a name 10-08-2009, 06:46 PM  Yeah, the usual leftie commies among you...

So you are predisposed to apologize or deny that they are involved even though now it has been proven that Iran was supplying the deadliest IED/EFPs to Iraqi insurgents.  Yet in 2006 there were plenty of people like you calling people who pointed out Iran's involvement as right wing nuts, and that the US was wrong on Iraq WMDs.  Henry's Fork 10-08-2009, 06:51 PM  And didn't US intelligence once believe Iraq had WMDs? And quite a few other countries, intel agencies as well................ Whats your point?  JCR 10-08-2009, 06:52 PM  I don't like Iran either, just the fact that the Talibs use a technique of demolition that is well known all over the world does not prove anything. I'm not saying Iran isn't involved because I like Iran, but because there are ideological and religious differences as well as real world issues (drugs mostly) that stand between such a cooperation, even against a common enemy.  Skutatos 10-08-2009, 06:53 PM  Our best bet is to help destabilize Iran. An attack would probably have the opposite effect. There is alot of young people in Iran who aren't too fond of their government right now. If we can get the government overthrown there without direct intervention it is far less costly to everyone and far more beneficial as well. We are running out of time though.  crush6655 10-08-2009, 07:33 PM  Our best bet is to help destabilize Iran. An attack would probably have the opposite effect.

Did you ear the news from Iran ? The first execution of an Iranian protester (Cause of the elections). Good luck to Iran with it's Islamic "Democracy" :cantbeli:  Spezz 10-08-2009, 07:54 PM  and yes I am aware that the USA played this game when the Soviets were in Afghanistan, but lets face it, when faced off against the Soviets the west really did face up to the 'evil empire' that fought proxy wars against freedom and the west for many decades till it quite frankly - lost. hahahaa, you can't really believe what you are saying? USA fought proxy wars fro the same reason the SU did, to gain influence in the world. Freedom and being the "evil empire" (can't believe you used that term, you child) had nothing to do with it. And definitely not in the case of Afghanistan.  GazB 10-08-2009, 10:55 PM  You are coming here and posting not wanting to give merit to the fact taht Iran is a bad actor. So you are predisposed to apologize or deny that they are involved even though now it has been proven that Iran was supplying the deadliest IED/EFPs to Iraqi insurgents. No Ronald Reagan was a bad actor. Iran is a country in the middle of two American made wars. They don't love America but there is no evidence they have actually done anything to make life hard for the US so far. If they really wanted the US out they could simply buy 1,000 MANPADs and 1,000 TOW knockoffs direct from China and then deliver them into both Iraq and Afghanistan just like the US did to the Soviets. The ATGMs is less publicised but the Muj had Milans, I have footage on video tape from a CNN report. Of course the CNN reporter describes the muj firing Milan ATGMs at the T-54 tanks as firing artillery and they don't actually manage to get a hit with the weapon. (hahahaha), but they use numbers and terrain and overrun the position eventually. Where is this unequivicol evidence that fighters in both regions needed Iranian equipment to learn to kill tanks with shaped charges? I would think US and British special forces must be pretty crap if they hadn't taught them in the 1980s against the Soviets. I would suggest that the initial failures and later successes you are desperate to prove is evidence of Iranian interference is more likely trial and error. The bombs they used to kill the old Soviet tanks the Soviets sent to Afghanistan didn't work on the western tank. Solution make the bombs bigger. All of a sudden they start working... must be Iran... Yet in 2006 there were plenty of people like you calling people who pointed out Iran's involvement as right wing nuts, and that the US was wrong on Iraq WMDs. Some Iranians being involved is possible. Official Iranian influence is as yet unproven. And Iraq had no WMDs. They just didn't exist. The only evidence I have read about since the US invasion were rounds left over from WWI that were buried and mobile chem systems that had never been used. And quite a few other countries, intel agencies as well................ Whats your point? The fact that they were sure that Iraq had lots of WMDs weaponised and within 45 minutes of actually being used, that were a threat to the entire world. The fact that they were wrong. Our best bet is to help destabilize Iran. Yeah, imposing a dictator on them made the US really popular last time, I am sure putting them through that again will make them think they should do exactly as they are told when they are told. Or it might make them think America is never going to leave them alone so they might have to actually do something about it. and yes I am aware that the USA played this game when the Soviets were in Afghanistan, but lets face it, when faced off against the Soviets the west really did face up to the 'evil empire' that fought proxy wars against freedom and the west for many decades till it quite frankly - lost. Sorry, but you have a bit of a cheek suggesting it was done for freedom and democracy. Look at what the US did. If it really was interested in freedom and democracy then the goal should have been democracy for the 1.5 billion Chinese, not the 400 odd million Soviets. It is amusing you think the US won when Communist China is still in operation. If the cold war was about democracy then the CIA never would have put the Shah of Iran in power and the people of Iran wouldn't have so many bad feelings about the west in general and the US in particular.  camerashy 10-09-2009, 02:10 AM  Iran is a country in the middle of two American made wars.  While I disagree with the US' reason for going into Iraq (WMDs) I know very well what Saddam Hussein did to the Kurds and thats all the reason for me to support that endeavor.

Major ideological differences and not to forget the animosity of the Taliban and Shia(Hazaras) inside Afghanistan and the Shia in Pakistan that Iranians cannot turn a blind eye on. Iranian at the end of the day are not that stupid to start supporting the Taliban. There are other troops in Afghanistan and they are not all US. It would bring Iranians in a very bad diplomatic relationships with other NATO countries, EU and UN. Any corporation with the Taliban with give automatically the green light for fresh strict sanctions and even military actions. Not to mention that it's close partners in arms deals Russia will have to cut ties from the diplomatic pressure. Israel will be more than happy if these accusations are true and so Arab countries that see Iran as a threat to their interests.  I am still not convinced that Iranian government supported directly or indirectly Shias in Iraq. Few Iranian Rpg launchers and rockets does not prove anything. AKs and RPGs are available in all black markets in the region. If they wanted to cause havoc in Iraq they could have done it. In an interview that was posted in this forum the Taliban also showed some Iranian made weapons among other. The only group that receives Iranian government support is Hezbollah. They have the latest high-tech Iranian weapons. Until the Taliban start showing the same high tech weapons I don't see a reason to accuse them. These accusations about Iran and Taliban is connected with the ongoing Iranian nuclear program that some want to see it terminated (included me).

As I remember Northern Alliance get Iranian support to fight Talibans. Those weapons can now be used by Hekmatiar boys or other parts of Northern alliance that are allied to Taliban now...  Al-Bundy 10-09-2009, 05:14 AM  As I remember Northern Alliance get Iranian support to fight Talibans. Those weapons can now be used by Hekmatiar boys or other parts of Northern alliance that are allied to Taliban now... Yes(also the Russians were supporting them) and Yes (expected and unfortunate).  GazB 10-12-2009, 05:20 AM  While I disagree with the US' reason for going into Iraq (WMDs) I know very well what Saddam Hussein did to the Kurds and thats all the reason for me to support that endeavor. But F@CK YOU you cockroach for suggesting America started the war in Afghanistan.So you are saying the Taleban started the war by what? Refusing to hand over a person on their territory despite noextradition rights negotiated between the two countries. I would suggest a cockroach has a better understanding of international law. The US gave an ultimation to the Taleban government of Afghanistan and when that ultimatim was ignored the US invaded. The US clearly started it. These accusations about Iran and Taliban is connected with the ongoing Iranian nuclear program that some want to see it terminated (included me).Sounds to me like the claims that the Iranians support the taleban and insurgents in Iraq are a bit like US government claims that Saddam was supporting Al Quada before the invasion. Of course rabid supporters of the US government on another forum I used to visit posted documents they claimed showed clear evidence of a link between Saddam and Al Quada. Of course after reading the documents in question it was clear that as per usual Al Quada was an enemy of Saddam and that Al Quada bases in Northern Iraq were only present because of the northern no fly zone prevented Saddam from dealing with them in his usual way. BTW Saddams gassing of the Kurds was portrayed in the west after Saddam had invaded Kuwaite as if he was gassing his own people. At the time it was clear to everyone of course that he was in fact doing what Turkey does to this day with the Kurd seperatists when ever they can... ie kills them. The Kurds want to recreate Kurdistan, but the problem is that Kurdistan if drawn on a map occupies land currently inside the borders of Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. Hense the Kurds in Turkey and Syria and Iran and Iraq are not really Turkish, Syrian, Iranian, or Iraqi, they are seperatists who want their own country. Claiming Iran is supporting those fighting the US in Iraq and Afghanistan is a great way to bring into focus Iran as the bad guy, and take focus away from the problems in Iraq and Afghanistan created by the US invasions. Even if Iran was supporting the rebels as much as they could so what. They are not obliged to support the US in anything. It is not like the US doesn't dabble in the affairs of others. The US has interests... well everyone else does too. Even cockroaches. :roll: BTW interesting post Al Bundy. Nice to see people actually think about things rather than take the press released from the US state department as gospel. Would also like to say best of luck to those in Afghanistan and Iraq trying to rebuild and repair two countries with very long histories.

Which shows how little understanding about Taliban the US had at that time. Looking now at the Afghan situation, it appears clear to me that the Taliban had no power whatsoever to comply with the US demands. It is true, they had some sort of government, but probably didn't control in the country coherent way.

Pashtun tribal code made it impossible to comply with US demands, not much else.  dracon49 10-12-2009, 04:53 PM  Taliban and Iran have the same interests-they are against the US so "the enemey of my enemy is my friend"  Sootan 10-12-2009, 10:40 PM  Taliban and Iran have the same interests-they are against the US so "the enemey of my enemy is my friend" Oh the irony, driving your enemies closer together instead of dividing them.  Backpacker 10-12-2009, 10:45 PM  Taliban and Iran have the same interests-they are against the US so "the enemey of my enemy is my friend" I've said it once, but i'll say it again.  There's no point in Iran supplying the Taliban when there are plenty of other groups in Afghanistan who attack the US just at much and on top of that, aren't at war with Iran.  It's like the US choosing to support Hezbollah in their fight against Al Qaeda elements in Lebabon, sure they've got a common enemy, but it would be better for the US to support the Lebanese Army.  dracon49 10-12-2009, 10:57 PM  Why do you think like that?...if they can add more to the fire why they wouldnt do it?....and btw in the past the US itself supported Taliban if i dont have a mistake against the Soviets.  Backpacker 10-12-2009, 10:59 PM  Why do you think like that?...if they can add more to the fire why they wouldnt do it?....and btw in the past the US itself supported Taliban if i dont have a mistake against the Soviets. Yes, but they can 'add to the fire" by supplying their allies, not someone they've been fighting for the past 20 years. In all honesty, the Taliban have caused more direct damage to their country then the US. Also, while the average Iranian doesn't hate Americans (just their foreign policy), there is a deep seeted hatred of the Taliban because they are genuinely bad people that are screwing up their neighborhood.  Hollis 10-12-2009, 11:01 PM  Why do you think like that?...if they can add more to the fire why they wouldnt do it?....and btw in the past the US itself supported Taliban if i dont have a mistake against the Soviets. Try reading a little more history.  Taliban did not seize power way after the Soviets left Afghanistan.  dracon49 10-12-2009, 11:06 PM  I read that Taliban put their hands on American weapons so it can be weapons from Iran that Iran got in the SHAH time  Backpacker 10-12-2009, 11:19 PM  I read that Taliban put their hands on American weapons so it can be weapons from Iran that Iran got in the SHAH time The Shah fell before the USSR moved into Afghanistan, let alone the Taliban which arose in the early nineties, that being said you could be right about the Pashtun tribes that would become the Taliban. Alsono matter what Hollis says, the US did support the tribes that would become the Taliban, but the actual Taliban themselves, no the US never actively funded and supported them.  There were some pictures floating around here a while back of mortars with Iranian mortars, and everyone was crying out how this was uncontrovertable proof, until then someone read the date and it was from the 1980's/1990's when Iran was backing the Northern Alliance.  dracon49 10-12-2009, 11:30 PM  Also in the Iran-Iraq war the US supported one of the sides(forgot who) ,right?  Backpacker 10-12-2009, 11:51 PM  Also in the Iran-Iraq war the US supported one of the sides(forgot who) ,right? The US supported the Iraqi's. They also gave the Iranians TOW"s, HAWK's and some other small missiles like that, but it was all clandestine, under the table stuff in order to get back US hostages from Lebanon.  dracon49 10-13-2009, 12:00 AM  If i remember well they asked Israel to give some stuff to Iran.  3rdMillhouse 10-13-2009, 12:00 AM  Without commenting on the righteousness of the NATO effort in Afghanistan, I simply must ask: in what way did the United States not start that particular conflict?

Are the mods still handing out "Dumbass of the week" tags to users?  jackehammond 10-13-2009, 03:15 AM  Folks, Iran may be giving support to the Taliban under the leadership of Mullah Omar who in Kandahar put on the cloak of the prophet and claimed the title of "The Commander of the Faithful" and leads a following who considers many Sunnis to be worst than idol worshipers -- ie much less Shias who are considered heretics and dead meat -- but it would be like Jews supporting Hitler. So maybe. Also, read what happened to the Iranian "diplomats" in the last northern Afghan city taken by the Taliban forces before 9/11. Again, it may be true. But highly unlikely. Jack E. Hammond .

So, if I understand this correctly, the United States did not initiate a conflict in Afghanistan because a transnational (and thereby not dependent on any single base of operations) terrorist organization that could not possibly be 'handed over' (HOLLIS, please, a little common sense is not much to ask for) by any state actor attacked it? At best, the occupation of Afghanistan was justified by the salient features of the case. But the Taliban state organism that has been combating NATO forces there over the last eight years certainly did not start the conflict... Allow an analogy: 1) The Black Hand assassinates Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo. 2) The Austro-Hungarian government believes the BH to be located in and supported by Serbia. 3) The AH government issues a series of demands to the Serbian government regarding the BH. 4) The Serbian government cannot agree to one of the demands made. 5) Therefore, Serbia started WWI? I am by no means against NATO operations in Afghanistan, but this sort of self-serving reasoning is disingenuous.  Are the mods still handing out "Dumbass of the week" tags to users? I'm sorry, is this referring to me? If it is, keep your snide remarks to yourself, if you cannot be bothered to put an ounce of substance into them... Instead of asking me to elucidate my point, you jumped to the nearest, dogmatically safest and most comfortable conclusion. That's a reflection of your reasoning skills and intellectual laziness, and not of the valid argument (debatable as it may be) that received your tender attention.  L.

Bytheway: Wasn�t Iran one of the biggest supporters of Northen Coalition before 2001? And ain�t here a small, insignificant ideologistic differences between Iran (Shias) and Taliban (Sunnis) because last time I checked Taliban did not even consider Shia beeing muslims and was kind of slaughtering them.

There are other events leading up the the attacks on the US in 2001. Even Clinton launched a attack on A-stan soil.  http://www.cnn.com/US/9808/20/us.strikes.01/ Maybe you missed that period of time. Somehow commonsense and global politics does not seem to mix.  Also, you might want to review the Taliban's responses to the US to hand over AQ. As far as today's Taliban VS the Ruling Taliban of Afghanistan in 2001....... just review the last 8 years of history. On your response to "could not be possibly handed over"............... As if there was just a simple one step approach. Again, review the Taliban's responses to the US demands on "handing over" AQ. Among the many articles: http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0916-01.htm "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - Under threat of U.S. military strikes, Afghanistan's Taliban rulers said explicitly for the first time Sunday that Osama bin Laden is still in the country and is being kept in a location secret from the outside world.........Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, told CNN that hopes that the Taliban will hand over bin Laden and accede to other U.S. demands are ``very dim.'' Pakistani contacts have not succeeded ``in moderating their views on the surrender of Osama bin Laden,'' he told CNN. " CNN Article in 1998; "In Afghanistan, a spokesman for the ruling Taliban, Mullah Abdullah, said that "bin Laden is safe and no damage has been done to any of his companions." Bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan with the permission of the Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic group that controls most of the country."  Lokos 10-17-2009, 07:12 AM  You said 'hand over Al-Qaeda' (several times), not 'hand over Osama bin Laden'. Since those terms are not synonyms, why bring OBL up in refuting my rebuttal? If you'll please, don't argue the straw man. My position is simple: you cannot 'hand over' an organization that doesn't depend on any one man, geographical base of operations or other singular facet of its structure. I did not mention any individual. And that stands even if we're still assuming that the presentations of the Taliban during the aforementioned period should be taken at face value... I don't know why you would, without a deeper look at the contextual issues. Could they have apprehended him, or a significant portion of AQ's senior cadre? Though the Taliban was an administration of sorts, who is to say they had any more control over Afghanistan's hinterlands than the NATO forces operating there with the new Afghan authority now?  Secondly, AQ attacking the United States still =/= the Taliban starting a conflict with the US. You can say that the United States had a pretext for initiating the conflict, but in doing so keep the language unambiguous. An existing pretext or causus belli isn't the same thing as the other party having 'started the conflict'. If we're talking about the physical conflict (and I believe we are) in Afghanistan now, it began when US forces initiated an offensive effort against the Taliban regime in 2001. I don't see how that's disputable, unless we conflate AQ and the Taliban. Which, to me, seems fairly disingenuous.  Like I said: I don't disagree with the NATO effort in Afghanistan. I just disagree with a fantasy approach to its context. L.  Powered by vBulletin® Version 4.1.7 Copyright © 2011 vBulletin Solutions, Inc. All rights reserved.
