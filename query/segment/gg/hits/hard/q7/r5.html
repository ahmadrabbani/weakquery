<p class="honbun18">Section 4. Cooperation in and Contributions to Various Activities of the  
United Nations</p> 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p class="honbun12">1. Major Events in the United Nations in 1974</p>    
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p class="honbun13">(1) In connection with the structual changes which have confronted the world      
community in the economic and social fields in recent years, the United Nations      
has been taking initiatives in solving problems, and this trend became      
particularly prominent in 1974. For instance, in addition to the annual U.N.      
General Assembly in New York from September, large-scale international      
conferences were held under the auspices of the United Nations such as the Sixth      
Special Session of the General Assembly on Raw Materials and Development in New      
York in April, the Conference on the Law of the Sea in Caracas from June to      
August, the World Population Conference in Bucharest in August and the World      
Food Conference in Rome in November. These conferences reflected the global      
awareness that various problems such as resources, energy, food and population      
required a solution at the global level, and that it was no longer possible to      
cope effectively with them on a bilateral or small-group-of-nations basis. It      
can be said that the role of the United Nations, which is the most universal and      
comprehensive international organization for the settlement of these problems,      
was recognized anew. In addition to the problems handled by the conferences      
mentioned above, the United Nations today handles problems in practically all      
areas of human life, including peace-keeping, disarmament, development      
cooperation, social problems, human rights, science and technology, outer space      
and environment, and has increased its role in promoting effective and      
comprehensive international cooperation.</p>     
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p class="honbun13">(2) The United Nations continued to be active in the field of maintaining         
international peace, the primary role expected of it in its Charter. In settling         
the Fourth Middle East War in October 1973 and the Cyprus dispute which broke         
out again in July 1974, the United Nation's &quot;peace-keeping operation,&quot;         
aimed at preventing the recurrence and expansion of disputes, was actively         
resorted to. This deserves attention as proof that this kind of operation by the         
United Nations can perform the realistic role of complementing the direct         
diplomatic efforts of the parties and countries concerned. It should not be         
overlooked that the mediation by the special envoy of the Secretary General         
concerning the border dispute beween Iran and Iraq was successful. <sup><a href="#* In response to¥¥¥"> *</a></sup> It also         
deserves to be noted that the United Nations at last worked out &quot; a         
definition of aggression , &quot; a task started during the days of the League         
of Nations and on which the United Nations also had spent many years.</p>       
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p class="honbun13">(3) Disarmament is another area where expectations are placed on the role of         
the United Nations. A salient feature of 1974 was that it saw the most active         
debate in recent years at the Conference of the&nbsp; Committee on Disarmament         
in Geneva and at the 29th Session of the General Assembly on nuclear non-proliferation and the creation of nuclear weapon free zones, partly because         
the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of         
Nuclear Weapons was scheduled for May 1975 and also due to the emergence for the         
first time in 10 years of a new nuclear power (India).</p>        
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p class="honbun13">(4) A very noteworthy trend in 1974 was the fact that the developing         
countries, especially the non-aligned countries, increased their voice further         
in the General Assembly. The impression was that the developing countries had         
joined forces with China, the Soviet Union and the East European countries and         
numerically overwhelmed the Western countries on such problems as the adoption         
of the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New         
International Economic Order, at the Sixth Special Session of the General         
Assembly on Raw Materials and Development, the special treatment accorded         
Chairman Yassan Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization at the general         
debate on the Palestine question, limitation of Israel's voice, the resolution         
on the right of self-determination and the resolution giving observer status to         
the PLO, the suspension of South African participation in the U.N. General         
Assembly, the adoption of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States         
and the rejection of Israel as a member of the West European group in UNESCO.         
There was a heated argument toward the close of the General Assembly between the         
developing countries and the United States and some EC countries which opposed         
this trend.</p>        
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p class="honbun13">(5) Many of the new forces mentioned in (4) above are developing countries         
that acquired independence recently. They have become increasingly self-assertive in recent years in their demands for a reorganization of the         
existing order, the basic framework of the international community, as a means         
of reforming the status quo. In 1974, the developing countries, under the         
leadership of those countries whose economic positions improved through the         
energy crisis, strongly demanded a drastic enhancement of their political and         
economic status. The creation of an ad hoc committee to review the U.N. Charter         
by the 29th Session of the General Assembly, in addition to the holding of the         
Conference on the Law of the Sea, the adoption of the Declaration at the Sixth         
Special Session of the General Assembly on Raw Materials and Development and the         
adoption of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States at the General         
Assembly, are proof that their demands are beginning to take concrete form.</p>        
<p>&nbsp;</p>     
<p class="honbun12">2. Japan's Diplomatic Efforts at the United Nations</p>        
<p>&nbsp;</p>     
<p class="honbun13">Japan has consistently         
placed high expectations on the United Nations which aims at the maintenance of         
international peace and cooperation in various fields. One of the pillars of         
Japan's diplomacy has been active participation and cooperation in the various         
activities undertaken by the United Nations to achieve these objectives. From         
this point of view, Japan places particular emphasis on the three areas of         
disarmament, economic and social development, and the strengthening of the         
foundations of the United Nations. Japan's main efforts in 1974 were as follows         
:</p>        
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p class="honbun13">(1) In the field of economic and social development, Japan stressed the need         
for &quot; dialogue and cooperation&quot; at the Sixth Special Session of the         
General Assembly on Raw Materials and Development , and actively cooperated in         
emergency assistance for the developing countries most seriously affected by the         
current economic situation. At the World Food Conference, Japan stressed the         
importance of self-help on the part of the developing countries for expanding         
agricultural production. In the debates on the Charter of Economic Rights and         
Duties of States and other matters, Japan endeavored to have its views         
incorporated while avoiding a showdown with the developing countries, although         
not necessarily with satisfactory results.</p>        
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p class="honbun13">(2) In his general debate speech at the 29th Session of the General Assembly,         
Foreign Minister Kimura made proposals on nuclear non-proliferation and the         
problem of integration and coordination of actions in the economic and social         
fields. These proposals bore fruit in the form of a resolution appealing to all         
states to exert concerted efforts in all the appropriate international forums         
with a view to working out promptly effective measures for nuclear non -proliferation and also in the resolution for strengthening the functions of the         
Economic and Social Council.</p>        
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p class="honbun13">(3) The 29th Session of the General Assembly discussed for the first time in         
two years the subject of reviewing the U.N. Charter, which Japan, from the         
standpoint of strengthening the United Nations, had consistently supported since         
its adoption as an agenda item at the 24th Session of the General Assembly in         
1969. Japan, together with other countries in favor of the review, successfully         
promoted a resolution for the creation of an ad hoc committee for reviewing the         
U.N. Charter.</p>        
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p class="honbun13">(4) Japan co-sponsored and promoted resolutions on the Korean and Cambodian         
questions, the two major issues in the U.N. related to Asia, at the 29th Session         
of the General Assembly, both of which were adopted. On the Korean issue, Japan    
co-sponsored a resolution seeking implementation of the consensus reached at the         
28th Session of the General Assembly in 1973 and expressing the hope that the         
Security Council would give consideration to the dissolution of the United         
Nations Command, in conjunction with appropriate measures for maintaining the         
Armistice Agreement, with the view to promoting dialogue and enhancing many-sided exchange between North and South and for the maintenance of peace and         
security on the Korean Peninsula. On the Cambodian issue, Japan co-sponsored,         
together with other countries of the Asia and Pacific area, a resolution calling         
upon the parties directly concerned in Cambodia to negotiate with each other and         
requesting the Secretary General to use his good offices, from the viewpoint         
that it would be undesirable for the U.N. to change Cambodian representation         
because it would impose a choice upon the Cambodian people and establish an         
unwelcome precedent in U.N. history and that the United Nations should rather         
provide as much assistance as possible for a peaceful settlement of the         
Cambodian problem.</p>        
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p class="honbun13">(5) Japan abstained from voting on such issues as South Africa, Palestine and         
the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. Generally, Japan as a         
developed country often shares the same views with the developed Western         
countries. On the other hand, Japan as an Asian nation has a deep understanding         
of and sympathy for the aspirations of the Asian and African countries. When         
there is a split of opinion between the Asian and African countries and the         
advanced Western countries, Japan makes it a rule to endeavor to find as much as         
possible a point of accommodation so that the two sides can come closer         
together. However, Japan is compelled to make a very difficult choice when such         
efforts fail and an issue is put to a vote. Japan abstained from voting on the         
three issues mentioned above under such difficult circumstances.</p>        
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p class="honbun13">(6) Lastly, Japan has been making efforts to take part in the work of the         
major organs and various committees where substantial debates are conducted,         
from the standpoint of actively participating in the work of the United Nations         
by taking every opportunity possible. Such efforts produced remarkable results         
at the 29th Session of the General Assembly. First, Japan successfully ran for         
the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council, which can be regarded         
as the two wheels of the United Nations. It was also elected a member of the         
Industrial Development Board of the United Nations Industrial Development         
Organization, the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Program         
and the World Food Council. Furthermore, it succeeded in having Japanese members         
seated on the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,         
which plays an important role in controlling the administration and finances of         
the United Nations, and also the International Civil Service Commission. That         
Japan was elected to all these important posts indicates the rise in the esteem         
in which Japan is held by other countries and also the expansion of its         
responsibilities.</p>

response to a request by Iraq for U.N. Security Council deliberation on a border         
incursion by Iran, the Security Council in February unanimously called on the         
Secretary General to dispatch a special envoy to investigate the Iran-Iraq         
border dispute. In May, both Iran and Iraq agreed, through the special envoy, on         
a four-point measure to improve the situation, and the Security Council adopted         
a resolution welcoming the agreement.</a></p>
