			Two more innocent men have been freed from death row.</span></strong></a> 
			Just last week, Yancy Douglas and Paris Powell became the 137th and 
			138th people to be exonerated from death row. The two men were 
			convicted of a drive-by shooting in 1993 based on the testimony of 
			an in-custody informant who had been offered leniency from the 
			prosecution. The prosecutors at trial withheld information about 
			this plea-deal from the defense, which resulted in a new trial. All 
			charges against the two men have now been dropped because of the 
			unreliability of the in-custody informant’s testimony, the only 
			evidence that linked Douglas and Powell to the crime.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
			<br />
			These exonerations highlight the power prosecutors have in securing 
			convictions by utilizing in-custody informant testimony, even when 
			no physical evidence links a defendant to the crime. Testimony by 
			in-custody informants or “jailhouse snitches” as they are often 
			referred, is a leading cause of wrongful convictions. With little to 
			lose, jailhouse snitches have great incentives to provide false 
			information to prosecutors in exchange for leniency or other forms 
			of compensation. Deals that are made between prosecutors and 
			jailhouse snitches do not often come to light when a jury has to 
			weigh the evidence is a case.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
			<br />
			<span id="more-681"></span>The exonerations of Douglas and Powell 
			demonstrate, yet again, the very real threat of false testimony and 
			the strong need for corroborating evidence to ensure that accurate 
			and credible testimony is presented to juries in criminal trials. 
			The fairness and accuracy of our justice system is at stake when 
			jurisdictions do not require mandatory, pre-trial disclosures of all 
			incentives given to in-custody informant witnesses, as recommended 
			in

			<br />
			Unfortunately, Douglas and Powell are not alone in their experiences 
			with a prosecution that withheld important evidence. Such acts are 
			the most common type of prosecutorial misconduct that leads to 
			wrongful convictions. The flawed trial that led to the wrongful 
			convictions and death sentences of Douglas and Powell, along with 
			the cases of the 136 death row exonerees before them, again 
			highlight the urgent need for reform to address the common causes 
			that lead to wrongful convictions. As exonerations continue to occur 
			throughout the country, it is abundantly clear reform is needed to 
			stem the tide of wrongful convictions and begin to restore 
			credibility, fairness, and accuracy to our criminal justice system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span class="style17">According to deathpenaltyinfo.org, 8 Oklahomans

		<br />
		Dallas County Texas retested their DNA evidence in early 2008 and found 
		17 inmates who were wrongfully convicted! 17 inmates doesn&#39;t sound like 
		a large number, but we&#39;re not talking about inmates who had spent 30 
		days in prison or 3 years! Charles Chatman spent 27 years behind bars! 
		27 years! before DNA evidence cleared him. How many inmates do we have 
		with no DNA evidence available in their cases? How many wrongfully 
		convicted people do we have in our prisons? There has to be a better 
		way! These are lives we&#39;re talking about!!! And not just their lives, 
		but their families&#39; lives as well!<br />

		Charles Ray Giddens Oklahoma Conviction: 1978, Charges Dismissed: 1981 *<br />
		Giddens, an 18-year-old black man, was convicted for the murder of a 
		grocery store cashier primarily on the testimony of Johnnie Gray, who 
		claimed he accompanied Giddens to the murder scene. Although Gray was 
		never indicted, Giddens was sentenced to death after an all white jury 
		deliberated for only 15 minutes. Giddens conviction and death sentence 
		reversed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, which found Gray&#39;s 
		testimony was unreliable and the evidence against Giddens insufficient. 
		(Giddens v. State, No. F-78-164 (Ct. of Crim. App., 11/17/81)) The 
		charges against Giddens were dropped.<br />
		<br />
		Clifford Henry Bowen Oklahoma Conviction: 1981, Charges Dismissed: 1986<br />
		Bowen was incarcerated in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary under three 
		death sentences for over five years when the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
		the Tenth Circuit finally overturned his conviction in 1986. The Court 
		held that prosecutors in the case failed to disclose information about 
		another suspect, Lee Crowe, and that had the defense known of the Crowe 
		materials, the result of the trial would probably have been different. 
		Crowe resembled Bowen, had greater motive, no alibi, and habitually 
		carried the same gun and unusual ammunition as the murder weapon. Bowen, 
		on the other hand, maintained his innocence, provided twelve alibi 
		witnesses to confirm that he was 300 miles from the crime scene just one 
		hour prior to the crime, and could not be linked by any physical 
		evidence to the crime. (Bowen v. Maynard, 799 F.2d 593 (10th Cir. 1986) 
		and Oklahoma Publishing Co., 7/31/87).<br />

		Richard Neal Jones Oklahoma Convicted 1983 Acquitted 1988<br />
		Jones was sentenced to death in Oklahoma in 1983. Jones maintains that 
		he was passed out while his three co-defendants murdered Charles Keene. 
		On appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma remanded the case 
		for retrial. The Court held the jury was prejudiced by the improper 
		admission of hearsay testimony and inflammatory photographs. The Court 
		also agreed with Jones&#39; assertion that the case should be remanded on 
		the basis of prosecutorial misconduct. Moreover, the Court held, the 
		case was not one in which Jones&#39; guilt was &quot;overwhelming&quot; and that 
		Jones&#39; involvement was disputed by the evidence. (Jones v. State, 738 
		P.2d 525 (Okla. crim. app. 1987) and Oklahoma Publishing Co., 1/18/88).<br />

		Gregory R. Wilhoit Oklahoma Conviction: 1987, Acquitted: 1993<br />
		Convicted of killing his estranged wife while she slept. His conviction 
		was overturned and he was released in 1991 when 11 forensic experts 
		testified that a bite mark found on his dead wife did not belong to him. 
		The appeals court also found ineffective assistance of counsel. He was 
		acquitted at a retrial in April, 1993. (Wilhoit v. State, 816 P.2d 545 
		(Okla. Crim. App. 1991) and The Daily Oklahoman, 4/1/93).<br />

		Robert Lee Miller, Jr. Oklahoma Conviction: 1988, Charges Dismissed: 
		1998*<br />
		Miller was convicted of the rape and murder of two elderly women in 
		1988. In 1995, Miller&#39;s original conviction was overturned and he was 
		granted a new trial when DNA evidence pointed to another suspect who was 
		already incarcerated on similar charges. In February, 1997, Oklahoma 
		County Special Judge Larry Jones dismissed the charges against Miller, 
		saying that there was not enough evidence to justify his continued 
		imprisonment. One month later, Oklahoma County District Judge Karl Gray 
		reinstated the charges in response to an appeal by the District 
		Attorney&#39;s office; however, the prosecution ultimately decided to drop 
		all charges and Miller was released. (Barry Scheck, et al., Actual 
		Innocence (Doubleday 2000) and The Daily Oklahoman, 3/1/97).<br />

		Ronald Keith Williamson Oklahoma Conviction: 1988, Charges Dismissed: 
		1999<br />
		Ronald Williamson and Dennis Fritz were charged with the murder and rape 
		of Deborah Sue Carter, which occurred in Ada, Oklahoma in 1982. They 
		were arrested four years after the crime. Both were convicted and 
		Williamson received the death penalty. In 1997, a federal appeals court 
		overturned Williamson&#39;s conviction on the basis of ineffectiveness of 
		counsel (Williamson v. Ward, 110 F.3d 1508 (10th Cir. 1997) aff&#39;g 904 F. 
		Supp. 1529 (E. D. OK 1995)). The Court noted that the lawyer had failed 
		to investigate and present to the jury the fact that another man had 
		confessed to the crime. The lawyer had been paid a total of $3,200 for 
		the defense. Recently, DNA tests from the crime scene did not match 
		either Williamson or Fritz, but did implicate Glen Gore, a former 
		suspect in the case. All charges against the two defendants were 
		dismissed on April 15, 1999 and they were released. Williamson suffers

		Curtis Edward McCarty Oklahoma Conviction: 1986, Charges Dismissed: 2007<br />
		McCarty, who had been sentenced to die three times and has spent 21 
		years on death row for a crime he did not commit, has been released 
		after District Court Judge Twyla Mason Gray ordered that the charges 
		against him be dismissed. Gray ruled that the case against McCarty was 
		tainted by the questionable testimony of former police chemist Joyce 
		Gilchrist, who gave improper expert testimony about semen and hair 
		evidence during McCarty&#39;s trial. Oklahoma County District Attorney David 
		Prater said his office will not appeal Gray&#39;s decision. According to the 
		New York-based Innocence Project, an organization that assisted McCarty 
		in his efforts to prove his innocence, during McCarty’s first two 
		trials, Gilchrist falsely testified that hairs and other biological 
		evidence showed that McCarty could have been the killer. In both trials, 
		the juries convicted him and he was sentenced to death. In Gilchrist’s 
		original notes, hairs from the crime scene did not match McCarty. She 
		then changed her notes to say the hairs did match him. When the defense 
		requested retesting, the hairs were lost. A judge has said Gilchrist 
		either destroyed or willfully lost the hairs. DNA testing in recent 
		years has also shown that another person raped the victim. McCarty&#39;s has 
		maintained his innocence since his arrest.<br />
		(The Oklahoman, May 11, 2007 and The Innocence Project)<br />

		Average number of years between being sentenced to death and 
		exoneration: 9.5 years<br />
		Number of cases in which DNA played a substantial factor in establishing 
		innocence: 17</span></font></p>

		</p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">Monday, April 28, 2008</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">CHICAGO -- Tabitha Pollock was asleep 
		when her boyfriend killed her 3-year-old daughter. Charged with 
		first-degree murder because prosecutors believed she should have known 
		of the danger, Pollock spent more than six years in prison before the 
		Illinois Supreme Court threw out the conviction.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">&quot;Should have known,&quot; the high court 
		ruled, was not nearly enough to keep Pollock behind bars.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">Five years later, Pollock remains in 
		limbo, freed from prison but not free from the snags of a wrongful 
		conviction that upended her life. With a felony record, she cannot 
		become a teacher, as she wants. She cannot collect damages from the 
		Illinois government. On a trip to Australia, where customs officials 
		questioned her when she arrived, she learned that the murder conviction 
		always follows her.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">To fully clear her name, Pollock -- as 
		well as a dozen or so other former Illinois inmates who have been 
		exonerated -- needs an official pardon, which only the governor can 
		give. She applied in 2002 but has received no word.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">&quot;I was raised to believe America is a 
		wonderful country, but I have serious doubts about Illinois now,&quot; said 
		Pollock, 37. &quot;This whole experience has taught me not to have any hopes 
		or dreams.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">A spokesman for Gov. Rod Blagojevich 
		(D) said last month that the governor is flooded with petitions and has 
		not had time to focus on Pollock&#39;s case.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">Pollock&#39;s predicament is becoming more 
		common across the country as more people are exonerated. The New 
		York-based Innocence Project has tallied 215 wrongful convictions in the 
		United States that have been reversed on the basis of DNA evidence.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">Many of those former prisoners are 
		seeking redress from the governments that mistakenly jailed them -- but 
		they are kept waiting, whether because of the slow pace of bureaucracy 
		or a lack of procedures or political will to handle their cases.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" color="#000000" class="style19">When the authorities do not certify 
		innocence, &quot;in effect, the sentence just goes on,&quot; said Stephen Saloom, 
		policy director of the Innocence Project. Noting that legislators are 
		recognizing &quot;the lingering problems&quot; of the exonerated after their 
		release, he said 22 states and the District provide official 
		compensation in one form or another.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" color="#000000" class="style19">&quot;A recent trend is not only to 
		compensate at a monetary value per year incarcerated, but also to 
		provide immediate services upon release,&quot; said Saloom, who said the 
		project&#39;s clients spent an average of 11 years in prison. Advocates say 
		the exonerated need help making the transition back into society, 
		especially finding a job.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" color="#000000" class="style19">&quot;It&#39;s not enough to let the person out 
		of prison,&quot; Saloom said.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">Alabama pays exonerated ex-prisoners 
		$50,000 for each year they were incarcerated. New Jersey pays $40,000 or 
		twice the inmate&#39;s previous annual income. Louisiana offers $15,000 a 
		year plus counseling, medical care and job training, according to 
		Northwestern University&#39;s Center on Wrongful Convictions.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">In Illinois, to regain a certifiably 
		clean record and collect compensation -- a lump payment of $60,150 for 
		five years or less in prison, or $120,300 for six to 14 years -- an 
		exonerated inmate must obtain a &quot;pardon based on innocence&quot; from the 
		governor. A 15-member state review board interviews the petitioners and 
		makes a recommendation, but the governor is not obligated to make a 
		decision.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">&quot;The governor is not acting on them,&quot; 
		said Karen Daniel, senior staff lawyer with the Center on Wrongful 
		Convictions, which is pressing Blagojevich to decide on Pollock&#39;s case 
		and others. &quot;In most of these cases, it&#39;s really not a hard decision. 
		Sometimes there&#39;s still some controversy left after the conviction is 
		thrown out, but in most of these cases there is no disagreement.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">Illinois law gives exonerated former 
		prisoners fewer services than paroled convicts. A bill recently passed 
		by the Illinois House and now under consideration by the Senate would 
		change that, while allowing cleared inmates to receive a &quot;certificate of 
		innocence,&quot; which would have the same power as a pardon, without going 
		to the governor.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">Robert Wilson&#39;s experience with the 
		Chicago courts was a case of mistaken identity. He spent nine years 
		behind bars for another man&#39;s crime, and it haunts him still.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">On Feb. 28, 1997, someone slashed June 
		Siler, 24, with a box cutter as she waited for a bus on Chicago&#39;s South 
		Side. The next day, at the same bus stop, police arrested Wilson. 
		Interrogated for nearly 30 hours, he signed a written confession and was 
		charged with attempted murder.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" color="#000000" class="style19">Wilson pleaded not guilty, but Siler 
		pointed him out in court as the man who cut her face and throat. What 
		the jury did not know was that five other victims -- all white, as Siler 
		was -- were attacked and slashed at Chicago bus stops in the two weeks 
		after Wilson&#39;s arrest. The slasher was caught and confessed, but police 
		never asked him about the Siler case.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">Nine years later, on an appeal filed 
		by the Northwestern team, a court ruled that the jury should have been 
		told about the other cases. Siler came forward and said she had fingered 
		the wrong man.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">Wilson, at long last, was free. Yet he 
		left prison with few prospects and deeply in debt because he was 
		assessed child support for his three boys while behind bars. These days, 
		his boys are teenagers and he is &quot;barely making it.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">&quot;I feel so bad, I figure I would be 
		better off back in the penitentiary,&quot; said Wilson, 52. &quot;Whenever I apply 
		for a job, they see the criminal record and say no. I&#39;m not asking for 
		welfare or a handout; just give me what I deserve.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">Marlon Pendleton is also bitter. In 
		1993, a rape and robbery victim picked him from a police lineup. His 
		attorneys believe that the victim was influenced by seeing Pendleton in 
		handcuffs before she viewed the entire group. Although he repeatedly 
		asked for DNA testing, he was told it would be impossible.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">In 2006, a DNA test established his 
		innocence and Pendleton went free. But he has not been pardoned, has not 
		received compensation and has not seen the conviction wiped off his 
		record. Unable to meet the mortgage, his family lost his late mother&#39;s 
		home in Gary, Ind. He says his children are suffering.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">&quot;I can&#39;t get a job,&quot; Pendleton said. 
		&quot;Every time I fill out an application, it comes up. What can you do with 
		a prison record and a not very good education? Life has been a living 
		hell.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">Daniel, the Northwestern lawyer, said 
		the number of exonerated inmates &quot;probably seems small&quot; in a nation with 
		2 million people behind bars. &quot;But to me, it&#39;s important.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">&quot;It&#39;s just an enormous wrong we&#39;ve 
		inflicted on these people, not necessarily intentionally,&quot; Daniel said. 
		&quot;His possessions are gone, job is gone, family members are often gone. 
		There&#39;s little worse a government can do to a person. We can&#39;t in good 
		conscience have a so-called criminal justice system unless we make 
		people whole when we screw up.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">One of Daniel&#39;s clients is Marcus 
		Lyons, a former Navy Reservist and aspiring computer programmer who 
		spent three years in prison on an erroneous sexual assault conviction.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">　</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" color="#000000" class="style19">Lyons was so distraught that after his 
		release in 1991, he tried to nail himself to a cross outside the DuPage 
		County Courthouse.</font></p>
		<p class="style19"><font color="#000000">DDNA evidence cleared him last year. He 
		is still waiting for the Illinois government to make amends. </font></p>
