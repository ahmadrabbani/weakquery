<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Since 1989, the project has 
helped exonerate 217 people using DNA evidence, a major new 
investigative tool; 16 of them served time on death row. In 82 cases,

convictions in the state.<br>
<br>
But frankly, this page likes even more the approach to the problem being 


used by the district attorney's office in</font> <st1:City

size="3">Dallas</font></st1:place></st1:City><font

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">District Attorney Craig Watkins 


is using a $453,900 grant from the New York-based Justice, Equality, 
Human Dignity and Tolerance Foundation to pay for post-conviction DNA

hundreds of requests by inmates, including requests denied under the

<br>
This attempt to free wrongly convicted people comes at a time when there 


is a proliferation of cases overturned by new DNA evidence nationwide. 
In</font> <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><font face="Times 
New Roman" size="3">Texas</font></st1:place></st1:State> <font 
size="3">since 2001, DNA testing has cleared 33 people who spent a 
combined 427 years in prison.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Or consider that locally, 


DNA evidence was responsible for freeing Douglas Warney in 2006 from

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">The Warney case, no 
doubt, helped persuade the New York Bar to study wrongful criminal 
convictions and propose solutions.<br>
<br>
A final report is expected to be issued by the bar in April 2009, but it 


shouldn't take another year to figure out the merit of programs like the 


one in</font> <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><font face="Times

<br>
It's bad enough that people are behind bars who shouldn't be there. Add 
to this travesty the fact that this predicament undermines confidence in 


the judicial system, and wrongful convictions become nothing short of a

<h2>To right the wrongs, Newsday</h2>

<h2><font color="#000000">Group will study wrongful 
convictions</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Wrongful convictions 
produce not only a nightmare for the person serving the time without 
having committed the crime, but a nest of problems for the rest of us. 
That includes the costs of the actual imprisonment, plus millions of 
dollars in damages that the state must pay exonerated inmates, and the 
sickening knowledge that the real perpetrators have been on the loose, 
probably committing other crimes.<br>
<br>
Now the new president of the</font> <i><font face="Times New Roman" 
size="3">New York State Bar Association</font></i></font><font 
face="Times New Roman" size="3">, Bernice Leber, is doing something 
about it. She has appointed a task force to study cases of wrongful 
conviction, examine the faults in the criminal justice system that led 
to them, and recommend legislation to fix what's broken.<br>
<br>
The chairman of the task force will be Barry Kamins, immediate past 
president of the New York City Bar Association. Among others, it 
includes prosecutors, retired judges, law professors, and 
representatives of the Fortune Society, which helps inmates re-enter 
society, and the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City.<br>
<br>
This page has endorsed legislation sponsored by Assemb. Michael Gianaris 


(D-Astoria), setting up a permanent innocence commission to review the 
cases of exonerated inmates. That bill is still making its way through 
the State Legislature. Meanwhile, the state bar's task force will play a 


similar role, except on a temporary basis, and with no need for 
legislative action to get its work started.<br>
<br>
Leber wants the task force to finish by next April. That would allow 
time for the legislature to act next year on its recommendations. We 
hope the Gianaris bill will have passed by then, but if not, the report 
should give it a welcome boost. We need to examine faults in the 
criminal justice system.<br>

<h2>Tankleff pushes for video recording of interrogations, Newsday</h2>

<p><font color="#000000">By Zachary R. Dowdy</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">In his first public 
appearance since having murder charges dropped against him, Martin 
Tankleff said he was lucky to have his family, high-caliber attorneys on 


his side, and a public that supported him in his drive to overturn his 
conviction for the 1988 murders of his parents.<br>
<br>
"I was one of the fortunate ones," he said, testifying in upper</font> 
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><font face="Times New Roman" 
size="3">Manhattan</font></st1:place></st1:City></font> <font 
face="Times New Roman" size="3">about his plight before a task force 
designed to explore criminal justice reforms. "I wrote over 50,000 
letters. I was able to recruit the support of many, many lawyers and 
major law firms. There's too many men in prison who didn't get that 
luck."<br>
<br>
After Tankleff's address before the New York State Senate Democratic 
Task Force on Criminal Justice Reform, two state legislators, state Sen. 


Eric Schneiderman (D-Manhattan), the task force's chairman, and Assemb. 
Michael Gianaris (D-Astoria), apologized for the role the criminal 
justice system played in imprisoning Tankleff and for taking so long to 
reverse itself.<br>
<br>
"I cannot say enough how much all of us in public service and in 
government are really embarrassed and upset by what happened to you," 
Schneiderman said. "I'm sorry it took so long."<br>
<br>
He said the State Senate, through forums like the one Tankleff spoke at 
and the legislation it hopes to draft, will strive to put in place 
reforms that "could prevent this from happening again."<br>
<br>
Tankleff pushed for videotaped interrogations, saying a recording of his 


questioning by detectives would have documented his innocence.<br>
<br>
"Had my interrogation been recorded, I would not have served 6,338 days 
in prison," he said.<br>
<br>
Tankleff, who had been sentenced to 50 years to life in prison, said 
further, "There's no downside to recording. The truth gets exposed. ... 
Does 17 years of my life cost as much as it does to record 
interrogations? How many other men have to serve time in prison because 
somebody says it costs too much? I can record this entire event on my 
cell phone. It's ridiculous."Opponents of recording interrogations say 
defendants' rights are adequately protected already and that videotaping 


the process offers few benefits.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">On Monday, state 
Attorney General Andrew Cuomo dropped murder charges against Tankleff, 
whose conviction for the Sept. 7, 1988, murders of his parents, Arlene 
and Seymour Tankleff, was overturned by a state appellate panel in 
December. Cuomo's office stepped in and began investigating the case 
anew after Suffolk District Attorney Thomas Spota said he would move to 
drop the charges.<br>
<br>
The event also featured testimony from Alan Netwon, who was convicted of 


a rape, spent 21 years in prison and was later exonerated, and legal 
experts such as</font> <i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">New York

Assemblymembers Michael Gianaris (D-Queens), Adriano Espaillat 
(D-Manhattan), Rory Lancman (D-Queens) and Ellen Young (D-Queens), and 
leading criminal justice advocates took part in a public forum to 
address wrongful convictions and the creation of an independent 
&#8220;Innocence Commission&#8221; in New York State.<br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&#160;<br>
 At the forum, testimony was presented by exonerees Martin Tankleff and 
Alan Newton, Steve Saloom of The Innocence Project, which is affiliated 
with the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, Bernice Leber, President of 
the</font> <i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">New York State Bar 
Association</font></i></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">, 
Barry Kamins, Chair of the NYS Bar Association&#8217;s Task Force on 
Wrongful Convictions, and Jonathan Gradess, Executive Director of the 
New York State Defenders Association.<br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&#160;<br>
 Schneiderman, who chairs the New York State Senate Democratic Task 
Force on Criminal Justice Reform and also serves as the ranking Democrat 


on the Senate Codes Committee and as a Commissioner on the New York 
State Commission on Sentencing Reform, has worked to ensure that the 
guilty are punished and innocent persons are (safeguarded). Testimony 
from today&#8217;s forum will be used to develop legislation that 
ensures the public&#8217;s trust in</font> <st1:State 
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">New 


York</font></st1:place></st1:State></font><font face="Times New Roman" 
size="3">&#8217;s criminal justice system.<br>
&#160;<br>
 &#8220;No one who is entrusted with ensuring the integrity of our 
criminal justice process&#8212;and most importantly the legislators who 
make our laws&#8212;can, in good conscience, ignore the prevalence of 
wrongful convictions in our state,&#8221; Senator Schneiderman 
said.&#160; &#8220;There are known flaws in the system, with eyewitness 
identification, interrogations, and preservation of and post-conviction 
access to DNA, that we can and should remedy.&#160; There are also 
contributing factors that we don&#8217;t understand, and we have a 
responsibility to identify and remedy those as well.&#8221;<br>
&#160;<br>
 Testifying today about the need for reform in our criminal justice 
system was Martin Tankleff, who was convicted and sentenced to 
50-years-to-life after allegedly confessing to his parents&#8217; 
double-homicide. Last year, after serving over 17 years in prison, the 
New York State Appellate Court 2nd Department unanimously overturned his 


conviction.&#160; On Monday, the office of New York State Attorney 
General Andrew Cuomo vacated his indictments and decided not to retry 
Mr. Tankleff.<br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&#160;<br>
 &#8220;I clearly do not want another person to experience what I have 
been experiencing for nearly twenty years,&#8221; said Mr. 
Tankleff.&#160; &#8220;The larger meaning of my case is to point out the 


gaps in our system, which is that when there is a horrible, obvious 
mistake made, there is no mechanism for correcting it. To leave it to 
the judicial and prosecutorial entities to correct their own mistakes is 


what leads the wrongfully convicted, like myself, to remain imprisoned 
for many, many years.&#8221;<br>
&#160;<br>
 Steve Saloom, Policy Director at The Innocence Project, indicated that 
the circumstances in the Tankleff case were not unique.&#160; The 
Innocence Project has helped to exonerate 215 individuals in the</font> 
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><font face="Times New 


Roman" size="3">United States</font></st1:place></st1:country-region> 
<font size="3">since 1989. According to Saloom, &#8220;Twenty-three 
people in</font> <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><font 
face="Times New Roman" size="3">New York</font></st1:place></st1:State> 
<font size="3">served years or decades in prison before DNA proved their 


innocence, more than almost any other state in the nation. Nobody 
&#8211; not the police, prosecutors, judges, victims, or the public at 
large &#8211; benefits from these wrongful convictions.&#160; The only 
person who benefits is the real perpetrator of a crime, who eludes 
justice.&#160; In order to restore public faith in the justice system, 
it is critically important that we learn from each wrongful conviction 
by examining their causes and understanding the reforms that can prevent 


them. We applaud the</font> <i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">New 


York Bar Association</font></i></font> <font face="Times New Roman" 
size="3">for taking the first steps towards doing so and we commend 
Senator Schneiderman for convening this Task Force to understand how the 


legislature can best act to prevent wrongful convictions.&#8221;<br>
&#160;<br>
 Saloom and others spoke about the need for an independent innocence 
commission as a tool for addressing wrongful convictions in the state. 
For several years, and without success, the state legislature has sought 


to establish an innocence commission empowered to evaluate the lessons 
of these exonerations. Such a commission would examine each case, with a 


specific eye towards what investigative and court processes &#8211; and 
what prosecutorial and defense shortcomings&#8212;contributed to those 
wrongful convictions.<br>
&#160;<br>
 Such a commission would make recommendations to adopt reforms that 
increase the accuracy of criminal investigations, strengthen 
prosecutions, and protect the innocent.&#160; Many other states have 
learned from wrongful convictions in this manner; they have researched 
cases and potential reforms, heard testimony from experts, and issued 
reports and recommendations on issues including eyewitness 
identifications, false confessions, and forensic laboratory 
oversight.<br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&#160;<br>
 The</font> <i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">New York State Bar 
Association</font></i> <font size="3">recently created a task force of 
criminal justice experts from across the state&#8217;s criminal justice

&#8220;I can think of no worse fear than being imprisoned &#8211; even

&#160;<br>
 &#8220;The Bar Association&#8217;s Task Force has identified 56 cases

the use of DNA testing or based on non-DNA methods, and we plan to

said Barry Kamins, Chair of the recently established Bar Association 
Task Force on Wrongful Convictions.<br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&#160;<br>
 State Senator Velmanette Montgomery, a long time advocate for reforming 


criminal justice policies in New York, continued &#8220;The hundreds of 
exonerations across the nation over the past several years should 
inspire us to fix the cracks in our criminal justice system.&#160; By 
examining current exonerations and recommending ways to reform our 
criminal justice procedures, an independent commission will act as a 
guide to ensure that our criminal justice system is working properly, 
and that we are only convicting the real perpetrator of a 
crime.&#8221;<br>
&#160;<br>
 State Senator Bill Perkins agreed with his colleagues and added, 
&#8220;The</font> <st1:place w:st="on"><font face="Times New Roman" 
size="3">Central Park</font></st1:place></font><font face="Times New 
Roman"><font size="3">Five are perfect examples of how innocent 
individuals can be wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not 
commit.&#160; Frighteningly, if this case had warranted the death 
penalty, then these young men would have had their lives ended because 
our system failed them.&#8221;<br>
&#160;<br>
 &#8220;Just as we study the causes of wrongful deaths, our criminal 
justice system needs an autopsy to determine how to prevent even more 
innocent people from being imprisoned,&#8221; said Assemblyman Michael 
Gianaris (D-Queens), who is the author of legislation to establish an 
Innocence Commission in</font> <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place 
w:st="on"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">New 
York</font></st1:place></st1:State></font><font face="Times New Roman" 
size="3">(Assembly Bill A4317). &#8220;One innocent person spending 
years in prison for crimes he or she did not commit is one too many. 
Unfortunately, recent history proves that the problem is more widespread 


than anyone would like to admit. This is a systemic problem that 
requires a systemic solution. &#8221;<br>
