        <p><i>DISCLOSURE: In 1988 Mr. Marquis convinced a jury I tampered with a 
        witness and evidence, in spite of knowing the crime couldn't physically 
        have happened.&nbsp; Which would take all of 10 minutes to prove in an 
        unbiased setting.&nbsp; But this tale is unrelated to these 
        observations.&nbsp; I criticized prosecutors long before they knocked me 
        off the witness chair.</i></p>
      <p>In an Op-Ed letter to the <i><font face="Arial"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a></font></i>, &quot;<a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70815F93B5B0C758EDDA80894DE404482">The Innocent and the 
      Shammed</a>,&quot; (1/26/06, and later in <i>
      <a href="http://www.oregonian.com/">The Oregonian</a></i>, Oregon DA Josh 
      Marquis bemoans the recent concern over wrongful convictions, which he 
      maintains are a popular misconception.&nbsp; The reality, he says, is that 
      we should be far more worried about the wrongfully freed than the 
      wrongfully convicted.&nbsp; He boasts the justice system is right 99.973% 
      of the time and wrong only .027% of the time.&nbsp; If he is right, this 
      means that out of 100,000 convictions, 99,973 are justified and only 27 
      aren't.</p>
      <p>No wonder he crows: &quot;Most industries would like to claim such a record 
      of efficiency.&quot;&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; And when they find out they'll cram 
      courtrooms to see how prosecutors do it.</p>
      <p>However, he extrapolated his fanciful numbers by fudging a <font face="Arial"><a href="http://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a></font> report titled: <i>Exonerations in the United States: 1989 
      through 2003</i>. <font size="2">[<a href="http://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/exonerations-in-us.pdf">PDF/Adobe 
      Acrobat</a>]</font></p>
      <p>Lead author, University of Michigan law professor Samuel Gross, 
      responded:</p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>&nbsp;Marquis declared that after an exhaustive 
       study, several students and I were able to document only 340 innocent 
       defendants who were exonerated between 1989 and 2003.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;In fact, we also discussed hundreds more 
       documented cases in mass exonerations that were not part of our 
       statistical analysis.&nbsp; Our purpose was not to count exonerations, 
       but to use the few false convictions that came to light to learn 
       something about the many we never see.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;Almost all the individual exonerations we 
       found were for the rarest and most violent crimes, murder and rape.&nbsp; 
       Are we to believe that false convictions basically never occur in drug 
       cases, robberies or frauds?</p>
       <p>&nbsp;Nobody knows how many false convictions 
       happen in America.&nbsp; A rough guess from a recent DNA review, for rape 
       convictions in Virginia, is very troubling, about 1 in 14.&nbsp; Whatever 
       the number, we should work to solve this tragic problem, not ignore it.

      </blockquote>
      <p>Reading Mr. Marquis's boast is like hearing the CEO of a drug firm that 
      uses experimentally untested methods and doesn't run product checks or 
      punish employee dishonesty declare the product's nearly glitch-free.&nbsp; 
      Without any way to know how many glitches there are.&nbsp; Even though we 
      read about them most every day. (Google 
      <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&rls=GGLD,GGLD:2004-29,GGLD:en&q=&quot;Wrongful+Convictions&quot;&btnG=Search">&quot;Wrongful Convictions&quot;</a> and 
      <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&rls=GGLD,GGLD:2004-29,GGLD:en&q=&quot;Innocence+Project&quot;&btnG=Search">&quot;Innocence Project&quot;</a>)</p>
      <p>According to his surreal calculus, for every 1000 prisoners, 999 are 
      truly guilty and one unfortunate is wrongfully convicted.&nbsp; Or, of 
      some 4000 now on death row, 4 are innocent.&nbsp; And, of 1008 executed 
      since 1976, when the Supremes reinstated the death penalty, 2 were 
      innocent.</p>
      <p>But Mr. Marquis's numbers result from a disconnect between solid facts 
      in the real world and airy factiles in his alternate reality.&nbsp; 
      From 1973 through February of 2006, according to the
      <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information 
      Center</a>, 15 inmates were 
      freed because of DNA evidence, and 108 because of other evidence.&nbsp; 
      The <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/">Innocence Project</a> notes 
      that, as of the end of February, 2006, 174 prisoners were exonerated by 
      DNA after traditional appeals failed.</p>
      <p><a name="fn1r">Connors</a>, et al.,<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> note, from 1989, in about 25% of the sexual assault 
      cases referred to the FBI, the primary suspect has been excluded by 
      forensic DNA testing where results could be obtained.&nbsp; As it is, 
      released prisoners were lucky the victims were raped.&nbsp; If they hadn't 
      been, there wouldn't have been any semen to test and they'd still be 
      locked up, some on death row.&nbsp; They state &quot;These results strongly 
      suggest DNA exonerations &quot;are tied to some strong, underlying systemic 
      problems that generate erroneous accusations and convictions [and 
      indicate] the extent of factually incorrect convictions in our system must 
      be much greater than anyone wants to believe.&quot;</p>
      <p><i><font size="2">(Webmaster's note: their
      <a href="../volume10/j10_3.htm">article</a> was reprinted in the 1998 IPT 
      Journal)</font></i></p>
      <p><a name="fn2r">Lawrence</a> Marshall<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> comments on DNA testing and wrongful convictions and<br>
      the error rate:</p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>The great significance of DNA testing, therefore, is that it provides 
       a window into the error rate that exists in <i>all</i> cases.&nbsp; 
       Moreover, as Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld, and Jim Dwyer argued so 
       powerfully in their book, <i>Actual Innocence</i>, DNA exonerations 
       provide great insights into the fallibility of particular types of 
       evidence that were once assumed extraordinarily trustworthy.&nbsp; When 
       DNA teaches us lessons about the incidence of eyewitness error or false 
       confessions, those lessons are not limited to DNA cases.&nbsp; They apply 
       with great force to cases not susceptible to forensic testing (p. 574).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><a name="fn3r">Scheck</a>, et. al,<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> note:</p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>Today, DNA tests are used before trial.&nbsp; For this unseen legion of 
      innocent suspects, only the genetic tests halted their forced march from 
      wrongly accused to wrongly convicted.&nbsp; How many other innocent 
      people, charged with crimes that involve no biological evidence, were 
      chained and led at a gunpoint into prison?&nbsp; Thousands, these tests 
      suggest, far more than the most jaded or cynical scholars ever envisioned 
      (p. xv).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In the 1980s there were hundreds of accusations of ritualistic satanic 
      sexual abuse in day care centers and other settings.&nbsp; Teachers 
      supposedly made kids eat poop sandwiches and sip pee cool-aid; stabbed 
      babies and drank their blood; danced around the classroom naked; pooped on 
      the flag; slipped them into toy parachutes, took them up in a hot air 
      balloon, and threatened to toss them out if they told; hung them naked 
      upside down in a refrigerator; stuffed knifes, forks, spoons, teddy bears, 
      even peanut butter in their body cavities and farted in their faces, etc.</p>
      <p>Ambition trumped common sense.&nbsp; Prosecutors took advantage of the 
      hysteria and swarmed on these cases like flies on a dead fish.&nbsp; 
      Countless innocent people were caught up in the madness and given 
      prolonged prison sentences.&nbsp; Despite the fact these claims were 
      totally without foundation.&nbsp; In 1992 Kenneth Lanning (<font face="Arial"><a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a></font> <font face="Arial"> <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/programs/academy/bsu.htm">Behavioral 
    Science Unit</a></font>) reported that not only were no bodies ever found, they never 
      found physical evidence for the sacrifices involving sex, blood, and 
      mutilation.</p>
      <p>Hysteria over Satan in day care centers has been replaced by &quot;recovered 
      memories&quot; of long ago abuse.&nbsp; (Fiction: The intact and accurate 
      &quot;memory,&quot; long hidden from consciousness, lurks in some deep' mental 
      crevice only to pop to the surface when released like a methane bubble 
      trapped in the bottom of a lake.)&nbsp; The claims are just as unfounded 
      in fact and bogus as satanic ritual abuse in day care centers.&nbsp; Which 
      doesn't stop eager prosecutors and plaintiffs lawyers from using the 
      system to gull juries into believing they're real.</p>
      <p>Death penalty cases are, in theory anyway, tried with the greatest care 
      against convicting someone who's innocent.&nbsp; If there are wrongful 
      convictions in these cases, it's reasonable to think there are more where 
      lesser crimes are charged.</p>
      <p>Before we can talk rationally about getting together as a community to 
      kill somebody, it makes sense to look at how we decide who to kill and how 
      wrong it's OK to be.&nbsp; Yet nobody knows the odds in the system 
      seasoned lawyers call a &quot;crap shoot&quot; because there's no quality control 
      built into this way to decide things.</p>
      <p>Our system is only one of many.&nbsp; We could fight, toss coins, use 
      dunking stools, read chicken entrails and planetary motions, verify 
      information in ways others can validate (scientific method), have each of 
      two sides cite information in favor of its position while fighting to keep 
      the other side from doing the same (adversarial method).</p>
      <p>Yet, the adversary system's never been experimentally compared with 
      other ways to decide things.&nbsp; Some think using it to settle an issue 
      in the 21st century is like doing microsurgery with a broadax.&nbsp; And 
      it's a fair bet nobody wants to go under the knife of a surgeon trained, 
      like a jury, by exposure to conflicting techniques presented by people 
      with a stake in the action, who, for a fee, would hawk the other side with 
      as much gusto.</p>
      <p>It's a system built on tradition, massive vested interest, and the 
      scientifically untested, imperious, belief it works.&nbsp; Now, it's fine 
      to use faith for religion, our hearts for romance, and myth for fairy 
      tales.&nbsp; But we don't want pilots to rely on their lucky rabbit's foot 
      when an engine goes out.&nbsp; Without quality controls there's no way to 
      gauge how many mistakes we make, or why.&nbsp; And no way to decide how 
      many are acceptable.&nbsp; If the court system were a business, it 
      wouldn't last a week.</p>
      <p><a name="fn4r">Mr</a>. Marquis writes we &quot;have an entire appeals court 
      system intended to intervene in those few cases where the innocent are in 
      jeopardy.&quot;&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; When non-lawyers read a decision will be 
      &quot;appealed&quot; they think a panel of judges examines the case from scratch.&nbsp; 
      They don't know appellate courts accept trial outcomes as &quot;fact&quot; and only 
      ask if procedures and constitutional rights were violated.&nbsp; F. Lee 
      Bailey observed &quot;Appellate courts have only one function, and that is to 
      correct legal mistakes of a serious nature made by a judge at a lower 
      level.&nbsp; Should a jury have erred by believing a lying witness, or by 
      drawing an attractive but misleading inference, there's nothing to 
      appeal.&quot;<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>
      <p>If wrongfully convicted prisoners can't convince appellate justices 
      there were legal errors in the trial, and usually they can't, they're 
      sunk.&nbsp; Even physical proof of innocence is irrelevant.&nbsp; 
      Reversals are rare and often granted when it can't be
      avoided, or when a case is in the media spotlight.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court severely limited <i>habeas</i> petitions. The 
      majority wrote they threaten &quot;to undermine the integrity of the <i>habeas 
      corpus</i> process&quot; and show &quot;disrespect for the finality of convictions 
      [which] disparages the entire criminal justice system.&quot;&nbsp; (What if a 
      drug company used this reasoning to squelch new data about a pill's toxic 
      side-effects?)</p>
      <p>The notion of &quot;finality&quot; implies court outcomes are virtually 
      errorless.&nbsp; Or the number of mistakes is irrelevant if we don't know 
      it, and the machinery looks like it works.&nbsp; (Other than family and 
      friends, who's to know someone's wrongly convicted?&nbsp; People who learn 
      about the conviction assume it's correct, crime doesn't pay, and, so the 
      theory goes, are more likely to keep their noses clean.)</p>
      <p>This is an irresponsible way to run any outfit.&nbsp; We want widget 
      makers to take apart randomly picked widgets to see if they do what 
      widgets are supposed to do.&nbsp; We expect engineers to do the same with 
      O-rings and pill-makers with pills.&nbsp; Quality control testing simply 
      asks how often the product does what it's designed to do, how often it 
      doesn't, and why not. It's the only way to decide how well a system works.</p>
      <p>Judges and prosecutors are immune from civil or criminal accountability 
      for acts which fall under the broad umbrella of their jobs.&nbsp; So 
      mistakes are guaranteed by more than the focus on winning over objective 
      inquiry.&nbsp; Ample case law shows prosecutors can hide evidence, make it 
      up, destroy it, lie about it, get others to lie about it, and bribe and 
      threaten witnesses without penalty.</p>
      <p>Lack of accountability is the common denominator in most mischief we 
      cause one another.&nbsp; Human nature being what it is, people who have a 
      pass on liability are more likely to break the rules than people who don't 
      have it.&nbsp; Especially if there's a payoff.&nbsp; In the adversary 
      system, the payoff's winning.&nbsp; A shield against penalties for 
      rule-breaking is a license to break them.&nbsp; <i>(Who'd you get a used 
      car from?&nbsp; Honest Abe, who'd get the book thrown at him if he was 
      caught rolling back the odometer?&nbsp; Or Honest Jake, who'd simply be 
      told not to misbehave?)</i></p>
      <p>Until law schools matriculate Mother Teresas, it's reasonable to assume 
      prosecutors and judges are open to the same temptations that beset the 
      rest of us.&nbsp; That they fib at least as much as anybody else.&nbsp; 
      It's unreasonable to say they fib less.&nbsp; This doesn't mean they're 
      dishonest.&nbsp; Just that they're allowed to be.</p>
      <p>Taxpayers foot the bill for an industry which affects every aspect of 
      their lives.&nbsp; But they're kept in more ignorance and have less to say 
      about it than Catholics have about Papal Bulls.&nbsp; The American 
      Judicial System is a state-funded, secular religion backed by myth, 
      secrecy, big bucks, and whopping hardware.&nbsp; That's not to say it 
      isn't, at times, a magnificent, even brilliant, structure.&nbsp; But if 
      the foundation's flawed, the whole thing's flawed.</p>
      <p>So how about some transparency so can we learn more about how it works, 
      check its batting average, and cut down the error rate?&nbsp; And let's do 
      more than give lip service to the notion of accountability up and down the 
      line.</p>
      <p>For starters, put cameras in courtrooms (including the Supreme Court).&nbsp; 
      Unless state secrets are in play, it's devious and hypocritical to keep us 
      in the dark about what goes on in our courts.&nbsp; Justice Breyer huffed 
      there'll be cameras in court over his &quot;dead body.&quot;&nbsp; A nice man's 
      arrogant stance, as eventually doomed as the effort to keep women out of 
      the voting booth.</p>
      <p>Hospital teams review botched medical procedures, and the 
      <a href="http://www.faa.gov/">FAA</a> 
      reconstructs and examines crashes, to find what went wrong and, if 
      possible, keep it from happening again.&nbsp; Let's have watchdog groups 
      (including non-lawyers), with power to subpoena anybody, review cases of 
      wrongful conviction.&nbsp; Let them examine other cases where they suspect 
      the system went astray.</p>
      <p>In a June, 2003, article in <i><a href="http://www.sfbg.com/">The Guardian</a></i>, Mr. Marquis wrote 
      prosecutors &quot;are and should be subject to a high degree of scrutiny by 
      trial and appellate judges, defendants and defense lawyers, the press and 
      bar associations and ultimately the voters.&quot;</p>
      <p>Sounds good.&nbsp; But without consequences for rule breaking it's just 
      more wind.&nbsp; A nationwide study of prosecutorial misconduct, &quot;<a href="http://www.publicintegrity.com/pm/">Harmful 
      Error</a>,&quot; found that in a 33-year period appellate judges dismissed, 
      reversed convictions, or reduced sentences in over 2000 cases because 
      prosecutors had been dishonest.&nbsp; Out of some 30,000 prosecutors in 
      the country, judges cited all of 223 for misconduct and only disbarred 
      two. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1882583183/instituteforpsyc"><img src="../../images/logo_micro_bw.gif" width="17" height="13" alt="Paperback" border="0"></a>)</p>
      <p>Prosecutors have a unique role in our system.&nbsp; In many ways, 
      they're more powerful than judges.&nbsp; And need to be.&nbsp; They're the 
      conscience of the community.&nbsp; Their decision to charge someone with a 
      crime can affect countless lives.&nbsp; It carries awesome responsibility.&nbsp; 
      However, unless it's coupled with corresponding accountability it's 
      guaranteed to subvert the system and result in false convictions.</p>
      <p>There's at least one rule book in every one of the approximately 2,341 
      district attorney offices in the country.&nbsp; Hold prosecutors who break 
      the rules civilly and criminally accountable, and you'll cut down errors 
      overnight.</p>
      <p>On a personal note: Ethics aside, Mr. Marquis is a bright, articulate 
      fellow.&nbsp; He's second to none at crafting his public image as a 
      thoughtful and dedicated prosecutor who tirelessly fights the bad guys.&nbsp; 
      Some say he yearns to snuggle up in the AG's chair.&nbsp; Be that as it 
      may, I can't help but wonder why such an ambitious, intelligent, man would 
      dip into an alternate reality to concoct preposterous percentages which 
      don't exist in the real world.</p>
      <p>Maybe he has a percentile dysfunction.<br>
