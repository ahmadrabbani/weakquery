(AP) _ Saying wrongful convictions undermine public confidence in the justice system, the   New York State Bar Association   president has established a task force of 22 professors, former judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys and others to identify rules, procedures and statutes contributing to the problem.   ``For each wrongful conviction that surfaces, how many others are still unfairly resolved?'' said     Manhattan    attorney Bernice Leber, named president of the 74,000-member association on Monday.    ``The problem of wrongful convictions has reached, I would say, national epidemic status,'' Leber said. Three states _ California, North Carolina and Texas _ have established formal innocence commissions and have exonerated hundreds of people, while similar legislation in New York ``hasn't gained too much traction yet,'' she said. Barry Kamins, past New York City Bar Association president and an adjunct professor at   Brooklyn   and Fordham law schools, will chair the task force. It will analyze    New York      cases statewide that led to wrongful convictions and hold hearings. A final report with proposed reforms is expected in April 2009. ``In New York, the number of cases has really not been collected, I should say studied, with any of the type of detail required in order to reach conclusions about the various causes of wrongful convictions,'' Leber said. She noted work starting in 1992 by attorneys Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld at the Innocence Project based at   Cardozo    Law    School   in    New York      , which says DNA evidence has exonerated 217 people wrongly convicted, including 16 who spent time on death row. The association task force will examine every reported case in    New York     , like that of Anthony Capozzi, who spent 22 years in prison convicted of two rapes. Capozzi, 51, who is schizophrenic, was freed a year ago after DNA evidence proved those attacks were part of a decades-long crime spree in the Buffalo area by killer Altemio Sanchez, also known as the ``Bike Path Rapist.'' The task force will examine the process all along the line, from the innocent person's arrest to interrogation of witnesses, the evidence collected, and everything that happens up to the moment of indictment, Leber said. ``Another interesting facet will be looking at remedies and compensation available to those wrongly convicted,'' she said. For taxpayers, the cost could run into millions of dollars.    A lawsuit seeking $41 million has been filed on behalf of Capozzi, who lives now in an assisted living setting because of the mental illness that worsened in prison. Capozzi was denied parole five times after becoming eligible in 1997 because his refusal to admit the crimes made it impossible to complete a mandatory sex offender program, according to his lawyers.     Erie    County    prosecutors supported his release. ``I truly regret that this had to happen,'' District Attorney Frank Clark has said of the 1987 convictions, ``everybody trying to do the right thing and going through all the right steps and coming out with the wrong result.

Kamins, the immediate past president of the New York City Bar Association, will chair the     New York      State Bar Association's   Task Force on Wrongful Convictions. The panel is the first initiative of Bernice K. Leber, the new state bar president, who said it is incumbent upon the group to take a leadership role in ensuring that no innocent people in New York are punished for crimes they did not commit. Mr. Kamins, of Flamhaft Levy Kamins Hirsch & Rendeiro in   Brooklyn   , said yesterday in an interview that the task force will scour police and court records for cases in which defendants were wrongfully convicted and exonerated, both through DNA and other evidence. "It is our hope that taking a look statewide what has happened to these individuals, that we can draw up a game plan to prevent this from happening in the future," he said. The task force's goal is to aid prosecutors, police, defense counsel and the courts in preventing wrongful prosecutions and convictions, according to Mr. Kamins. Ms. Leber announced yesterday that 21 members have agreed to serve on the task force with Mr. Kamins, including former Court of Appeals Judges Howard Levine and George Bundy Smith and District Attorneys Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn and Janet DeFiore of   Westchester   . The task force will issue a final report in April 2009, Ms. Leber said.    ________________________________________________________________________   June 6, 2008   Editorial, Wrongful convictions, Post-Standard  Know the cases. Understand the causes. Fix the system. That's the mantra of The Innocence Project, a program started at   Cardozo    Law    School   in    New York City    to uncover cases of wrongful conviction.   Since 1989, the project has helped exonerate 217 people using DNA evidence, a major new investigative tool; 16 of them served time on death row. In 82 cases, the actual wrongdoers were identified -- like the killer linked to two rapes after DNA evidence last year freed New Yorker Anthony Capozzi, 51, who had spent 22 years in prison for the crimes.  Wrongful convictions can result from mistaken eyewitness accounts, forensic errors, false confessions or incriminating statements, unreliable jailhouse informants, inadequate defense counsel or prosecutorial or police misconduct.   Three states now have "innocence commissions," though legislation to create one in    New York    languishes. Fortunately, the state bar association now is taking up the matter.    Saying wrongful convictions have reached "epidemic proportions," association President Bernice Leber vows her group's task force will analyze each case from    New York     state, identify what went wrong and how to fix it. The results should be eye-opening. ________________________________________________________________________   June 12, 2008   State Bar Association Studies Wrongful Convictions, WNED  By Jay Moran   The local stories of Lynn DeJac and Anthony Capozzi are just a few of the examples of those who have spent time in prison for crimes they did not commit. With similar stories making headlines across the nation, the   State Bar Association     formed a blue ribbon task force to study wrongful convictions. The group will make recommendations based on its findings. Bernice Leber, president of the   New York State Bar Association   , discussed the issue with WNED's Jay Moran.   To listen to the interview, please visit:   http://publicbroadcasting.net/wned/news.newsmain?action=article&ARTICLE_ID=1297833&sectionID=1   Editorial, Make DNA testing more available to   New York  inmates, Democrat and Chronicle  Provide more DNA testing for inmates in   New York      It's certainly welcome that the   New York State Bar Association     is investigating the growing number of wrongful criminal convictions in the state. But frankly, this page likes even more the approach to the problem being used by the district attorney's office in    Dallas    .   District Attorney Craig Watkins is using a $453,900 grant from the New York-based Justice, Equality, Human Dignity and Tolerance Foundation to pay for post-conviction DNA testing. With the help of law students, Watkins' office is reviewing hundreds of requests by inmates, including requests denied under the previous district attorney.   The grant also requires    Dallas    County      commissioners to fund the DA's office for two additional years. This attempt to free wrongly convicted people comes at a time when there is a proliferation of cases overturned by new DNA evidence nationwide. In    Texas    since 2001, DNA testing has cleared 33 people who spent a combined 427 years in prison.    Or consider that locally, DNA evidence was responsible for freeing Douglas Warney in 2006 from state prison where he was sentenced for his 1996 conviction of the murder of a    Rochester    man.    The Warney case, no doubt, helped persuade the New York Bar to study wrongful criminal convictions and propose solutions. A final report is expected to be issued by the bar in April 2009, but it shouldn't take another year to figure out the merit of programs like the one in    Dallas    .    The state Legislature should make available funds for district attorneys' offices such as    Monroe     's to help pay for DNA testing. It's bad enough that people are behind bars who shouldn't be there. Add to this travesty the fact that this predicament undermines confidence in the judicial system, and wrongful convictions become nothing short of a crisis.  ________________________________________________________________________    June 17, 2008   To right the wrongs, Newsday Group will study wrongful convictions   Wrongful convictions produce not only a nightmare for the person serving the time without having committed the crime, but a nest of problems for the rest of us. That includes the costs of the actual imprisonment, plus millions of dollars in damages that the state must pay exonerated inmates, and the sickening knowledge that the real perpetrators have been on the loose, probably committing other crimes. Now the new president of the   New York State Bar Association    , Bernice Leber, is doing something about it. She has appointed a task force to study cases of wrongful conviction, examine the faults in the criminal justice system that led to them, and recommend legislation to fix what's broken. The chairman of the task force will be Barry Kamins, immediate past president of the New York City Bar Association. Among others, it includes prosecutors, retired judges, law professors, and representatives of the Fortune Society, which helps inmates re-enter society, and the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City. This page has endorsed legislation sponsored by Assemb. Michael Gianaris (D-Astoria), setting up a permanent innocence commission to review the cases of exonerated inmates. That bill is still making its way through the State Legislature. Meanwhile, the state bar's task force will play a similar role, except on a temporary basis, and with no need for legislative action to get its work started. Leber wants the task force to finish by next April. That would allow time for the legislature to act next year on its recommendations. We hope the Gianaris bill will have passed by then, but if not, the report should give it a welcome boost. We need to examine faults in the criminal justice system. ________________________________________________________________________   July 3, 2008   Tankleff pushes for video recording of interrogations, Newsday By Zachary R. Dowdy   In his first public appearance since having murder charges dropped against him, Martin Tankleff said he was lucky to have his family, high-caliber attorneys on his side, and a public that supported him in his drive to overturn his conviction for the 1988 murders of his parents. "I was one of the fortunate ones," he said, testifying in upper    Manhattan     about his plight before a task force designed to explore criminal justice reforms. "I wrote over 50,000 letters. I was able to recruit the support of many, many lawyers and major law firms. There's too many men in prison who didn't get that luck." After Tankleff's address before the New York State Senate Democratic Task Force on Criminal Justice Reform, two state legislators, state Sen. Eric Schneiderman (D-Manhattan), the task force's chairman, and Assemb. Michael Gianaris (D-Astoria), apologized for the role the criminal justice system played in imprisoning Tankleff and for taking so long to reverse itself. "I cannot say enough how much all of us in public service and in government are really embarrassed and upset by what happened to you," Schneiderman said. "I'm sorry it took so long." He said the State Senate, through forums like the one Tankleff spoke at and the legislation it hopes to draft, will strive to put in place reforms that "could prevent this from happening again." Tankleff pushed for videotaped interrogations, saying a recording of his questioning by detectives would have documented his innocence. "Had my interrogation been recorded, I would not have served 6,338 days in prison," he said. Tankleff, who had been sentenced to 50 years to life in prison, said further, "There's no downside to recording. The truth gets exposed. ... Does 17 years of my life cost as much as it does to record interrogations? How many other men have to serve time in prison because somebody says it costs too much? I can record this entire event on my cell phone. It's ridiculous."Opponents of recording interrogations say defendants' rights are adequately protected already and that videotaping the process offers few benefits.    On Monday, state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo dropped murder charges against Tankleff, whose conviction for the Sept. 7, 1988, murders of his parents, Arlene and Seymour Tankleff, was overturned by a state appellate panel in December. Cuomo's office stepped in and began investigating the case anew after Suffolk District Attorney Thomas Spota said he would move to drop the charges. The event also featured testimony from Alan Netwon, who was convicted of a rape, spent 21 years in prison and was later exonerated, and legal experts such as   New York State Bar Association   President Bernice Leber and Barry Kamins, chair of the state bar's task force on wrongful convictions, which will examine 56 such convictions in    New York    State     . ________________________________________________________________________  Martin Tankleff and Other Exonerees and Legal Experts Testify at Senate Democratic Forum on Preventing Wrongful Convictions, News LI   (    New York   ,  NY    )  –    State Senators Eric Schneiderman (D-Manhattan/Bronx), Velmanette Montgomery (D-Brooklyn) and Bill Perkins (D-Manhattan), Assemblymembers Michael Gianaris (D-Queens), Adriano Espaillat (D-Manhattan), Rory Lancman (D-Queens) and Ellen Young (D-Queens), and leading criminal justice advocates took part in a public forum to address wrongful convictions and the creation of an independent “Innocence Commission” in New York State.      At the forum, testimony was presented by exonerees Martin Tankleff and Alan Newton, Steve Saloom of The Innocence Project, which is affiliated with the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, Bernice Leber, President of the   New York State Bar Association    , Barry Kamins, Chair of the NYS Bar Association’s Task Force on Wrongful Convictions, and Jonathan Gradess, Executive Director of the New York State Defenders Association.      Schneiderman, who chairs the New York State Senate Democratic Task Force on Criminal Justice Reform and also serves as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Codes Committee and as a Commissioner on the New York State Commission on Sentencing Reform, has worked to ensure that the guilty are punished and innocent persons are (safeguarded). Testimony from today’s forum will be used to develop legislation that ensures the public’s trust in    New York     ’s criminal justice system.   “No one who is entrusted with ensuring the integrity of our criminal justice process—and most importantly the legislators who make our laws—can, in good conscience, ignore the prevalence of wrongful convictions in our state,” Senator Schneiderman said.  “There are known flaws in the system, with eyewitness identification, interrogations, and preservation of and post-conviction access to DNA, that we can and should remedy.  There are also contributing factors that we don’t understand, and we have a responsibility to identify and remedy those as well.”   Testifying today about the need for reform in our criminal justice system was Martin Tankleff, who was convicted and sentenced to 50-years-to-life after allegedly confessing to his parents’ double-homicide. Last year, after serving over 17 years in prison, the New York State Appellate Court 2nd Department unanimously overturned his conviction.  On Monday, the office of New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo vacated his indictments and decided not to retry Mr. Tankleff.      “I clearly do not want another person to experience what I have been experiencing for nearly twenty years,” said Mr. Tankleff.  “The larger meaning of my case is to point out the gaps in our system, which is that when there is a horrible, obvious mistake made, there is no mechanism for correcting it. To leave it to the judicial and prosecutorial entities to correct their own mistakes is what leads the wrongfully convicted, like myself, to remain imprisoned for many, many years.”   Steve Saloom, Policy Director at The Innocence Project, indicated that the circumstances in the Tankleff case were not unique.  The Innocence Project has helped to exonerate 215 individuals in the    United States    since 1989. According to Saloom, “Twenty-three people in    New York    served years or decades in prison before DNA proved their innocence, more than almost any other state in the nation. Nobody – not the police, prosecutors, judges, victims, or the public at large – benefits from these wrongful convictions.  The only person who benefits is the real perpetrator of a crime, who eludes justice.  In order to restore public faith in the justice system, it is critically important that we learn from each wrongful conviction by examining their causes and understanding the reforms that can prevent them. We applaud the   New York Bar Association    for taking the first steps towards doing so and we commend Senator Schneiderman for convening this Task Force to understand how the legislature can best act to prevent wrongful convictions.”   Saloom and others spoke about the need for an independent innocence commission as a tool for addressing wrongful convictions in the state. For several years, and without success, the state legislature has sought to establish an innocence commission empowered to evaluate the lessons of these exonerations. Such a commission would examine each case, with a specific eye towards what investigative and court processes – and what prosecutorial and defense shortcomings—contributed to those wrongful convictions.   Such a commission would make recommendations to adopt reforms that increase the accuracy of criminal investigations, strengthen prosecutions, and protect the innocent.  Many other states have learned from wrongful convictions in this manner; they have researched cases and potential reforms, heard testimony from experts, and issued reports and recommendations on issues including eyewitness identifications, false confessions, and forensic laboratory oversight.      The   New York State Bar Association   recently created a task force of criminal justice experts from across the state’s criminal justice system that will review the state’s wrongful convictions, seek to understand their causes, and issue recommendations to improve the accuracy of    New York    ’s criminal justice system.  This NYSBA task force has great potential to inform policymakers about the reforms    New York    needs to adopt in order to further enhance the quality of justice across our state. Legislation has been introduced in    Albany     to permanently establish and fund such a commission.      “Fundamentally, we became lawyers and public servants to help others,” testified Bernice Leber, President of the   New York State Bar Association    . “I can think of no worse fear than being imprisoned – even for one day – for a crime that one did not commit.”   “The Bar Association’s Task Force has identified 56 cases in New York where a convicted defendant was later exonerated, either by the use of DNA testing or based on non-DNA methods, and we plan to review each of those cases and produce a report by January 2009,” said Barry Kamins, Chair of the recently established Bar Association Task Force on Wrongful Convictions.      State Senator Velmanette Montgomery, a long time advocate for reforming criminal justice policies in New York, continued “The hundreds of exonerations across the nation over the past several years should inspire us to fix the cracks in our criminal justice system.  By examining current exonerations and recommending ways to reform our criminal justice procedures, an independent commission will act as a guide to ensure that our criminal justice system is working properly, and that we are only convicting the real perpetrator of a crime.”   State Senator Bill Perkins agreed with his colleagues and added, “The   Central Park     Five are perfect examples of how innocent individuals can be wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit.  Frighteningly, if this case had warranted the death penalty, then these young men would have had their lives ended because our system failed them.”   “Just as we study the causes of wrongful deaths, our criminal justice system needs an autopsy to determine how to prevent even more innocent people from being imprisoned,” said Assemblyman Michael Gianaris (D-Queens), who is the author of legislation to establish an Innocence Commission in    New York     (Assembly Bill A4317). “One innocent person spending years in prison for crimes he or she did not commit is one too many. Unfortunately, recent history proves that the problem is more widespread than anyone would like to admit. This is a systemic problem that requires a systemic solution. ” ________________________________________________________________________   September 12, 2008   Respected criminal law maven Kamins newly sworn in to serve in  Manhattan ,  NY Daily News By Nancie L. Katz A prominent   Brooklyn   criminal defense lawyer - who counts corrupt judges among his clients - was sworn onto the   Manhattan   bench Thursday.  "I've been an advocate a long time. I'm looking forward to the legal issues," said   Barry Kamins   , 64. "There's a certain excitement about being on the bench."  Kamins, former chairman of the   New York City Bar Association   and author of a definitive book on search and seizure, was appointed by   Mayor Bloomberg   's Advisory   Committee on the Judiciary   .   He began his career as a   Brooklyn   assistant district attorney and went into private practice in 1973.    Since then, he has built a name as the go-to guy in Brooklyn and    Manhattan    for legal ethical questions. When a judge gets in trouble, he calls Kamins.    Kings County    lawyers called Kamins the "dean" of the   Brooklyn   legal community.   "You know how you say 'Michael' and everyone knows you're referring to   Michael Jordan   ?" asked   James Koenig   , chairman  of the   Kings County Criminal Bar Association    . "It's almost in   Brooklyn   , like that with Barry. Barry is Barry. There's a lot of Barrys out there, but there's only one Barry."   Koenig said Kamins has advised "several generations of lawyers. If you have an issue, you go to Barry. It's really terrific that someone of this stature becomes a judge."   Kamins also is chairman of the    New York State Bar Association    Task Force on Wrongful Convictions, and co-chairman of the chief judge's advisory committee on criminal law.    His name has woven in and out of   Brooklyn   's judicial scandals. Soon after convicted    Democratic Party Chairman Clarence Norman   was probed for selling judgeships, Kamins resigned from his panel for screening potential jurists.  When former   Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Victor Barron   pleaded guilty to soliciting $250,000 from a lawyer in exchange for approving a $4 million personal injury settlement, Kamins - sporting a characteristic bow tie - was there to represent him.  He also was the first attorney called by bribery   Judge Gerald Garson   when he was arrested in March 2003. Garson is serving three years for fixing divorce cases in exchange for cash, cigars, drinks and dinners from a crooked lawyer.  Kamins also is known for representing lawyers probed by the Appellate Division's disciplinary committee.  Among them is   Louis Rosenthal    , former counsel to the   Brooklyn   public administrator, who took more than $2 million in excessive fees, according to the state Court of Appeals.   Kamins' firm also welcomed former Brooklyn Justice Edward Rappaport, who was refused permission to stay on the bench after the age of 70 by a court administrative board.  * Similar stories appeared in the NY Law Journal and Brooklyn Daily Eagle               About NYSBA |  For the Media |  Resources for Local Bars |  Law, Youth and Citizenship |  Contact Us |  Site Map    NEW YORK STATE BAR ASSOCIATION, ONE ELK STREET, ALBANY, NY 12207   PH: (518) 463-3200   FX: (518) 487-5517 Copyright © New York State Bar Association, 2008 Privacy Statement |  Terms of Use
