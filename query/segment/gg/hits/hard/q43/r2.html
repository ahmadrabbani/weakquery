                               Nicarico, 10, was abducted from her home in Illinois
                               and found dead two days later. This traces the
                               ordeal of Rolando Cruz and Alex Hernandez, who
                               were charged with the crime. A circumstantial
                               case against them led one investigator to resign
                               they were found guilty and sentenced to die. Cruz
                               talks about his decade-long battle from death
