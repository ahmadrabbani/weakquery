Its mission was simple and, one would have thought, inoffensive: People were being convicted by American courts and then conclusively proved innocent. Some lost years or even decades of their lives. Some were Pennsylvanians. If this outrage could be fixed, the advisory committee was tasked to find out how. I was delighted to be an inaugural member.  As an attorney with 30 years of criminal law experience, I knew that this was important work, and I expected it to be noncontroversial, unlike many of my other professional duties. After all, hundreds of people nationwide had been cleared by DNA analysis after being convicted of terrible crimes.  Guilty verdicts were returned by conscientious juries, reviewed by experienced judges, affirmed by competent courts, and yet we now know that many of those convicted are really innocent. “Innocent” in the sense that they didn’t do “it” — whatever the particular “it” of their particular tragedy might have been. Who could object to trying to eliminate false convictions? What could be worse than taking innocent citizens, ruining their lives and throwing them in prison for crimes they didn’t do?  I was sure that this work would get unanimous support. That was a huge mistake. Before our committee could even sit down for its first meeting, the president of the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association wrote a newspaper column complaining about our composition and predicting our failure.  Why? Because we had too many lawyers, scholars, scientists and civic leaders on the roster and not enough prosecutors. We were, he felt, too opinionated to be balanced.  I hoped he was right. Convicting the innocent means the victory of injustice and the failure of truth. Every decent person should oppose it and none should be balanced, unbiased or impartial about it. No one has ever explained to me why we should balance the search for justice with an equally vigorous search for additional injustice.  Why should we balance our efforts to fix the legal system’s problems with an impartial struggle to preserve them?  And so for the last four years, the advisory committee has studied why innocent men and women are falsely convicted and condemned. We have heard from some of America’s leading scientists. We have learned what other states have done to solve this problem. We found out that nearly all wrong convictions can be traced to mistaken eyewitnesses, false confessions, junk science, dishonest informants, incompetent defense lawyers and official misconduct.  And we discovered that those causes are relatively easy to fix. Some of the fixes carry modest price tags, others cost nothing. But all of them require us to admit our past mistakes and to acknowledge that the way things have always been done is not necessarily the best way to do them. Change can be disquieting.  So after our official report was released on Sept. 20, I was disappointed but not surprised to find out that a minority group of prosecution and police members had drafted their own unauthorized rebuttal. For 83 pages, they malign the hard work of the majority (claiming we had a preordained, criminal defense agenda), they make light of the discoveries of some of America’s most brilliant scientists (preferring “common sense” and “collective wisdom”), they dispute the infallibilty of DNA evidence when it proves innocence (but not when it confirms guilt), they denigrate the judgment of courts when they exculpate the accused (but not when they convict them), and they doubt that exonerated prisoners are truly innocent — often rehashing the discredited evidence that caused the false conviction in the first place.     Spero Lappas           In an orchestrated news release, the current president of the District Attorneys Association picked up the baton of his predecessor, declaring that our recommendations “have the potential to create roadblocks to justice.” Meanwhile, the minority protests that their views did not gain traction during the years when the committee worked diligently to complete a serious mission.  Respect for criminal justice rests largely on community belief that the system tells the truth. Notwithstanding the protests and self-congratulation of the minority report, no one can legitimately claim that our system is perfect. If it was, we would have no bad convictions.  Because it isn’t, we should work together to make it better. Now that the prosecutors have had their say, I encourage their community to stop haggling for the moral high ground and remember that every single wrongful conviction began as one of their misguided prosecutions.

He became a wealthy man defending the dregs of society, and he approached his duties on the commision as a defense attorney. His statement that "many of those convicted are really innocent" is nonsense. The percentage of inmates "cleared" after conviction is less than 1/1000 of 1%. That statement alone makes it clear that Lappas has little interest in justice. Justice, according to Lappas, means 30 years of appeals for a condemned murderer, while the family suffers. Now his little commision would handcuff police and prosecutors, hand still more rights to criminals, and further victimize crime victims. If anything, the second report didn't go nearly far enough in criticizing this politically motivated sham.  Inappropriate?  Alert us.

After you're finished licking boots, do you care to make a wager on that statement? I'll give you 100-1 that the percentage of wrongful convictions is much larger than that.

These two concepts are just two of the several things that have the Judicial System of the United States the greatest judicial system in the world. Inappropriate?  Alert us.
