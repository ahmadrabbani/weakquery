<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
report by University of Michigan staffers and law students –
<i>Exonerations in the United
States: 1989 through 2003</i> –
was released to the public on April 23, 2004. The report analyzed
data from 328 cases during that 15 year period in which the defendant
was officially declared, “not guilty of a crime for which he or
she had previously been convicted.”</font></font></font></p>
<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">

<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
report concentrated on rape and murder convictions, since 319 of the
328 cases studied involved a defendant convicted of one or both those
crimes. One of two areas the researchers focused on, was how often
several factors known to contribute to a wrongful conviction -
eyewitness misidentification, perjury and a false confession - were
present in those cases. It was found that 64% of the people
exonerated of rape and/or murder had been misidentified, 15% had
falsely confessed, and a prosecution witness had committed perjury in
44% of the cases. </font></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western"

</p>
<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
other area reported on is how race relates to exonerations. It was
found that people of various races are exonerated at about the same
rate as they are convicted – unless the person was under 18 at
the time of arrest. Almost eight times as many blacks wrongly
convicted of a crime as a juvenile are exonerated than are whites
(77% to 10%). That finding is consistent with the phenomena of
erroneous cross-racial identifications, since many of those cases
involved the ID of a black person by a white.</font></font></font></p>

<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">So
in general the report's findings tend to be a fine tuning of what is
already known about wrongful convictions. However there is one area
where the report engages in speculation, and that is about how many
non-death row exonerations there would have been if all cases “were
reviewed with the same level of care that we devote to death
sentences.” That figure is estimated by the report to be 28,642
cases, and it refers to that as “a shocking prospect.”
While appearing numerically impressive, the report’s estimate
actually downplays the number of people that knowledgeable observers
over the past four decades have estimated are wrongly convicted.
Furthermore it doesn't just do so by a small number, but very
significantly.</font></font></font></p>

<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
judge interviewed for <i>The
Innocents</i>, a 1964 book by
investigative reporter Edward Radin, estimated that 5% of everyone
convicted of a crime is innocent. The judge indicated that to
maintain public support for the legal system, the appearance has to
be maintained that it is fair by accurately distinguishing the
innocent from the guilty.</font></font></font></p>

<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In
<i>Presumed Guilty</i>
(1992), Rev. James McCloskey (the founder of
Centurion Ministries, which is dedicated to freeing wrongly convicted
people) is credited with estimating “10% of the people
convicted of serious crimes each year are innocent.”</font></font></font></p>
<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
</p>
<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In
<i>Convicted But Innocent</i>
(1996), the authors conservatively
estimate that 2% of everyone convicted of an offense included in the
FBI's Uniform Crime Report is innocent. However, they also reported
that judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys who completed a
questionnaire think the number of wrongly convicted people exceeds
5%.</font></font></font></p>
<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
</p>
<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In
January 2000, this author's estimate that 14% of convictions are of
an innocent person was published in <i>Justice:Denied</i>
magazine.</font></font></font></p>
<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
</p>
<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Furthermore
it was reported in 1997 that the FBI found that 25% of the suspects
in 12,000 rape cases were excluded by DNA testing. That finding is
particularly significant because exclusionary DNA evidence is only
available in a small percentage of all criminal cases.</font></font></font></p>
<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">So
from 1964 to 2000 knowledgeable estimates of the number of wrongly
convicted people range from 2% to 14%, and the finding of the FBI –
an agency of the U.S. Department of Justice – lends empirical
support to the higher figure.</font></font></font></p>
<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Based on the most current Bureau of Justice Statistics data, it is estimated that from 1989 to
2003 there were 14,295,000 felony convictions in state and federal
courts. So the report's estimate that there should have been 28,642
exonerations from 1989 to 2003</font></font></font><FONT 
color=#000000><FONT face="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT size=3>amounts to 
2/10th&nbsp;of 1%, or .2% of the felony convictions during those 15 years. 
</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT color=#000000><FONT 
face="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT size=3>Furthermore, the report's estimate 
amounts to a projected 1,909 exonerations a year out of 953,000 convictions – or 
1 out of 500.</FONT></FONT></FONT></p>
<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
Supreme Court inferred in <i>Schlupv.
Delo</i>, 115 S. Ct. 115 (1995)
that the legal system may only need to ascertain guilt to an accuracy
rate of 99% (99 out of 100). Thus the reports contention that 499 out
of 500 convictions are of a guilty person provides powerful support
to the contention that while not 100% perfect, the United States has
a discerning legal system. Hence if the report’s estimate of
wrongful convictions is to be believed, then this countries legal
system is neither broken nor in need of significant reforms. After
all, the average new car has an average of over one significant
problem within 90 days of its purchase, so with a correct conviction
rate of 99.8%, car manufacturers ought to be consulting with judges
and prosecutors on how to manufacture a more reliable product.
Consequently the report plays directly into the hands of prosecutors,
judges, police and corrections officials who contend the system works
remarkably well at weeding out the innocent from the guilty. </font></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">However
that assessment stands in stark contrast with the much different
conclusion that can be drawn from the estimates of wrongful
convictions from 1964 to 2000, the lowest of which extrapolates to an
average of over 19,000 cases during each of the 15 years covered by
the report. Solid support for the pervasiveness of wrongful
convictions indicated by those numerous estimates is provided by the
findings of a study published in June 2000. That study - <i>A
Broken
System: Error Rates in Capital Cases</i>
– found that 68% of
the 4,578 capital cases finalized from 1973 to 1995 was reversed on
appeal; that “7% of capital cases nationwide are reversed
because the condemned person was found to be innocent;” and
that on retrial, the defendant was given a lesser sentence in 82% of
those reversed cases. So based on the findings of that extensive
multi-year study that was overseen by the esteemed Professor James
Liebman (co-author of <i>Federal
Habeas Corpus Practice and
Procedure</i>), if every one of the
14,295,000 criminal conviction in
this country from 1989 through 2003 had been subjected to the same
degree of appellate review as is a capital case, then 9,720,600 of
those cases (68%) would have been reversed, with the result that
680,442 of the defendants (7%) would have been exonerated, and
7,970,892 of the defendants (82%) would have been re-sentenced to a
lesser punishment.</font></font></font></p>
<p class="western"
 style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 106%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Consequently,
the findings reported in <i>A
Broken System</i> (and its follow-up
report, <i>A Broken System</i><b>,</b>
Part II, February 2002) are
consistent with the estimates from 1964 to 2000 that there are
serious systemic errors in the ability of this country’s legal
system to accurately distinguish the innocent from the guilty.</font></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 110%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">So
while the analysis of various factors related to wrongful convictions
in the April 2004 report is valuable information, its attempt to
downplay the incidence of the phenomena must be taken with a grain of
salt.</font></font></font></p>
