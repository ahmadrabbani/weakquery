 Female Nobel Prize Laureates

 Female Nobel Prize Laureates brought to you by  The Nobel Prize Internet Archive        In 1903, only two years after the Nobel Foundation was established, a Nobel Prize was awarded to a woman,  Marie Curie , for the first time. Women have been winning Nobel Prizes ever since, but in very small numbers compared to their male colleagues. It took 40 years from its inception for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences to be awarded to a woman,  Elinor Ostrom . This is despite the fact that one woman,  Bertha von Suttner was influential in convincing Alfred Nobel to establish a Prize for Peace.
