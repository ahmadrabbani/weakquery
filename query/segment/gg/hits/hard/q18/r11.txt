Don't try if you really, really need the loo (just one of the findings at the pointless science awards)   By  Rob Waugh  Last updated at 2:08 PM on 30th September 2011       Comments ( 9 )      Add to My Stories      Share     The Ig Nobel prizes have all the trappings of a real scientific awards ceremony - they're held at Harvard University in America, and the prizes are handed out by real Nobel winners.  But the alarm bells start to wring when you realise they are handed out by the Annals of Improbable Research - and intended to 'honour' the most surreal scientific research on the planet.    This year's ceremony, the 21st, awarded prizes to projects including a study of yawning in tortoises - and a study of how human behaviour was changed when we really, really need the toilet.    Solving a jimmy riddle: Mirjam Tuk, left, gives the acceptance speech after receiving the Ig Nobel prize in Medicine for research into what happens to decision-making while people really need the toilet   Peter Snyder and his colleagues found that having a bladder at its bursting point reduced attention span and the ability to make decisions to the same degree expected with low levels of alcohol intoxication or 24 hours of sleep deprivation.    The research earned them the 2011 Ig Nobel prize for medicine. You do have to really, really need for it to make a big difference, however.    'When people reach a point when they are in so much pain they just can’t stand it anymore, it was like being drunk,' said Snyder, a professor of neurology at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island who conducted with research with colleagues including Dr Mirjam Tuk.  'The ability to hold information was really impaired,' he said.  A 2011 Ig Nobel Prize is shown during the 21st annual Ig Nobel prize ceremony at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts   Other winners included a study into beetles who became so enamoured with beer bottles they died trying to mate with them. The beetles were, of course, Australian.   The males in question, Australian jewel beetles (Julodimorpha bakewelli), become so enamored with brown 'stubby' beer bottles that they 'mate' with them so vigorously they die in the hot sun, says Professor Darryl Gwynne, an international expert in behavioural ecology.  Gwynne and his Australian colleague David Rentz, who won the biology prize, wrote the paper 'Beetles on the Bottle: Male Buprestids Mistake Stubbies for Females,' in 1983.    'I'm honoured, I think,' Gwynne said, with a smile on his face. 'The awards make people think, and they're a bit of a laugh. Really, we've been sitting here by the phone for the past 20 plus years waiting for the call. Why did it take them so long?'   Daryll Gwynne, center, accepts the Ig Nobel prize for a study of why male beetles kill themselves attempting to mate with beer bottles  The Ig Nobel Prizes, a parody of the Nobel Prizes, are awarded annually by the scientific humour magazine Annals of Improbable Research to 'first make people laugh and then make them think'.  The prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual, honour the imaginative and spur people's interest in science, medicine and technology.    A chemist is reflected in a beaker after mixing chemicals that gave the beaker a reflective coating at this year's Ig Nobels   2011: THIS YEAR'S BEST  IG NOBEL WINNERS     PHYSIOLOGY   : 'No Evidence of Contagious Yawning in the Red-Footed Tortoise.'   CHEMISTRY:  A study on  the effects of holding in urine.   PSYCHOLOGY:  A study on why people sigh.         PHYSICS: A study of why discus throwers become dizzy, and why hammer throwers don’t.   MATHEMATICS:  Assorted doomsday predictors throughout history for teaching the world to be careful when making mathematical assumptions and calculations.     PUBLIC SAFETY:  John Senders for his experiments in which a driver on a major highway repeatedly has a visor flapped down over his face.    Gwynne and Rentz were conducting field work in Western Australia 23 years ago when they noticed something unusual.    'We were walking along a dirt road with the usual scattering of beer cans and bottles when we saw about six bottles with beetles on top or crawling up the side. It was clear the beetles were trying to mate with the bottles.'  The bottles – stubbies as they are known in Australia – resemble a female jewel beetle, Gwynne said. They are big and orangey brown in colour, with a slightly dimpled surface near the bottom (designed to prevent the bottle from slipping out of one's grasp) that reflects light in much the same way as female wing covers.    The bottles proved irresistible to males. Ignoring the females, the males mounted or tried to climb up the bottles, refusing to leave.    They fried to death in the sun, were eaten by hungry ants or had to be physically removed by the researchers.   The alcohol content, though, wasn't the attraction for the tiny Australians.    Wwynne and Rentz determined that the males were attracted only to stubbies – not to beer cans or wine bottles of a slightly different shade of brown.    'Not only do western Australians never dispose of a beer bottle with beer still in it, but many of the bottles had sand and detritus accumulated over many months,' the research paper notes.   There was, Gwynne claims, a serious point.   F  irst, when humans interfere – perhaps unwittingly – in an evolutionary process, there can be unintended consequences; in this case, female beetles are ignored by males which can have a huge impact on the natural world. To that end, Gwynne forwarded research results to a leading western Australian brewer.   And secondly, Gwynne points out that the research supports the theory of sexual selection, that males, in their eagerness to mate, are the ones that make mistakes.       Print this article   Read later   Email to a friend   Share this article:   Facebook    Twitter    Digg it    Newsvine    Delicious    MySpace    Nowpublic    Reddit             Comments ( 9 )  Here's what readers have had to say so far.
