In case you didn't know, Energy Secretary Stephen Chu is the other Obama administration person with a Nobel prize. Not for Peace. That award went to the president who ordered two Afghanistan troop surges and the interminable air assault on Libya that took months, not days. Despite his prize, Chu is under House interrogation for the disastrous federal loan backing to would-be-but-now-wouldn't-you-know-it-bankrupt-solar-panel maker Solyndra. That idea was going to create so many promised green jobs that Vice President Joe "We'll Have Hundreds of Thousands of New Jobs Any Month Now" Biden cut the ribbon electronically at the Solyndra loan-signing.  Now that gaffe will merely cost American taxpayers a half-billion dollars or so. Some people, who do not have Nobel prizes, suspect that the Obama Chicago administration arranged the lost loan at no cost to them to help Solyndra's top investor, George Kaiser. If you can imagine such a coincidence, Kaiser was also one of Obama's top fundraising bundlers last campaign. Or, rather, during the earlier part of the unending Obama campaign. In a shocking statement to a House committee hearing today, Chu denied any political favoritism. Chu was asked if he knew of George Kaiser. "I know now," he replied.  That's a cute answer to have in the hearing transcript. It implies Chu didn't know of Kaiser during the hasty loan approval. But it doesn't actually say he didn't know. Remember, oaths, perjury, all those things. How much of this God-awful sum will taxpayers get back? "That remains to be seen." It turns out there are  emails stating that administration folks exerted heavy pressure a year ago to delay Solyndra's alarming layoff notices until Nov. 3. Coincidentally, the midterm elections were scheduled for Nov. 2. The results that day were awful for Democrats, so awful that this Chu House hearing would never have happened without the new Republican majority. And those results might have been awfuler with that pink slip news.  What was that Nov. 3 pressure about anyway? "I don't know," says Chu, who is allegedly in charge of the entire Energy Dept., one of those bureaucratic entities that a President Perry now remembers he would erase. Did the White House pressure Energy to grant the loan to its money buddy George? "We did not communicate with the White House on whether we should approve a loan, and especially the Solyndra loan." Another cute construction. First, a straight answer would have been "Yes" or "No."  Full Page  « « First  « Previous  Page:  1  2   Next »  Last » »        Twitter:  @AHMalcolm Facebook:  Andrew Malcolm    More:  Solyndra      Avg.

Kudos to you, Mr. Malcolm, for an excellent column.    Posted By: RickyRight(5) on 11/18/2011 | 1:10 AM ET  Mr.Malcom,thanks for the concise,unvarnished truth.Those wannabe journalists out there would do well to follow your example.Sadly,most of them are just tools to be used then discarded by the democrat plantation Overseers.
