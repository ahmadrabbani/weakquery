It’s also an excellent way to highlight brand values, build reputation, profile brand personality and contribute towards the achievement of national priorities.    Ensuring that children can survive, thrive and fulfil their potential is, above all, a moral imperative. Investing in children’s development also yields positive benefits to families, communities, societies and economies - and is one of best and most valuable long-term investments we can make.   Poverty reduction starts with children.  Achieve results for South Africa’s children  Through UNICEF’s partnership with government - and our work with many organisations - sustainable solutions are in sight for serious issues affecting children.  Your company’s support will help accelerate the pace of progress towards reaching these and other key goals:  Increased access to Early Childhood Development (ECD) services - because today, less than half of South Africa’s young children are exposed to these critical interventions, essential for their development and school readiness.  A strengthened child protection system and scaled up prevention and victim support measures - because more than 56 000 children were reported to be victims of violent crime in 2009/2010.  Fewer preventable child deaths and improved quality of maternal and child healthcare - because almost 40% of under-five deaths in South Africa occur in the neonatal period (first 28 days of life).  Quality teaching and learning - because an evaluation of Grade 3 learners in 2011 found low-average scores of 35% in literacy and 28% in numeracy tests.
