          <p class="Text"><font size="2" face="Arial">Speaking before the
          National Summit on Africa held in Washington, DC on February 19th and
          20th, Denver Mayor and Conference of Mayors President Wellington E.
          Webb called for the implementation of a ten-point plan of action to
          address the economic and social inequities facing the peoples and
          nations of Africa. The centerpiece of the plan is a proposal for a $5
          billion aid program for Africa which includes funds for economic aid,
          human resource development, and resources to combat the AIDS pandemic
          which is devastating the African continent. Such levels of aid, if
          approved by Congress and the Administration, would be unprecedented,
          and would, according to figures reported by the Africa fund, increase
          the level of U. S. aid to sub-Saharan Africa by sevenfold.</font></p>
          <p class="Text"><font size="2" face="Arial">Why do this? Why
          Africa? Mayor Webb said. The United States has been very active
          in stimulating trade in Russia, Eastern Europe, the Pacific Rim, Latin
          America, and Mexico and Canada through NAFTA, the North America Free
          Trade Agreement; it is time to extend those same initiatives to
          Africa.</font></p>
          <p class="Text"><font size="2" face="Arial">Webb made his appeal last
          night while delivering the closing keynote address at the closing
          ceremonies of National Summit on Africa, held at the Kennedy Center.
          The Summit brought together 5,000 people here to discuss Africa and
          race in America, and hopes to become a strong lobby for African issues
          in the United States.</font></p>
          <p class="Text"><font size="2" face="Arial">The United States is
          the most logical nation to lead international efforts to assist
          Africas economic endeavors. Our thriving economy provides a
          tremendous resource base for economic investment and technical
          assistance, Mayor Webb said. Its diverse population is composed
          of a substantial number of citizens of African descent, and its
          history of being a melting pot of all peoples provides fertile ground
          for the idea of substantial investment in Africa. If not, the U. S.,
          then who? Mayor Webb asked. If not the large African American
          population in the U.S. then who?<o:p>

          </font></p>
          <p class="Text"><font size="2" face="Arial">Webb was also on hand for
          a special awards luncheon held on February 19th, where he received an
          award for his pivotal role in helping to raise the profile of the
          National Summit. Last September, as part of the National Summit on
          Africa, the City of Denver hosted one of four regional conferences on
          Africa at the Colorado Convention Center.<o:p>

          <p class="Text"><font size="2" face="Arial">Mayor Webb is an
          internationally recognized leader on issues relating to Africa. He
          created The U.S. Conference of Mayors Task Force on Sub-Saharan Africa
          and was one of two locally elected officials invited to participate by
          President Clinton to participate in an historic mission to Africa in
          1998. Last spring, Mayor Webb led a delegation of U.S. Mayors to Ghana
          to participate in the African/African American Summit. Mayor Webb has
          also visited Axum, Ethiopia, one of Denvers Sister Cities.<o:p>

          <p class="Text"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Other key policy
          elements of Mayor Webbs agenda for Africa include:</b></font></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p class="bullettext"><font size="2" face="Arial">Payment of back
              dues owed by the United States to the United Nations, and
              significant U. S. contribution to peacekeeping efforts in Sierra
              Leone and The Congo Republic;</font></li>
            <li>
              <p class="bullettext"><font size="2" face="Arial">Debt relief for

          </ul>
          <p class="Text"><font size="2" face="Arial">Cultural elements of the
          plan include fostering sister-city and other cultural exchanges
          between African and American cities; supporting organizations such as
          the National Summit on Africa; and teaching the nations children
          about Africas economic and cultural contributions to the world.</font></p>

          is a four-year initiative established to achieve three key goals: to
          educate the American public about Africa and about U.S.- Africa
          relations; to broaden and strengthen the network of Africas
          supporters in the U.S., and to develop a policy plan of action to
          guide U.S. relations with the countries and peoples of Africa.<o:p>
