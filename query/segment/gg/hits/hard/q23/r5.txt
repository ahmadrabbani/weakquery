Part 1 of 2: Beyond lost hope By  Carol Eustice , About.com Guide Updated February 26, 2007 About.com Health's Disease and Condition content is reviewed by the  Medical Review Board   See More About: mercy killing  dr. jack kevorkian        This article is part of the  Arthritis Archives.  Dateline: March 10, 1998   Mercy Killing or Suicide? The body of a 61-year-old woman from Roanoke, Virginia was dropped off at a hospital by Dr. Jack Kevorkian and an associate on Thursday March 5, 1998. A note with the body indicated that the woman suffered from  rheumatoid arthritis. Just a few hours earlier Kevorkian dropped off the body of a 42-year-old Boston man at a different hospital. A note with the man's body indicated he suffered from  fibromyalgia. Both rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia are painful, but    nonterminal  disorders. Dr. Kevorkian has admitted to taking part in more than 80 suicides over the years. Physician assisted suicide has been controversial throughout the span of time whilst Kevorkian has helped patients end their lives. Kevorkian has found supporters among people against the long-suffering of the terminally ill. He has found understanding and empathy among people experiencing:  unbearable pain physical discomfort loss of quality of life  He has found allies among the families of terminally ill patients and among pro-choice advocates. Yet he has been denounced by people against his role in assisted suicide and against its legalization. People feeling strongly that there are alternative options to assisted suicide have openly argued against Kevorkian's activities. So far states, prosecutors, juries, and the highest courts have not stopped him. In view of the most recent news and two previous similar incidents, Kevorkian seemingly has expanded the criteria of who he is willing to help terminate their life to include nonfatal illnesses. Shock waves rippled through rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia patients as they realized last week that two fellow sufferers lost all sight of hope and chose to end their life. Though certainly the  frustration and complete energy drain felt by chronic pain sufferers is corroborated, what might have lead these two people to believe that their suffering was beyond help and beyond all hope?  Beyond All Hope? The most vital consideration for chronic pain sufferers is how best to  manage their pain. The limitation, imposition, and interference that severe pain places on  daily living is what the chronic pain sufferer must confront and conquer. The sufferer requires support from an array of sources:  pain management psychological support family support economical support  These actions are all necessary. Presumably there is failure at each level of needed support for a person to feel that their situation is hopeless.  Patients look to their physicians for help with controlling pain. The undertreatment of chronic pain has become a genuine concern. Physicians have been accused of withholding  narcotics for pain treatment for reasons such as fear of patient addiction and fear of lawsuits. A solution must be found among all the treatment options so that a patient never is left to feel hopeless from uncontrolled pain. If a patient is unsatisfied with his physician's treatment plan he should continue his journey from doctor to doctor in search of relief.
