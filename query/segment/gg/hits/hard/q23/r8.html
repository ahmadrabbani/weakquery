<h1><small>Mercy Killing - Pros and Cons:<br>
Right to Live or Right to Die?</small></h1>
<p>Are you "<em>pro-life</em>," "<em>pro-death</em>" or just not sure? Who<br>
    should decide one's "right to life" or "right to death?"</p>

<h3><font color=red>When Life Becomes an Inconvenience</font></h3>
<p>Copyright Â© 2005 <a href="http://www.olivetreeviews.org"
 target=_blank>Jan Markell</a></p>

<p>I have a built-in radar system that registers a
 warning when it comes to "<em>mercy killing</em>." My Jewish
 grandparents fled a section of Russia about ten years
 before Hitler came to power as they sensed trouble
 was in the wind. This heritage actually caused me to
 research the Holocaust and write a best-selling book
 about it, "Trapped in Hitler's Hell" available
 through my Web site or print newsletter.</p>

<p>In October, 1939, Hitler ordered "mercy killing" of
 the sick and disabled, mainly children. The sentiment
 was to eliminate "life unworthy of life"--kids who
 would become an inconvenience if they lived. The
 deaths would soon include adults who were also
 inferior, feeble, or just too much trouble.</p>

<p>The Nazis made decisions without diagnoses or medical
 records.  They were a part of a barbaric system, and
 yet when the death camps were finally liberated, many
 felt that such atrocities were finally thrown on the
 ash heap of history.  They don't understand human
 nature or the Bible: Only when Satan is cast into the
 pit will evil end.  In the meantime people who stand
 for righteousness are doing all we can to check it.</p>

<p>No, America isn't Nazi Germany!  Yet what is
 happening here makes me very uncomfortable. Terri
 Schiavo wants to live. Her parents want to take care
 of her. But Terri is an inconvenience to her husband
 and "the system" has favored him thus far. But <em>this
 battle isn't just for Terri. It's a battle to stop
 America from going further down a slippery slope
 that disregards human life</em>.</p>

<p>If America's leaders, doctors, lawyers, and judges
 allow her to die in the terrible "prescribed manner"
 - by starvation and dehydration - have we sunk to
 the level of barbarians?</p>

<p>Terrorists have gotten better treatment and a greater
 outcry than Terri.  Two terrorists killed over 240
 people in Africa in 1998.  They were brought to
 America for trial and after seven months of court
 pleading, their lives were spared in spite of the
 fact that they had been planning to destroy us
 indiscriminately.</p>

<p>Timothy McVeigh was a co-conspirator in the Oklahoma
 City bombing of 1995.  He was given a quick, painless,
 lethal injection that brought almost instant, peaceful
 death.</p>

<p>Criminals and terrorists at Abu Grhaib prison were
 humiliated by a few bad apples in the U.S. military
 and the world collectively excoriated America at the
 inhumane abuse of these men.</p>

<p>Civil liberties' activists are characteristically
 set into hysteria the moment an al-Qaida terrorist
 is rumored to have been sent to bed without dinner.

<p>Do you get the point?</p>

<p>If Terri Schiavo is executed -- and yes, that is a
 proper word -- next week or next year, how much
 better are we than the savages we are fighting in the
 war on terror?</p>

<p>If America and the world have pity and mercy on thugs
 and terrorists and not on a defenseless woman who has
 not had a proper diagnosis or treatment (thanks to
 her husband), I shudder to think of the repercussions
 that could come upon our nation.</p>  

<p>Also keep in mind that this could come upon you some
 day as well if "pro-death" activists speak more
 loudly than "pro-life" activists. Pro-life judges
 cannot even pass the confirmation process anymore.</p>

<p>In  America only half the states will impose the
 death penalty, but strangely, the kind of "progressive
 thinking" that brought about the near abolition of the
 death penalty now champions euthanasia and abortion.</p>

<p>The Left claims to stand up for the underdogs in life,
 but I sense they follow the pattern of Ezekiel 33:31:
 "With their mouth they show much love, but their
 hearts pursue their own gain."</p>  

<p>What is characteristic of a last day's culture is
 culture decline which the Bible predicts. Good will
 be called evil and evil good (Isaiah 5:20). Evil men
 will be "seducers, waxing worse and worse, deceiving
 and being deceived" (II Timothy 3:13). But who would
 ever have thought that such perilous times would have
 come to a simple hospice room?</p>

<p>In our evil generation God is also moving mightily
 because some people are remaining "salt and light."
 There is still time for good to trump certain aspects
 of evil. The end is not yet. God sees the heart of
 the righteous and is merciful.</p>

<p>To better understand this "slippery slope," visit
 my website, <a href="http://www.olivetreeviews.org"

 category of "Culture Decline."</p>
