 ASSISTED SUICIDE---Four Differences between Mercy-Killing and Merciful Death

     FOUR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN  MERCY-KILLING &  MERCIFUL DEATH           SYNOPSIS:           The advent of medical technology that can keep a body 'alive'  for months or even years after the life of the  person has come to an end necessitates some new thinking and new terminology for the process of deciding to end the life of another individual who can no longer decide for himself or herself and who might now have become a  former person .     This cyber-sermon proposes to define and distinguish two concepts that initially might seem to be synonymous:   mercy-killing  and   merciful death  . And the same four distinctions can be used to distinguish  irrational suicide  from   voluntary death  .  OUTLINE:      A.  FOUR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN  MERCY-KILLING &  MERCIFUL DEATH    1.  Is the proposed death  harmful or  helpful to the patient?    2.  Is the proposed death  irrational or  rational ?    3.  Is the proposed death  capricious or  well-planned ?   4.  Is the proposed death  regrettable or  admirable ?     B.  PRACTICAL WAYS TO SEPARATE  MERCY-KILLING FROM  MERCIFUL DEATH    C.   MERCY-KILLING SHOULD REMAIN A CRIME;        MERCIFUL DEATH SHOULD BE PERMITTED AND SUPPORTED         FOUR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN           MERCY-KILLING &  MERCIFUL DEATH       by James Leonard Park     A.  FOUR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN  MERCY-KILLING &  MERCIFUL DEATH    1.  Is the proposed death  harmful or  helpful to the patient?     Mercy-killing is a well-known phenomenon in almost every culture. It happens when someone causes death in another individual with some belief that the death would be  good for the victim. But when the facts come to light, almost everyone agrees that death was  not the best option under those circumstances.     For example, spouses sometimes kill their loved ones  under what turns out to be the false belief that they have cancer. When the body is autopsied by the medical examiner, sometimes no cancer is found. When such mistakes are made by well-meaning spouses, in retrospect even they probably agree that the death was a  harm to the victim. Such cases are correctly called "mercy-killings".     On the other hand, there are situations in which the patient really was suffering an incurable and painful disease. And when all the facts become known, even people who were initially against a chosen death agree that death was a better option than continuing the meaningless suffering.     Increasingly, due to modern life-support systems, the patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to make medical decisions. Then the proxies must gather all of the relevant information  and explore all the remaining medical options  before concluding that death would be the best course of action  for this person or former person.      When the facts and opinions add up to death being the wisest course of action, then this death should be called a "merciful death". This is parallel to a  voluntary death which could have been chosen by the patient himself or herself if he or she was still able to make medical decisions. And often the proxies will have asked themselves: What would this individual have chosen if he or she knew everything that we know? If the patient would have chosen a voluntary death, then the proxies are justified in calling it a  merciful death when they must make the life-ending decision for the patient.     Laws should be re-written wherever necessary so that proxies do in fact have the same powers to choose death  for a patient who has now lost that power to decide for himself or herself. None of us should lose the right-to-die  merely because we can no longer authorize  the necessary actions (or withholding-of-actions) ourselves.   2.  Is the proposed death  irrational  or  rational ?     When other people examine a mercy-killing after the death has occurred,  they determine that the reasons for death were insufficient. The person who committed the mercy-killing probably believed at the time that it was in the best interest of the victim. But when cooler heads examine all of the facts, they decide that it was really an irrational response to a situation that was perhaps misunderstood.     Often the relative of someone who is suffering has a limited understanding of medical matters. This can lead to false ideas about what is likely to happen. And these mistaken beliefs can lead to a mercy-killing.     However, if the proxies for someone who has ceased to function as a full person have examined all the medical facts and opinions, then if they make a wise choice for death, it should be called a "merciful death"    —    not a "mercy-killing". And, of course, there should be no punishment for such a decision for death. Just as the patient could have reached the same conclusion if he or she were still able to weigh medical facts and opinions and reach a wise decision about how to proceed, so the proxies for the patient have thought long and hard about all the possible courses of action  and have reluctantly decided that  death is the best option .     There can always be disagreements about just what is rational and irrational, but at least the  principle can be applied to each specific situation: When the patient can no longer decide, what is the wisest course of action for the proxies to take? If the patient makes a foolish choice for death,  that is called "committing irrational suicide". If someone else make a foolish choice for death, that is called "mercy-killing".           This is the same irrational/rational distinction that separates  irrational suicide from  voluntary death . (See the companion cyber-sermon:  "Four Differences between Irrational Suicide & Voluntary Death" http://www.tc.umn.edu/~parkx032/CY-IS-VD.html )             3.  Is the proposed death  capricious or  well-planned ?     Usually what we later call a mercy-killing was basically a capricious act,  taken on the spur of the moment rather than carefully planned and organized. The man who shoots his wife to end her suffering did not share this plan with anyone else because he feared on some level that others  would not agree with him and would take action to  prevent him from carrying out the mercy-killing. If he has been delayed by other people or circumstances, he probably would have had second thoughts about killing his wife. Good medical information could have assured him that  death today was not the wisest course of action.     In contrast, when the proxies are planning the death of someone they love, they will complete an exhaustive search for the  best medical treatments before they conclude that  no cure is possible . They might consult a variety of medical people before they decide upon a "merciful death". The process of planing for a merciful death  could take up to a year     —    especially in cases of complex diseases that could have several possible outcomes.     Just as a person who is thinking thru his or her own medical care will pursue all meaningful options before deciding to accept death, so the proxies for someone who has lost decision-making capacity will analyze all the facts and collect all relevant medical opinions before deciding that death is the best option available.  And as each of us retains the power to choose a voluntary death while we still have all our wits about us, so our proxies should be duly authorized  to choose death for us after we have lost consciousness  or otherwise become unable to make medical decisions. As a voluntary death can be well planned by the  patient , so a merciful death can be well planned by the  proxies for the patient.       4.  Is the proposed death  regrettable or  admirable ?     When a distraught relative has committed a mercy-killing, everyone who knows about this tragedy  regrets that it turned out this way. We wonder what we should have done to prevent this needless death. And some premature deaths  have been prevented when others learned of a foolish plan to commit mercy-killing.     These evaluations often must be made after the death has occurred. But if we know of any plans to kill a vulnerable person, we can take the necessary steps to prevent such a regrettable crime. However, if a mercy-killing has already taken place, we can only stand back and let the law-enforcement authorities do what they need to do.     On the other hand, when a  merciful death is planned, then there will no need for calling the police. It is a wise and admirable plan to draw this life to a close at the best time    —     not too soon and  not too late . If the patient had been able to participate in the decision for death, he or she would have agreed that death is the wisest course. Then if others must carry out the last acts to bring death, it will be called a wise, merciful death. Again, the proxies should have the same full powers to decide that each of us has  while we are still able to make our own medical decisions.         Law and medical practice will have to change in some degree to make this distinction between  mercy-killing and  merciful death effective in the real world. But the basic tests can be understood by anyone  who knows the differences between: (1) harming or helping;  (2) being irrational or rational; (3) acting capriciously or cautiously; & (4) a death we regret or a death we admire.     Mercy-killings will still take place. And they will have to be dealt with by law enforcement: the police, the prosecutors, the courts, & the prisons.  But the  new concept of merciful death can be put into practice under the the supervision of the medical profession. They can recommend a life-ending decision to the proxies when the facts of the case suggest  that death is the best choice for the patient. Often the death will come about  as the result of disconnecting life-support systems, which has long been recognized  as a valid and reasonable way to draw life to a close. When other methods are needed to shorten the process of dying, these measures can be called "merciful death".    B.  PRACTICAL WAYS TO SEPARATE  MERCY-KILLING FROM  MERCIFUL DEATH     Now that we have outlined the philosophical and psychological differences between the familiar phenomenon of  mercy-killing and the less common practice of  merciful death , we can ask for some  practical methods by which to separate these two.     Here are ten definite steps that anyone can take which will help to tell whether a proposed death  would be a  mercy-killing or a  merciful death :     1.  Living Will and/or other Request for Death from the Patient.     2.  Psychological Consultant Certifies       that the Patient is Competent to Decide. 3.  Doctor's Summary of Condition and Prognosis.  4.  Independent Doctor Confirms the Condition and Prognosis. 5.  Significant Others Agree with the Life-Ending Decision.  6.  Member of the Clergy Approves the Life-Ending Decision.  7.  Ethics Committee Reviews the Life-Ending Decision.  8.  Criminal and Civil Penalties for Causing Premature Death. 9.  Waiting Periods Before Death is Permitted.  10.  Complete Reporting of all Material Facts.     As might be obvious from these ten safeguards, they can be used in all forms of life-ending decisions: (1) while the patient is still capable of making the decision, (2) after the decision-making power has passed to the proxies, (3) in either case when considering withdrawing life-support systems, &  (4) when more active means of drawing life to a close might be appropriate.     In cases of proposed merciful death,  the prior record of choices when the patient was still capable  of making decisions should still be honored. We should  not lose our right-to-die when we become unconscious , for example. Our advance directives and any other documents created by others should still be valid  unless there is some substantial change in the patient's condition that would render the prior decisions invalid or irrelevant.     Anyone who goes to the trouble fulfilling these safeguards should be assumed to be acting in good faith, watching out for the best interests of the patient. For example, someone who has an urge to commit a mercy-killing is not going to consult the ethics committee of the hospital. Proxies who  do ask for input from others  about the wisdom of  death now rather than  death later are much more likely to be planning  what will be called (after the fact) a  merciful death .        The safeguards named above (and a few others) are explained in further detail in another cyber-sermon: Fifteen Safeguards for Life-Ending Decisions : http://www.tc.umn.edu/~parkx032/CY-10SG.html  This cyber-sermon is linked to an  even more comprehensive list of safeguards.   C.   MERCY-KILLING SHOULD REMAIN A CRIME;        MERCIFUL DEATH SHOULD BE PERMITTED AND SUPPORTED     Mercy-killing is different from other forms of murder in that the victim was believed by the perpetrator to be dying anyway. Thus it should be prosecuted under a new section of any homicide laws. This new section should also include the possible crime  of prematurely disconnecting life-support systems, another new means of killing people that our forefathers never thought about.     Here is a draft of such a law, called Causing Premature Death:     http://www.tc.umn.edu/~parkx032/PREM-DTH.html    This draft embodies 26 safeguards. If substantially all of the safeguards are fulfilled, no crime was committed. And the death will be recorded as a  voluntary death  if chosen by the patient . The death will be recorded as a  merciful death  if chosen by proxies for the patient .     Each state or country will have to modify his own homicide laws. But looking ahead by 100 years, we can be confident  that such changes will be common  and that  irrational mercy-killings will continue to be prosecuted  whereas  wise merciful deaths will be permitted and supported.
