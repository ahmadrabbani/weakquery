Enlarge Image      Close     Jordan Family Gigi Jordan and her son, Jude, in an undated family photo.    Ms. Jordan's team has asked a judge to let it proceed with an "altruistic filicide" defense against charges she fed her son, Jude, a fatal cocktail of pills in a $2,300-a-night Midtown hotel room in February 2010. The concept of a child mercy killing has been used to bolster insanity defenses in the past, most notably in the case of Andrea Yates, the Texas mother who drowned her five children in 2001 out of a belief it would save their souls from the devil.  But Ron Kuby and Alan Dershowitz, Ms. Jordan's lawyers, say the concept has not been tried alone, with a defendant who says she is sane.  "I haven't seen it, and I've been interested in this area for over 40 years," said Dr. Philip Resnick, a professor of psychiatry at Case Western University who often testifies about the motives behind parents killing their children. He is not listed among the experts who could be called in Ms. Jordan's defense. In court papers, the defense argues that Ms. Jordan, who has pleaded not guilty, correctly believed her son was threatened by forces so insurmountable, death was the best option.  They are scheduled to appear before Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Charles Solomon on Thursday. The judge is expected to rule on a bail application for Ms. Jordan, but Ms. Jordan's lawyers don't yet expect a decision on the defense. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office isn't buying the argument. Prosecutors have not offered a motive for the murder, and legally they don't have to. In court papers, lead prosecutor Kerry O'Connell has called the altruistic filicide defense "hollow" and an attempt "to execute an end-run" around the fact that Ms. Jordan couldn't satisfy the elements of other legally permissible homicide defenses, such as duress. "While, unquestionably, defendant has a right to a defense, she does not get to simply conjure one from the ether," Ms. O'Connell wrote. Enlarge Image      Close     Getty Images The body of Gigi Jordan's son is removed from the Peninsula Hotel.    Park Dietz is a well-known forensic psychiatrist who has taken the stand for the prosecution in dozens of cases, including twice testifying that Ms. Yates was not legally insane. (A 2002 murder conviction of Ms. Yates was overturned and in 2006 she was found not guilty by reason of insanity.) Mr. Dietz said he believes current law leaves jurors little choice.  "Jurors are stuck in a position today of punishing too much or lying," he said. "A jury must either convict a mother who has committed altruistic filicide with all the stigma and ramifications that come with the conviction or they must...cut her a break and find her insane despite the evidence to the contrary."  If Ms. Jordan's attorneys are allowed to proceed with the defense, they would have to lay out a complex tale behind a death that gripped the city.  "When you first hear Gigi's story, you say to yourself, 'How did all these factors coalesce? This is Calamity Jane on steroids,'" Mr. Dershowitz said. But, he said, the account "is true."  In court papers and in person, Ms. Jordan, a single mother, has claimed that she expected to be murdered because of the tangled business and financial relationship she maintained with her ex-husband. He is not the boy's biological father.  So she said she killed her son to save him from a lifetime of sexual abuse by his biological father, whom she believed would fight for custody and win after her death, her lawyers say in court papers. Ms. Jordan has accused the boy's father of sexual abuse, but he was not charged.  "Being dead is not as bad as having that continue for the rest of his life. It's not as bad. It's a horrible, horrible choice. But the choice was there," Ms. Jordan said in an interview at Rikers Island.  Ms. Jordan's ex-husband, Philadelphia-based businessman Ray Mirra, vigorously denied her accusations, outlined in court papers, that he stole millions from her and was plotting to harm her. She did not go to law enforcement with her allegations until after her arrest, though she had hired a lawyer and an accounting firm to go through the books of their companies.  In a statement issued by his attorney, Mr. Mirra said he is "deeply saddened by these events and the depth to which Ms. Jordan and her counsel have apparently sunk. The allegations appear to be a sad attempt to change the focus in the criminal cases against Ms. Jordan from whether she murdered her 8-year-old son to something completely irrelevant to that question."  The boy's biological father, California yoga instructor Emil Tzekov, could not be reached for comment. When Ms. Jordan's allegations of abuse emerged soon after Jude's death, Mr. Tzekov denied hurting his son. Mr. Tzekov told the New York Daily News at the time: "It's clear to me that she was totally insane. It doesn't make any sense." He added, "The police, they know better. They talked to me afterward. They know it's not true." The Manhattan District Attorney's Office also says in court papers that there is no evidence of any crimes committed in connection with this case by Messrs. Mirra or Tzekov. When she checked into the Peninsula Hotel in February 2010, Ms. Jordan had been through a long journey with her son, she said. Mr. Mirra and Ms. Jordan, who grew up on the Upper West Side and became a nurse, broke up in 1998 after the pair built a number of successful medical companies. They remained business partners. After meeting Mr. Tzekov at a Manhattan gym two years later, Ms. Jordan asked him to help her become a mother, she said in an interview.  Jude was born on July 13, 2001. For a year, he was healthy and happy, she said.  But at 13 months he stopped talking and reverted to crawling. By then, Ms. Jordan had moved to northern California, having left New York City after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Ms. Jordan said she crisscrossed the country in pursuit of diagnoses and treatment for her son, who rarely spoke. He received a variety of treatments, both traditional and unconventional. He would improve, only to regress, according to Ms. Jordan and medical records. Mr. Tzekov, who had relinquished parental rights, was in and out of the boy's life, Ms Jordan said.  Ms. Jordan claims in court papers outlining her defense that in 2008, Jude began communicating with her by typing on a laptop, describing sexual and physical abuse by Mr. Tzekov and a babysitter. She became convinced this was the source of Jude's problems. Ms. Jordan filed a series of complaints with San Francisco child protective services and law enforcement agencies. Her lawyers say they plan to argue that a lack of interest by agencies fed her belief that she was isolated and out of options.  A spokeswoman for the Human Services Agency of San Francisco said the agency evaluates every complaint it receives but declined to comment further, citing privacy concerns. When Ms. Jordan traveled to Wyoming seeking help in April 2008, authorities temporarily removed Jude from her custody.  Ms. Jordan had flown to Cheyenne on short notice to meet a former FBI agent who specialized in child sex abuse cases. The retired agent believed Ms. Jordan sounded agitated, and contacted local police officials, who met her at the airport, according to court papers and interviews. Authorities placed Jude with a children's welfare agency. At the conclusion of a custody hearing, Laramie County First Judicial Court Judge Edward Grant said he was reluctant to return Jude to Ms. Jordan. But he said he could not keep Jude away from his mother on a hunch that "something untoward might happen," according to a transcript of the hearing reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.  Mr. Grant, now retired from the Wyoming bench, had not heard that Ms. Jordan took her son's life. "My recollection was her behavior was certainly outside the norm but not of a nature that she had any intention of killing her child or even that she was sufficiently irrational that she'd inadvertently hurt her child," he said. Not quite two years after the hearing, Ms. Jordan gave her son a fatal dose of pills. She then downed a handful herself. But she did not die.  City police, alerted by an aunt who received an email from Ms. Jordan detailing her plans, broke into the locked and barricaded hotel room and found her on the floor, "incoherent," with a faint pulse, according to a police report. She was arrested.  Write to  Sean Gardiner at  sean.gardiner@wsj.com       Copyright 2011 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.
