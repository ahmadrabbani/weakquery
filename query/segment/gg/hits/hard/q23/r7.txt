Prosecutors painted a different scenario, saying Marcus Anthony Shuff, 48, killed Albert Walter Lacy, 74, in a failed robbery attempt before he could learn the combination to Lacy’s safe, which contained $50,000. Shuff dropped his head as Judge Wayne J. Mallia of Galveston’s 405th District Court read the jury’s guilty verdict. Lacy was known to carry cash and to help drug addicts by providing work, food and clothing. Authorities found Lacy beaten to death Oct. 5, 2007, on the couch of his Bacliff home. Prosecutors played for the nine-woman, three-man jury Shuff’s Nov. 21, 2009, videotaped confession at Texas City police headquarters.
