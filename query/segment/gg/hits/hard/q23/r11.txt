Roy Charles Laird of Seal Beach is scheduled to appear in court Nov. 30 at the West Justice Center in Westminster. He is being held at Orange County Jail in lieu of $1 million bail.   Roy Charles Laird, 88 SEAL BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT, SEAL BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT  ADVERTISEMENT  VIDEO: Police: Husband shot wife at nursing home:  &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Your browser does not support iframes.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;          Laird is charged with one felony count of murder with a sentencing enhancement for the personal discharge of a firearm causing death, the district attorney's office said.  If convicted, Laird faces a maximum sentence of 50 years to life in state prison, prosecutors said.  On Sunday at approximately 12 p.m., Laird walked into his wife's room at the Country Villa Healthcare Center with a gun and shot her in the head while she was lying in bed, prosecutors said. An employee heard the gunshot and called 911.  Sgt. Steve Bowles of the Seal Beach Police Department said Laird gave no trouble to officers who arrested him.  "He was very somber," Bowles said. "He was very passive and not resistant at all."  Laird and his wife, Clara Laird, were married for 69 years, prosecutors said. They were living apart while she stayed at the nursing home, according to prosecutors.  Prosecutors said she had late-stage dementia and needed 24-hour care.  In a Los Angeles Times interview , the couple's daughter, Kathy Palmateer, 68, said "it was a mercy killing."  Senior Deputy District Attorney Scott Simmons, who is prosecuting the case, said a mercy killing is not a defense in California.  "It's a murder," Simmons said. "He took his wife's life."
