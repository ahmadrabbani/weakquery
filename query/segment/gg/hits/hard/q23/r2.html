&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advent of medical technology that can keep a
body 'alive' <br>
for months or even years after the life of the <u>person</u> has come
to an end<br>
necessitates some new thinking and new terminology<br>
for the process of deciding to end the life of another individual<br>
who can no longer decide for himself or herself<br>
and who might now have become a <span

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This cyber-sermon proposes to define and distinguish
two concepts<br>
that initially might seem to be synonymous: <font color="#ff0000"><u>mercy-killing</u></font>
and <font color="#009900"><u>merciful death</u></font>.<br>
And the same four distinctions can be used to distinguish<br>

A.&nbsp; FOUR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN <font color="#ff0000">MERCY-KILLING</font>
&amp; <font color="#009900">MERCIFUL DEATH</font></font></b><br>
<b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
<big>1.&nbsp; Is the proposed death <font color="#ff0000">harmful</font>
or <font color="#009900">helpful</font> to the patient?</big><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercy-killing is a well-known phenomenon in almost
every culture.<br>
It happens when someone causes death in another individual<br>
with some belief that the death would be <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">good</span> for the victim.<br>
But when the facts come to light, almost everyone agrees<br>
that death was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>
the best option under those circumstances.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, spouses sometimes kill their loved ones
<br>
under what turns out to be the false belief that they have cancer.<br>
When the body is autopsied by the medical examiner,<br>
sometimes no cancer is found.<br>
When such mistakes are made by well-meaning spouses,<br>
in retrospect even they probably agree that the death was a <u>harm</u>
to the victim.<br>
Such cases are correctly called "mercy-killings".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, there are situations in which the
patient<br>
really was suffering an incurable and painful disease.<br>
And when all the facts become known,<br>
even people who were initially against a chosen death<br>
agree that death was a better option than continuing the meaningless
suffering.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increasingly, due to modern life-support systems,<br>
the patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to make medical
decisions.<br>
Then the proxies must gather all of the relevant information <br>
and explore all the remaining medical options <br>
before concluding that death would be the best course of action <br>
for this person or former person. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the facts and opinions add up to death being
the wisest course of action,<br>
then this death should be called a "merciful death".<br>
This is parallel to a <u>voluntary death</u><br>
which could have been chosen by the patient himself or herself<br>
if he or she was still able to make medical decisions.<br>
And often the proxies will have asked themselves:<br>
What would this individual have chosen<br>
if he or she knew everything that we know?<br>
If the patient would have chosen a voluntary death,<br>
then the proxies are justified in calling it a <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">merciful death</span><br>
when they must make the life-ending decision for the patient.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laws should be re-written wherever necessary<br>
so that proxies do in fact have the same powers to choose death <br>
for a patient who has now lost that power to decide for himself or
herself.<br>
None of us should lose the right-to-die <br>
merely because we can no longer authorize <br>
the necessary actions (or withholding-of-actions) ourselves.</font></b><br>
<br>
<hr style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 255);" size="2" width="100%"><b><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
<big>2.&nbsp; Is the proposed death <font color="#ff0000">irrational </font>or
<font color="#009900">rational</font>?</big><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When other people examine a mercy-killing after the
death has occurred, <br>
they determine that the reasons for death were insufficient.<br>
The person who committed the mercy-killing<br>
probably believed at the time that it was in the best interest of the
victim.<br>
But when cooler heads examine all of the facts,<br>
they decide that it was really an irrational response<br>
to a situation that was perhaps misunderstood.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often the relative of someone who is suffering<br>
has a limited understanding of medical matters.<br>
This can lead to false ideas about what is likely to happen.<br>
And these mistaken beliefs can lead to a mercy-killing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if the proxies for someone who has ceased
to function as a full person<br>
have examined all the medical facts and opinions,<br>
then if they make a wise choice for death,<br>
it should be called a "merciful death"</font></b><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bold;"><b>&#8212;</b></span><b><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">not a "mercy-killing".<br>
And, of course, there should be no punishment for such a decision for
death.<br>
Just as the patient could have reached the same conclusion<br>
if he or she were still able to weigh medical facts and opinions<br>
and reach a wise decision about how to proceed,<br>
so the proxies for the patient have thought long and hard<br>
about all the possible courses of action <br>
and have reluctantly decided that <u>death is the
best option</u>.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There can always be disagreements about just what is
rational and irrational,<br>
but at least the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">principle</span>
can be applied to each specific situation:<br>
When the patient can no longer decide,<br>
what is the wisest course of action for the proxies to take?<br>
If the patient makes a foolish choice for death, <br>
that is called "committing irrational suicide".<br>
If someone else make a foolish choice for death,<br>
that is called "mercy-killing". &nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">&nbsp;
This is the same irrational/rational distinction<br>
that separates <span style="text-decoration: underline;">irrational
suicide</span> from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">voluntary
death</span>.<br>
(See the companion cyber-sermon: <br>
"Four Differences between Irrational Suicide &amp; Voluntary Death"<br>

Is the proposed death <font color="#ff0000">capricious</font> or <font
 color="#009900">well-planned</font>?</big><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually what we later call a mercy-killing was
basically a capricious act, <br>
taken on the spur of the moment rather than carefully planned and
organized.<br>
The man who shoots his wife to end her suffering<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">did not share this plan</span>
with anyone else<br>
because he feared on some level that others <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">would not agree</span> with him<br>
and would take action to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prevent</span>
him from carrying out the mercy-killing.<br>
If he has been delayed by other people or circumstances,<br>
he probably would have had second thoughts about killing his wife.<br>
Good medical information could have assured him<br>
that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">death today</span> was
not the wisest course of action.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast, when the proxies are planning the death
of someone they love,<br>
they will complete an exhaustive search for the <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">best medical treatments</span><br>
before they conclude that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no
cure is possible</span>.<br>
They might consult a variety of medical people<br>
before they decide upon a "merciful death".<br>
The process of planing for a merciful death <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">could take up to a year</span><br>
</font></b><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bold;"><b>&#8212;</b></span><b><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">especially in cases of complex
diseases that could have several
possible outcomes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as a person who is thinking thru his or her own
medical care<br>
will pursue all meaningful options before deciding to accept death,<br>
so the proxies for someone who has lost decision-making capacity<br>
will analyze all the facts and collect all relevant medical opinions<br>
before deciding that death is the best option available. <br>
And as each of us retains the power to choose a voluntary death<br>
while we still have all our wits about us,<br>
so our proxies should be duly authorized <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">to choose death for us</span> <br>
after we have lost consciousness <br>
or otherwise become unable to make medical decisions.<br>
As a voluntary death can be well planned by the <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">patient</span>,<br>
so a merciful death can be well planned by the <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">proxies</span> for the patient.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a distraught relative has committed a
mercy-killing,<br>
everyone who knows about this tragedy <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">regrets</span> that it turned out
this
way.<br>
We wonder what we should have done to prevent this needless death.<br>
And some premature deaths <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have
been prevented</span><br>
when others learned of a foolish plan to commit mercy-killing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These evaluations often must be made after the death
has occurred.<br>
But if we know of any plans to kill a vulnerable person,<br>
we can take the necessary steps to prevent such a regrettable crime.<br>
However, if a mercy-killing has already taken place,<br>
we can only stand back and let the law-enforcement authorities<br>
do what they need to do.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, when a <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">merciful death</span> is planned,<br>
then there will no need for calling the police.<br>

 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">not
too soon</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not too
late</span>.<br>
If the patient had been able to participate in the decision for death,<br>
he or she would have agreed that death is the wisest course.<br>
Then if others must carry out the last acts to bring death,<br>
it will be called a wise, merciful death.<br>
Again, the proxies should have the same full powers to decide<br>
that each of us has <br>
while we are still able to make our own medical
decisions.<br>

as the result of disconnecting life-support systems,<br>

B.&nbsp; PRACTICAL WAYS TO SEPARATE <font color="#ff0000">MERCY-KILLING</font>
FROM <font color="#009900">MERCIFUL DEATH</font><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we have outlined the philosophical and
psychological differences<br>
between the familiar phenomenon of <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">mercy-killing</span><br>
and the less common practice of <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">merciful
death</span>,<br>
we can ask for some <span style="text-decoration: underline;">practical
methods</span> by which to separate these two.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are ten definite steps that anyone can take<br>
which will help to tell whether a proposed death <br>
would be a <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">mercy-killing</span>
or a <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">merciful death</span>:<br>
<br>
</font></b><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">1.&nbsp; Living
Will and/or other Request for Death from the Patient. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

9.&nbsp; Waiting Periods Before Death is Permitted.

<br>
10.&nbsp; Complete Reporting of all Material Facts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As might be obvious from these ten safeguards,<br>
they can be used in all forms of life-ending decisions:<br>
(1) while the patient is still capable of making the decision,<br>
(2) after the decision-making power has passed to the proxies,<br>
(3) in either case when considering withdrawing life-support systems,
&amp; <br>
(4) when more active means of drawing life to a close might be
appropriate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In cases of proposed merciful death, <br>
the prior record of choices when the patient was still capable <br>
of making decisions should still be honored.<br>
We should <a href="http://www.tc.umn.edu/%7Eparkx032/CY-CONSC.html">not
lose our right-to-die when we become unconscious</a>, for
example.<br>
Our advance directives and any other documents created by others<br>
should still be valid <br>
unless there is some substantial change in the patient's condition<br>
that would render the prior decisions invalid or irrelevant.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone who goes to the trouble fulfilling these
safeguards<br>
should be assumed to be acting in good faith,<br>
watching out for the best interests of the patient.<br>
For example, someone who has an urge to commit a mercy-killing<br>
is not going to consult the ethics committee of the hospital.<br>
Proxies who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do ask</span>
for input from others <br>
about the wisdom of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">death now</span>
rather than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">death later</span><br>
are much more likely to be planning <br>
what will be called (after the fact) a <u>merciful death</u>.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercy-killing is different from other forms of murder<br>
in that the victim was believed by the perpetrator to be dying anyway.<br>
Thus it should be prosecuted under a new section of any homicide laws.<br>
This new section should also include the possible crime <br>
