Slot machines have been legal in the state since 1990, but only after two ballot measures, a legal battle and negotiations between the state and Indian tribes settled the issue. The state has a cap on the statewide number of slot machines allowed at Indian casinos, but multiple tribes have sued to have the number increased.     Legality California allows slot machines and other gambling machines in Indian casinos as long as the machines don't pay coins or currency and don't have to be activated with a handle. Because of this, slot machines in the state are activated by the push-button method and instead of paying out money directly, the machines issue paper vouchers to winners that a casino cashier can redeem. California voters approved the addition of slot machines to Native American casinos as part of a statewide ballot measure allowing certain types of gaming on Native American lands.     Limits In 1999, the state set gambling contracts with 61 Native American tribes that included a provision that each Indian casino is allowed to have up to 2,000 slot machines. However, at the time, the state capped the total number of slot machines statewide at 32,151. In recent years, however, some Indian tribes have sued to have the number increased. Under the state constitution, the governor is authorized to enter into contracts with tribes to operate slot machines and other forms of gambling on tribal land, but the contracts must be approved by the state Legislature to become valid, and have to be with tribes that are recognized by the federal government.     Paybacks & Returns Native American tribes in California aren't required to release information on their slot machine payback percentages, nor does the state require any minimum returns for slots in tribal casinos. The payback percentage is the overall percentage of money that a machine will return to a player in the long run, and can be anywhere from 75 to 99 percent, depending on how the machine is programmed. A minimum return would be the lowest payback percentage allowed.
