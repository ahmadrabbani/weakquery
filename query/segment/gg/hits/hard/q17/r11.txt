They built it in the shape of a mall, just in case they opened the doors and nobody out there wanted to gamble. Plenty of people, as it turned out, were desperate to gamble, first at 90 tables, then at room after room of newfangled electronic slot and gaming machines. Located east of Syracuse, the Turning Stone Casino Resort now lures 4.2 million gamblers a year, most from New York State, judging from the license plates on the cars out front. These gamblers spend more than $230 million for food, golf, hotels, entertainment and, of course, games of chance. How much they win from the casino is an Oneida Nation secret. All told, Turning Stone, with profits estimated at $70 million a year, offers New York and other states an important lesson about how to negotiate with tribes as they look urgently to casinos as a way out of debt. This compact in 1993 was really a one-way deal designed by Gov. Mario Cuomo to help the Oneidas. It turned out to be a straight flush, at least for Oneida leaders and many, but not all, of the 1,000 people in the tribe.                       The state got almost nothing out of that 1993 deal: no shared profits, no automatic percentage of the take to help communities with roads or police, fire or health services. Ray Halbritter and his Oneidas run the casino with nearly complete control over the businesses, tribal affairs and the distribution and use of the tribe's considerable profits. It is hard to argue that all those towns outside the casino have lost ground financially -- some have not. But whatever the casino's neighbors gained was basically what the Oneida leadership was willing to part with. The casino provides about 2,500 jobs to non-Indians. The tribe buys over $120 million in goods and services around the state. And the Oneidas donate millions of dollars to favored charities and communities they consider friendly to their interests. As manufacturing operations in upstate New York shed workers or even close, the casino is fast becoming the only mill in town. The resort is expanding rapidly, adding luxury resort amenities on the reservation and buying nearby local businesses like service stations and convenience stores. With each purchase, the Oneidas declare the land to be an addition to their reservation. That means they do not pay property taxes.      1   2    NEXT PAGE >           More Like This  Accord Signed for a Casino in New York State    Neighbors See Lesson in Oneida Casino Deal: What Not to Do    Once Destitute, Oneida Tribe Braces for Flood of Gambling...
