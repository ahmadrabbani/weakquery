In 1979 the Seminoles opened a high-stakes bingo hall on their reservation. Almost immediately the state of Florida moved in to try to close down the operation, however they were stopped by the courts. Despite the early court victories of the Seminoles the legality of Indian casino gaming was very much in doubt.   Another important case in the history of Indian casino gaming was that of California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians. In 1987 it was ruled by the Supreme Court that Indian tribal governments in their sovereignty could operate gaming institutions outside of state regulation, assuming that gaming operations were not directly prohibited in that state. At present only two states in the United States, Utah and Hawai'i strictly prohibit gambling.    The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA)    With Indian casino gaming now given definitive legal status by the Supreme Court, it was time for Congress to move in. In 1988 they passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) to set the rules for Indian casino gaming.   For one thing, the IGRA separates gaming into three classes. Class I gaming is defined as traditional tribal gaming and social gaming with minimal prizes. There is no regulation whatsoever for Class I gaming outside of the respective tribal governments.     1  2  3   Next Page   Published by  Allen Butler  Allen Butler is a freelance writer and tutor living in Austin, TX.    View profile    Native American Casinos   The Native American tribes are sovereign.
