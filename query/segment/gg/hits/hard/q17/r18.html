<B>Monday, January 10, 2005</B></P>

<P>Economic and social conditions in Indian Country improved substantially over the past decade, according to a Harvard University study released last week, with progress by gaming tribes outpacing non-gaming tribes.</P>

<P>Using 10 years of U.S. Census Bureau data, researchers at the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development discovered gains in income, education, housing and other indicators. In every category, conditions improved greatly for American Indians living on reservations from 1990 to 2000, the report said.</P>

<P>With financial backing from the National Indian Gaming Association, the authors of the study compared progress among members of tribes with and without casinos. The aim was to show the impacts of gaming on tribal lands.</P>

<P>"The results are remarkable," researchers wrote in American Indians on Reservations: A Databook of Socioeconomic Change Between the 1990 and 2000 Censuses, released last Wednesday. "In all but two categories, Census-measured socioeconomic improvement is greater for gaming reservations than for non-gaming reservations."</P>

<P>In some categories, progress among gaming tribes was far greater than among non-gaming tribes. For example, per capita income rose by 36 percent for members of tribes with casinos versus 21 percent for members of tribes without casinos. Median household income among gaming tribes rose by 35 percent compared to just 14 percent among non-gaming tribes.</P>

<P>In other areas, the difference wasn't as notable but was still apparent. Family poverty, child poverty and deep poverty rates, for example, dropped for gaming and non-gaming tribes alike but gaming tribes saw slightly better improvement.</P>

<P>Data for two categories  public assistance and homes without complete kitchens  showed that conditions on reservations without gaming worsened slightly from 1990 to 2000. But gaming tribes saw progress in these areas, according to the report.</P>

<P>And non-gaming tribes beat out gaming tribes based on two indicators  overcrowding and homes lacking complete plumbing. Non-gaming tribes made larger gains in these two areas, the data showed.</P>

<P>The authors of the report acknowledged the benefits of gaming in Indian Country. But they pointed out that the real reason for progress was <A HREF="http://www.bluecorncomics.com/sovreign.htm">self-determination</A>.</P>

<img src="http://www.bluecorncomics.com/pics/chumash4.jpg" align="right" width=400>
<P>According to the report, "self-rule brings decision making home, and local decision makers are held more accountable to local needs, conditions, and cultures than outsiders."</P>

<P>Jackie Johnson, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, agreed with the assessment. "The data reflects that when tribes are truly empowered to govern, our communities grow," she said. "There has been a ripple of positive change in tribal communities, as tribes make their own sound decisions on what is best for their citizens."</P>

<P>The report also noted that Indians living on reservations are still worse off than the rest of the nation. "Despite these positive changes, average income in Indian Country is less than half the overall U.S. average," said co-author Jonathan Taylor, a research fellow. "American Indians still have a long way to go to address the accumulation of long-enduring socioeconomic deficits."</P>

<P>"The report details how far we have come in a 10 year period but it is also a stark reminder of how far we still have to go to overcome the hundreds of years of poverty we have and continue to endure," added Ernie Stevens Jr., chairman of NIGA.</P>

<P>The report excludes Alaska Natives from the discussion of social and economic conditions. There are more than 200 federally-recognized tribes in the state but few are able to offer gaming due to legal limits on their sovereignty.</P>

<P>The report also takes special note of Oklahoma due to the way the Census Bureau collects data for "Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Areas," which cover nearly all of the state and reflect social and economic change for non-Indians as well as Indians. The data is presented with and without OTSAs in the report.</P>

<P>Similarly, data is presented with and without the Navajo Nation because the tribe is the largest in the county and did not operate gaming facilities during the 1990s.</P>

<P>Funding for the study came in part from NIGA but the organization, which represents more than 150 tribes, did not have control over the contents.</P>
</DIR>

<P>This study reiterates points made by Indian gaming leaders.  Namely, that gaming is no get-rich-quick scheme.  That not all tribes are finding prosperity through gaming.  That more work needs to be done.</P>

<P>In short, that Indian gaming is no panacea.  Keep this in mind when you read anti-gaming propaganda about how Indians are so <A HREF="http://www.bluecorncomics.com/greedy.htm">greedy</A> and <A HREF="http://www.bluecorncomics.com/powerful.htm">powerful</A>.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>ERNEST L. STEVENS: Everyone Wins With Indian Gambling</FONT></P>

<P>Indian gaming has been a success for the federal and state governments. Annually, Indian gaming increases federal government revenue by over $4.5 billion and reduces unemployment and welfare benefits by $1 billion. Indian gaming generates more than $1.5 billion in state payroll, income, and sales taxes, fees and revenue sharing last year.</P>

<img src="http://www.bluecorncomics.com/pics/smday.jpg" align="right" width=400>
<P>Indian gaming creates more than 300,000 jobs directly and a total of 500,000 jobs, directly and indirectly nationwide, 75 percent held by our non-Indian neighbors. In the areas of highest Indian unemployment (sometimes 60 percent) 75 percent of the jobs are held by Indians as in North and South Dakota, where Indian gaming has created more than 5,000 jobs. Many of our tribes, like the Mashantucket Pequot, the Mohegan, the Oneida Nation, and the Elk Valley Rancheria created jobs in once prosperous areas that were devastated by the decline of major industries like fisheries, manufacturing and military industry.</P>

<P>It is important to know that tribes use gaming revenues to develop governmental infrastructure: schools, health clinics, water and sewer systems, roads, and other services. The Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe in Minnesota has built two schools. The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation recently opened a cultural and educational facility, which is connected to its Child Development Center. The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma built a new hospital. The Gila River Tribe in Arizona opened a new dialysis center to combat the highest rate of diabetes in the world and the Ak-Chin Indian Community is building new reservation housing.</P>

<P>Through gaming, tribes are finally beginning to diversify our economies, creating more job opportunity, and generating additional revenues for building governmental infrastructure. In California, the San Manuel Band built a bottled water plant. The Tulalip Tribe in Washington operates a shopping center, anchored by a Wal-Mart. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is manufacturing greeting cards.</P>

<P>Most Indian casinos don't enjoy a semi-monopoly in a location near wealthy urbanites.  In other words, most aren't Foxwoods Resort Casino or Mohegan Sun.  The following is more indicative of how gaming is helping impoverished reservations.  From the Albuquerque Journal:</P>

<P>By Mike Gallagher<br>
Journal Investigative Reporter</P>

<P>A visitor to a pueblo ceremonial dance 32 years ago would have found communal water spigots, dilapidated buildings and outhouses.</P>

<P>Tourists sometimes called it "quaint."</P>

<P>"Quaint" might be picturesque but it doesn't supply clean water for children to drink. The correct word was "poverty."</P>

<img src="http://www.bluecorncomics.com/pics/sandiamt.jpg" align="right" width=500>
<P>Three decades ago, most New Mexico pueblos relied on natural resource leases, federal money and tourist dollars spent at seasonal ceremonial dances.</P>

<P>Per-capita incomes were among the lowest in the United States. Unemployment rates in some cases approached 70 percent.</P>

<P>Thanks to gambling, that landscape is changing.</P>

<P>The millions of dollars flowing through tribal casinos are building sewer and water systems, new schools, medical clinics and new homes for New Mexico's gaming tribes.</P>

<P>New Mexico Indian Gaming Association chairman Charlie Dorame said his pueblo, Tesuque, has spent more than $20 million in casino profits in the last few years on infrastructure.</P>

<P>"That's more money than we received from the federal government since 1976," he said.</P>

<P>Gov. Leonard Armijo of Santa Ana Pueblo said the infrastructure spending is essential.</P>

<P>"You can't have economic development without a modern water system," he said. "You can't attract businesses without infrastructure."</P>

<!-- <P>Not all the new tribal economic infrastructure is hidden below ground.</P>

<P>Sandia is building a new resort hotel and golf course, joining Santa Ana, which has the Tamaya resort; and Mescalero tore down the Inn of the Mountain Gods and is building a 211-room luxury hotel and a larger casino with 1,000 slot machines.</P>

<P>Gaming also has made it possible for tribes to spend millions to hire high-powered law firms and lobbyists to pursue various economic and legal agendas important to the pueblos, as well as some investment strategies that have turned controversial.</P>

<P>In addition to a desperate economic situation before Indian gaming, the underlying cultural values were also in danger.</P>

<P>People were leaving the insulated and religious pueblo life for the military and for government jobs in Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Fewer were fluent in their native tongue. Skills like weaving and pottery-making for religious ceremonies were dying out as older tribal members passed away.</P>

<P>A few years ago, only Sandia Pueblo members over the age of 50 knew how to speak Tiwa, their native language. At Santa Ana Pueblo, the cutoff age for speaking Keres was 48.</P>

<P>Now, native language classes begin in preschool at both pueblos.</P>

<P>"Our language was dying," said Sandia Pueblo Gov. Stuwart Paisano. "Now 100 percent of our children are being taught our native tongue."</P>

<P><B>No direct distribution</B></P>

<P>A common misperception of Indian gaming is that casino profits are distributed directly to tribal members.</P>

<P>That doesn't happen in New Mexico.</P>

<P>To distribute casino profits to individual members, gaming tribes would have to pass a law authorizing and explaining the distribution. Then the tribe would need approval from the Department of the Interior.</P>

<img src="http://www.bluecorncomics.com/pics/acoma1.jpg" align="right" width=500>
<P>New Mexico tribes have not gone that route.</P>

<P>"The (Sandia) Council's main focus is on the community," Paisano said. "There are a lot of associated social problems that just get worse when you hand out cash."</P>

<P>Santa Ana Gov. Armijo said, "We don't want to make our people dependent on gaming money."</P>

<P>Dorame said handing out money "really isn't the pueblo way."</P>

<P>"We don't weigh success by the amount of money people have in their pocket. It is the success of the community that matters."</P>

<P>Every pueblo leader the Journal interviewed said the tribal government views casino profits like a city or town would view gross receipts and property taxes.</P>

<P>"I think this attitude stems from basic values," Paisano said. "The Council always goes back to what is important culture, language and religion."</P>

<P>Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chávez was an outspoken opponent of legalizing gaming, including Indian casinos.</P>

<P>"I've come to accept the reality that gaming isn't going away," Chávez said. "But what has impressed me the most is the sophistication the pueblos have shown in handling the money."</P>

<P><B>Home improvement</B></P>

<P>Ask a tribal leader about what the tribe has done with casino profits and invariably they start talking about sewer hookups.</P>

<P>"We have a crisis with ground-water contamination in this valley," said Ron Lovato, San Juan Pueblo's development director. "We are working on it. We have 95 percent of the homes hooked into the sewer system."</P>

<P>San Juan is a medium-sized pueblo with more than 700 homes now hooked up to the sewer system.</P>

<P>At Sandia, the hookup rate is at 98 percent, Paisano said.</P>

<P>Replacing septic tanks with sewer systems is an expensive undertaking.</P>

<img src="http://www.bluecorncomics.com/pics/sanjuan1.jpg" align="right" width=500>
<P>Running sewer lines to a residence can cost between $10,000 and $15,000. Hooking the home up to the sewer line can cost more than $1,200.</P>

<P>Those costs don't include waste-water treatment.</P>

<P>Local governments normally issue bonds to fund water systems, a method that until gaming was unavailable to tribes because they lacked the long-term revenues used to pay off the bonds.</P>

<P>"We pay cash," Lovato said.</P>

<P>Sewer systems weren't the only infrastructure missing from tribal lands.</P>

<P>"There were no road departments. No parks and recreation departments. No trash collection," Lovato said. "We are in fact building from scratch. The casino funded the trash transfer station."</P>

<P>Tesuque's Dorame said, "I think the Indian Gaming Compacts are too short. We are 20 to 30 years away from building all the necessary infrastructure."</P>

<P>Tesuque, Dorame said, needs 110 new homes but federal money for housing on the pueblo amounts to about $150,000 a year.</P>

<P>"We are pumping in the rest," he said.</P>

<P>At Santa Ana and Sandia pueblos, the housing programs are producing new homes after each tribe set up a mortgage program.</P>

<P>Sandia's operates like a traditional mortgage but with zero interest. Santa Ana's housing program uses life insurance annuities to reduce a monthly mortgage payment on a $100,000 home to $250.</P>

<P>"Banks wouldn't loan money for homes on tribal lands because they couldn't foreclose," Paisano said. "We used casino profits to create a mortgage fund that tribal members can tap into after a local bank reviews their qualifications.</P>

<P>"Young people left the pueblo because they had to live with mom and dad," Paisano said. "Now we have a new housing program and people are coming back."</P>

<P><B>Seeking to diversify</B></P>

<img src="http://www.bluecorncomics.com/pics/jemez.jpg" align="right" width=500>
<P>Many tribes have been taking their own advice and are trying to expand their economic base.</P>

<P>Unemployment rates on Indian lands nationally run between 45 and 55 percent.</P>

<P>Six of the gaming pueblos Sandia, Isleta, Santa Ana, Taos, San Juan and Pojoaque have unemployment rates in the single digits. Sandia Pueblo has an unemployment rate of 1 percent, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</P>

<P>The success isn't uniform. Gaming tribes such as Mescalero and Jicarilla have unemployment rates of 44 and 33 percent respectively, according to the same BIA report.</P>

<P>A 2002 national study found that tribes with casinos saw a 26 percent increase in Indian employment and the percentage of working poor dropped by 14 percent.</P>

<P>That is a trend tribal leaders want to continue.</P>

<P>Some Indian casinos are expanding operations to include hotels and golf courses in the hopes of expanding the gambling market to out-of-state and overseas tourists.</P>

<P>"We're going to have work closely with the local hotel associations," Dorame said. "It will require partnerships off the reservation to accomplish this."</P>

<P>Mescalero Apache casino is working on a $2 million advertising campaign in conjunction with Ruidoso and the Ruidoso Downs horse track and casino. The tribe will contribute the bulk of the money, targeting potential tourists from Texas.</P>

<P>Santa Ana Pueblo has been courting retail outlets for property set aside on U.S. 550.</P>

<P>Sandia Pueblo bought the Coronado Airport near I-25 for a high-tech industrial park and has plans for an RV park.</P>

<P>"Our council has taken a conservative approach to off-reservation investments," said Paisano. "We get approached all the time."</P>

<P>San Juan Pueblo is expanding an airstrip in the Española Valley in hopes of attracting manufacturing jobs.</P>

<P>"We've met with officials at Los Alamos Laboratory to try to get some interest in developing business offshoots in the Española Valley," San Juan development director Lovato said. "We've been actively recruiting manufacturers to the area. We hope the airport serves as a linchpin to those efforts."</P>

<P><B>A rocky transition</B></P>

<img src="http://www.bluecorncomics.com/pics/laguna.jpg" align="right" width=500>
<P>Laguna Pueblo has built a grocery store. Many tribes have built gas stations that pay no state gasoline taxes.</P>

<P>But not all has been smooth. Sandia found itself part of a nationwide story when a Senate committee launched an investigation of a Washington lobbyist-public relations team that had been paid more than $45 million by more than a dozen tribes, including Sandia.</P>

<P>Sandia had hired Jack Abramoff to lobby for congressional approval of a land settlement agreement involving more than 9,000 acres on the west face of the Sandia Mountains.</P>

<P>Paisano said the tribe was not satisfied with the firm's work and was upset when it was disclosed that Abramoff in e-mails had referred to his Indian clients as "morons," "monkeys" and "losers."</P>

<P>Paisano said, "There have been missteps."</P>

<P>Tribes have found that getting into new businesses hasn't been a sure thing.</P>

<P>Santa Ana Pueblo went to court after a $1 million investment in a Chinese computer school went awry.</P>

<P>But the bulk of the tribe's economic development efforts have been in the tourism industry.</P>

<P>Bob Ortiz, a planner at Santa Ana Pueblo, said, "We developed the Hyatt Tamaya resort and opened it. Then the attacks of 9/11 took place and we took a $1 million loss, but it has bounced back."</P>

<P>Sandoval County recently helped the tribe restructure and lower interest rates on its resort debt by providing conduit financing for more than $60 million in bonds.</P>

<P>"Right now 90 percent of the tribal budget comes from gaming. That's our budget," Ortiz said. "The tribe is trying to move beyond that."</P>

<P><B>Recovering lands</B></P>

<P>Tribal leaders stressed the need to form alliances with non-Indian governments on issues from the environment to economic development.</P>

<P>The issue that may bring conflict is land acquisition.</P>

<P>Like disputes over water rights, this issue predates Indian gaming. But casino profits have given tribes the economic power to buy, or bring lawsuits for, property that individual tribes believe was lost under Spanish, Mexican or United States rule.</P>

<img src="http://www.bluecorncomics.com/pics/taosmtns.jpg" align="right" width=500>
<P>Sandia, Acoma, Taos, Santa Clara and Isleta have all bought or recovered lands in recent years.</P>

<P>In some cases, the tribes sought the properties for religious reasons or to protect religious sites, as in the case of Taos Pueblo's purchase of a ranch adjacent to the Blue Lake property.</P>

<P>Other purchases have been for economic development reasons, like Sandia's purchase of the Coronado Airport on North I-25.</P>

<P>If the tribes have the property declared Indian Trust Lands, the properties come off the tax rolls.</P>

<P>Depending on location, the tribes can also run into land use, access and zoning issues.</P>

<P>Sandia concluded a settlement in 2002 with homeowners and the federal government in its attempt to reclaim the west face of the Sandias. The agreement basically blocks development, protects existing homeowners and public access and secures Sandia's access to the land for religious observances.</P>

<P>Isleta Pueblo, meanwhile, is seeking to extend its immunity from civil lawsuits to property it has acquired off the reservation. Both the New Mexico Court of Appeals and Supreme Court have rejected the pueblo's argument, but the pueblo has asked for it to be reconsidered.</P>

<P>One tribal leader told the Journal that land acquisitions for religious reasons are high on many tribes' priority lists.</P>

<P>He suggested that tribes are more likely to be willing partners with local governments on lands acquired for economic development.</P>

<P>But properties obtained for religious reasons are likely to be closed off to the general population and lead to conflict.</P>

<P><B>Stitching a society</B></P>

<P>Bricks and mortar are one form of infrastructure.</P>

<P>Education and health are just as important.</P>

<P>Among New Mexico tribes, diabetes is considered an epidemic that leads to heart disease, kidney failure and amputations.</P>

<P>Nationwide, Native Americans are twice as likely to develop diabetes than non-Hispanic whites and amputation rates are three to four times higher among Indians than the general population, according to the American Diabetes Association.</P>

<img src="http://www.bluecorncomics.com/pics/isleta.jpg" align="right" width=500>
<P>Several tribes have built medical clinics and wellness centers to combat health problems like diabetes that have troubled their communities for years.</P>

<P>Isleta Pueblo set up programs to teach healthy lifestyles to children and adults in a recreation center that includes an Olympic-size pool. The tribe also provides diabetes education programs and a medical clinic.</P>

<P>The Mescalero Apache tribe built a full-service dialysis unit that serves tribal members and people in the surrounding community.</P>

<P>"We're able to combine Indian Heath Services and pueblo money to expand services to include an herbalist, physical therapist, a pharmacy, and counselors for substance abuse," Paisano said. "It's worked tremendously."</P>

<P>Many tribes offer college and high school scholarship programs, but Sandia's starts in the first grade.</P>

<P>"We will pay tuition for any child on the pueblo to attend any private school," Paisano said. "We also provide transportation. We require a commitment from the parents that they will help their children with homework and the students maintain their grades."</P>

<P>Most tribes now pay most of the cost of preschool programs, and have funded programs for the elderly and teens.</P>

<P>"We all look to how all our people can benefit from this (gaming)," said Santa Ana's Armijo.</P>

<P>"Where is the benefit to the tribe, is the first question we ask."</P>

<B>Casino brings prosperity back to Salamanca</P>

<P>Profits geared for growth; negatives are outweighed</B></P>

<P>One thing is indisputable: The casino has brought a prosperity unseen since the late 1800s and early 1900s, when Salamanca was a busy railroad hub and industrial center.</P>

<P>When it opened in May 2004, the casino brought nearly 1,000 new jobs to Cattaraugus County, about half the total number of jobs added over the previous 14 years. The new casino complex will employ 450 more workers, who are being hired now.</P>

<P>The Seneca Nation said the Allegany casino spent more than $14 million with local vendors and suppliers in its most recent fiscal year.</P>

<P>The casino generated $143.2 million in net revenue and $34.7 million in net income between September 2004 and 2005, according to nation filings with the federal government, and net gambling revenue for the six months ending March 31 was $69.9 million.</P>

<P>More than five million people have visited the casino, the nation says, with two-thirds coming from out of state, mostly Pennsylvania and Ohio.</P>

<P><B># County goes from poverty to prosperity</B></P>

<P>In 1985, Tunica County was the most impoverished county in the United States. The Rev. Jesse Jackson visited the area to draw attention to the substandard housing conditions along an open sewer, nicknamed Sugar Ditch.</P>

<P>The economy began to change in 1992 when Splash Casino became the first casino to open in Tunica County, population 9,227. Within five years, the number of residents receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children and food stamps had shrunk by half. In 1992, one in five Tunica County residents received a welfare check. Ten years later, it was one in 100.</P>

<P>Splash, which is now closed, was the first Mississippi casino to open along the Mississippi River. The county now has nine casinos, Tunica National Golf Course, Tunica RiverPark museum, an interactive, interpretive center that showcases the history of the Mississippi River, Mississippi's largest indoor arena, and an airport, now undergoing a $40 million capital improvement program.</P>

<P>The county has gone from 20 hotel rooms to 6,320. Year-to-date gross gaming revenues for Mississippi River casinos, the majority of which are in Tunica County, are about $730 million. Tunica's 31-story Gold Strike Casino Resort is the state's tallest building.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NatNews/message/45652">David Corcoran: &nbsp;Legalized gambling does relieve poverty</A></FONT></P>

<P>Opponents argue that expansion of this industry will attract undesirable underworld elements, increase crime, hurt taxpayers more by upping law enforcement costs, is immoral, and will do nothing to bolster the hosting community.</P>

<P>I can't see these dire and negative outcomes after witnessing what the gaming industries have done and are doing for people in both New Mexico and Wisconsin.</P>

<P>Some 20 years ago when visiting my brother and his family in New Mexico's native American country, I saw much poverty on the reservations: dilapidated housing, a lack of community and senior services, little promotion of local tourist landmarks, and, in general, a downtrodden and aimless Indian population.</P>

<P>They greeted us with 19th century attitudes of "We hate you" and "You're not welcome here."</P>

<P>But time and progress change all things. About 10 years ago, the Acoma and Laguna tribes built casinos containing the full range of table games and slot machines on their reservations. This economic development strategy has made a dramatic impact.</P>

<P>In July, traveling through those areas, I couldn't help but notice that the houses were now being kept in good repair and painted, several new housing developments had been added, new town and community centers were in evidence, a state-of-the-art museum had been constructed, infrastructure enhancements shone, and the people had jobs and money in their pockets.</P>

<P>These once economically depressed peoples were now prospering due to the establishment of money-generating casinos.</P>

<P>Most significantly and in a dramatic, full circle change-around from two decades ago, the Native Americans I came into contact with were now very respectful and considerate of us non-Indian tourists, welcoming us with open arms not only to the casinos, but also to their museums, landmarks, pueblos, and, yes, even into their churches.</P>

<P>I saw the same type of progress among the Native Americans in Wisconsin over the same time span.</P>

<P>With areas of Kanawha County and West Virginia suffering from poverty, joblessness, and hopelessness similar to what I once saw in New Mexico and Wisconsin years ago, it's surprising that some West Virginians aren't more open-minded to the benefits the gaming industry can bring to economically struggling regions.</P>

<P>And contrary to the gaming industry's opponents, on these native American reservations, there's no evidence that the purported vices attached to casinos and gambling actually exist.</P>

<P>The Herald-Leader's tour of a nearby city with a casino shows that gambling, like any industry, brings problems, and some residents still view Harrah's warily even after 15 years. But it is impossible to ignore economic benefits and effects a casino can have.</P>

<P>"If the casino left Metropolis, Metropolis would become a ghost town," said Dawn Teague, who grew up in the city and worked in Harrah's accounting department for five years before opening a Christian book and gift store downtown earlier this year.</P>

<P>"You would have so many people who would have to move away," she said.</P>

<P>Harrah's employs roughly 1,200 people, including those who work at the hotel adjacent to the casino. The establishment attracts 1.1 million visitors a year and generates $41 million for the state and $8.4 million for the city, according to the Illinois Casino Gaming Association.</P>

<P><B>Benefits to city</B></P>

<P>Metropolis' entire revenue structure has been turned upside down by the casino revenue, which replaced taxes on utilities.</P>

<P>Municipal buildings and roads are being rebuilt at a faster pace than officials thought possible. And the economy is stable, even if many of the town's other businesses aren't seeing much of an uptick in customers.</P>

Times Snohomish County Bureau</P>

<P>A study of Indian tribal economies in Washington state indicates tribes are investing casino income in new businesses and their own government services and, as a result, raising the economic prospects of their members and the surrounding communities.</P>

<P>The Tulalip Tribes' economy was one of four Indian economies profiled in the study by independent economist Jonathan Taylor for the Washington Indian Gaming Association.</P>

<P>The report, delivered last week to the 2006 Northwest Indian Gaming Conference in Tacoma, calculates that in 2004, tribal casinos and other Indian businesses generated more than $3.2 billion in revenue in the state and employed 13,146 people, about 4,000 of them Indians.</P>

<P>Locally, the Tulalips' 2005 taxable sales rose to $311 million, yielding $26 million in taxes for the state, the report says.</P>

Like any big subject, the effects of gaming are too complex to capture in any one analysis.  Researchers can find almost any conclusion they want by choosing the definitions, conditions, and variables for their studies.  About all one can say is that casinos have roughly the same effect as any business of a comparable size.  Like similar businesses, the results are mixed.</P>

<img src="http://www.bluecorncomics.com/pics/gaming3.jpg" align="right">
<P>An article titled "Influence of Casinos Debatable" in the Contra Costa Times, 10/24/04, presents an overview of the research and notes the conflicting conclusions:</P>

<DIR>
<P>[R]esearch abounds from Atlantic City to Palm Springs, with a range of results suggesting that much depends on the local community, the gambling market and who you ask.</P>

<P><B>Crime</B></P>

<P>Even using the same federal data, scholars can't seem to agree on a link between casinos and criminals.</P>

<P><B>Boost or bust?</B></P>

<P>Success stories abound, particularly in downtrodden backwaters that added casinos. Several communities found hotel industry growth, new construction and cash for local government, a study by the National Opinion Research Council found.</P>

<P><B>Problem gambling</B></P>

<P>Several studies suggest that about three percent of American adults are pathological or problem gamblers  about 1 million Californians.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Study finds casinos would have modest impact on state's economy</FONT></P>

<P>By JULIE MEHEGAN, Sun Statehouse Bureau</P>

<P>BOSTON The introduction of Las Vegas-style casinos to the Bay State would bring modest gains in jobs and home prices, lead to slightly higher bankruptcy rates and reported crimes, but would have "surprisingly little impact" on the economy and crime in Massachusetts overall, according to a study being released today.</P>

<P>"Compared to the sometimes overheated rhetoric around the issue, our results were flaming moderate on this," said Phineas Baxandall, assistant director of the Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston and co-author of the study, titled "Betting on the Future: The Economic Impacts of Legalized Gambling."</P>

<P>Baxandall and his co-author, Dartmouth College economics professor Bruce Sacerdote, began their research after talking to policy-makers about the need for unbiased data on the effect casinos might have on the Massachusetts economy.</P>

<P>Gambling supporters have long argued that expanded gaming would be a financial windfall for the Bay State. As the economy nose-dived in recent years, the call grew louder for casinos and slot machines to help replenish the state's coffers.</P>

<P>But opponents say the social costs associated with excessive gambling and the financial burden on communities that host casinos would blunt any possible financial reward.</P>

<P>According to the results of the study, neither scenario is entirely accurate.</P>

<P>Researchers examined counties in the United States that have casinos and counties that do not, focusing on employment rates, home prices, bankruptcies, crime, revenue and spending.</P>

<P>Among the findings:</P>

<img src="http://www.bluecorncomics.com/pics/brinton.jpg" align="right">
<P>There was no significant difference in total government revenues and expenditures per capita in areas where casinos opened in the 1980s and 1990s compared to noncasino areas.</P>

<P>Per-capita spending and revenues declined slightly in areas with casinos, attributed to population increases.</P>

<P>While more total jobs were created in casino counties, the population in those counties also grew, resulting in little change in employment rates.</P>

<P>Median home prices in casino counties increased by about $6,000 over noncasino counties.</P>

<P>Personal bankruptcy rates in casino counties are about 10 percent higher (3.27 bankruptcies per 1,000 people) than in non-casino counties (2.98 per 1,000).</P>

<P>Total reported crimes increased slightly in casino counties, but only because of population increases. Overall crime rates actually declined.</P>

<P>"These results suggest that economic, fiscal or public safety factors are insufficient to either deny or invite casinos into Massachusetts," Baxandall and Sacerdote wrote, suggesting policy-makers consider "less quantitative factors" when debating casinos, such as whether they would alter the state's character.</P>

<P>Casino bills have been filed in every legislative session for at least a decade. Facing a lack of votes, a group of senators withdrew a proposal in 2003 that would have allowed two casinos and slot machines at the state's racetracks. The House rejected a similar proposal in 2002.</P>

<P>But lawmakers who support casino gambling continue their efforts. Several gambling bills are scheduled to be taken up in the session that began this month, including one that would allow two Indian casinos and slot machines at the tracks.</P>

<P>Massachusetts is one of only 14 states that does not allow either casinos or slot machines.</P>

<P><A NAME="attacks"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=+1>What the attacks on Indian gaming tell us</font></A><br>
As I often say, an Indian casino-hotel seems no better or worse than any other big businesse.g., a Wal-Mart.  People often protest the incursion of Wal-Marts, but they never say things like, "Those greedy white people are destroying our way of life."  Race is never an issue, even though 99% of American corporations are owned or run by whites.</P>

<P>Nor do people carry on about the white-run casinos, card clubs, racetracks, and lotteries in their midst.  Only Indian-run businesses receive their scorn.  Hence the suspicion that this enmity is driven by racism:  the fear and hatred of anyone who's different.</P>

<P>The following articles are essential reading on the subject.  Some excerpts:</P>

<P><B>His Attack Ads Involving Indian Gaming, and Their Larger Context and Significance</B></P>

<P>By EDWARD LAZARUS</P>

<P>Of course, it is hardly news when a political candidate -- such as Schwarzenegger, in this case -- dispenses with accuracy when going for his opponent's political jugular. However, what is news, I think, is the amazing transformation in the attitude of Californians towards the state's Indian population.</P>

<P>Only a few years ago, Californians were so taken with the idea of "fairness to Indians" that they decisively approved the initiative I mentioned above, allowing nearly unfettered Indian gaming. But now, thanks to the incredible success of tribal casinos, Indian tribes have been transformed in the public consciousness from victims of historical oppression into just another grasping, corrupting special interest group.</P>

<P>Indeed, if Schwarzenegger's decision as to what group to target is any test, Indian tribes may even have surpassed unions and corporate fat cats to become the very worst possible example of such a group.</P>

<P><B>Growing anti-Indian movements threaten to destroy
many of the gains that Indian country has made</P>

<P>COMMENTARY<br>
Updated: 5:28 p.m. ET Nov. 16, 2004</B></P>

<P>In America circa 2004 public metaphor is everything. One Nation and other groups that need someone to attack, joined to the politicians of various states, are now onto something: The power of the Indian image in the American mind can perhaps be damaged and reversed: From legitimate governments comprised of the first peoples and rightful property owners of this land, to greedy, special-interest casino kingpins. Say it and portray the seedy image enough times, it becomes the over-riding public metaphor, one that will last a long time. The antagonist idea is to denigrate Indian jurisdiction in the public mind, paint the American Indian as getting a free ride, as conniving and thievish, and you can get a measure passed against them!<br>
<B>.</B><br>

While Indian enemies envision the complete deconstruction of Indian sovereign bases, the fight over Congress and by extension, over the hearts and minds of the American public, becomes paramount. Remember John Kerry's "flip-flop" image, how, true or not, it stuck. Again, that was just a tactic. The damage was done through a public relations strategy built on repeated innuendo. The same is happening to Indian issues. It is not fair and follows no logic but manipulates anger and intends to diminish any gains by Native tribes. Thus the push is on to portray the tribes as lobbying nightmares, enclaves of values-less societies rolling in ill-gained casino dollars. This is cultural preparation for the political kill. It's the swift-boat attack of the Indian issue polemic: Indians as "rip-offs," "cheats," corrupt lobbyists, as "special interests," as impediments to American unity. The only thing in the way is that pesky American Indian sovereignty and "properties" over which these phony governments exercise control.</P>
</DIR>

<P>In other words, look out, Indians.  Mainstream America is still gunning for you.</P>

From <A HREF="http://www.socialistworker.org/2006-1/573/573_04_Robideau.shtml">American Indian Movement Activist on the Abramoff Scandal: &nbsp;"One of many racists out to defraud Native tribes"</A> by Robert Robideau:</P>

<DIR>
<P>Governmental reports alleging that gaming revenue has been used to "reduce poverty and unemployment rates, build schools and hospitals, paved road and construct sewer systems, preserve and revitalize cultural traditions and build responsive and responsible government institutions such as tribal courts" are a smokescreen for the United States to escape its treaty obligations.</P>

<P>If these treaties had been honored decades ago, the Native American communities would have enjoyed the same opportunities and the same standard of living as mainstream America.</P>

<P>'Nuff said.</P>
