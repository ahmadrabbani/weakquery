It's a conscious decision by many city-based families. So why are more parents turning their back on the traditional education system? And is home schooling a valid alternative to schools?  Comments (76) Add your comment   Mark Cramer : 02 Aug 2010 7:41:29pm I am amazed at the ignorance of some of the anti-home schooling comments. Obviously you have never actually met any home schooled kids, they are invariably better socialised than their schooled peers, as nearly all HS kids engage in a far wider variety of activities. Academic results for HS children on average are far higher than schooled children, and several universities have stated preferences for HS kids in their admission manuals as they are normally better socialised and more able to start university level study without the hand holding that schooled children require. Reply  Alert moderator     Kate : 23 Jul 2010 1:49:18am MMMMMMmmmmm.... I am homeschooling Mum of Teenager who participates in lots-Local Orchestra, Sailing, Weekly community service, etc etc. No Locking away here!  Different Folks/ Different strokes. We all learn in various ways so why not have a variety of Education "styles"/possibilites to suit our diversity as Humans & learners? Schools suit some while homeschooling let other personalities thrive & sometimes these experiences are combined to suit different needs at different stages of a childs development. MMMMMMmmmmmm..... Reply  Alert moderator     Sue : 09 Jun 2010 5:57:53pm Comment EMPHASIS:  TWO DIFFERENT TEENAGERS: One being in a home-based learning environment AND one being in a schooling environment. THEIR REASONS: 1. My low key son wanted his life back. The schooling environment did not feel compatible with his nature. Based at home, his learning feels freer to be more individualised, relevant and creatively fulfilling. He thrives in having time feel like his own and that his days feel relaxed and homely. He has a strong need to feel like he is being true to himself and that his days feel more organic in nature and less structured. He has a strong sense of whole-life purpose and tremendous passion for his unique interests. 2. My vivacious daughter wanted to dive into the kind of life offered by a private girl's schooling environment. She loves being part of 'where it's happening' socially. She thrives in a more linear and sequential living and learning environment. She plans to be a delightful primary school teacher.   Reply  Alert moderator     KM : 06 Jun 2010 2:26:09pm I am in my fifties and was home educated (unschooled) for many of my younger years. I tried school for a while and found it dreadfully stifling amongst other things. I have done just about everything and anything I have wanted to do in my life; not going to school has not restricted me one little bit. Reply  Alert moderator     Diane : 06 Jun 2010 1:08:33pm I have home-schooled both my children for 10 years, and they are studying at university. Having spent all that time and more for my children, I am now battling to enter the workforce, despite enough experience and certificates. I seem to be stuck between a rock (ageism) and a hard place (home-schooling sound dodgy for many HR officers). My daughter asked me if I regretted spending so much time for educating my kids. My answer: if I had the choice again, I would do exactly the same thing, despite my present problems!  My children, regardless of academic results, have learnt so much more during those years: they have developed into responsible, sensitive and sensible young adults, able to listen to others and feel empathy, qualities that are disappearing fast in an ever-growing egocentric society. Reply  Alert moderator     Sophie : 04 Jun 2010 3:33:21pm Hello. I am a nine year old homeschool girl. I love homeschooling. It is fun. I get to see a lot of other homeschool kids my age and it allows me to have quite a bit of freedom. I don't really need to do any school work unless something comes up in my day to day life. My day is kind of like a school kid's day I get up, get dressed, have breakfast etc, etc, etc, but I just don't have any school. Quite a few people would freak out at the thought of homeschooling, but my mum knew about it before I was born so she considered it as something she would do. So now I have a life where I can do almost anything I want to do. It's great. Reply  Alert moderator     Martin (1) : 02 Jun 2010 10:30:22pm The main reason Christians home school their children, is so that their faith in God is not compromised by alternative teaching and humanistic theology.  Lets face it, evolution is a faith itself and taught as factual science in our schools. True science must be provable and be witnessed before it can be taught as fact. Which science do you want taught? 30 million years ago, 50 million years ago,120 million years ago ,2 billion years ago they all have different conclusions and different beginnings. One must have a great faith to believe in something so inconsistent. The only outcome for the student taught such conflicting evidence is one of confusion. Let the parents and students themselves have the elective right to choose what they want their children to be taught in our schools. Why should any government or any indivdual have the right to enforce upon us what they believe. I am a Christian by choice and others have the freedom to choose what they wish to believe in our great nation. We should never undermine this value. It should be choice.. Our constitution and rights to freedom will be comprimised if we allow this National Curriculum to be implimented by this current government. Ask yourself what freedom will be taken away next? Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Budhists,Humanists and Atheists should all have the freedom to practice their faith (within the laws of our land). To do other creates a great resentment in our society and leads to urban unrest.  Reply  Alert moderator     steve : 02 Jun 2010 10:30:21pm We started homeschooling when my daughter was in year1. She had a reading age well above her grade level and the school was unable to stretch her reading ability. All went well until we notified the ed department. My daughter had to be in school, she was in school, just not the conventional type. The disagreement continued until eventually an inspector was sent. Approval was given based on the paperwork my wife prepared. The inspector was going to leave without even seeing my childs work. I had to make her walk around the room viewing her work as it was set up like a schoolroom at the time. We had a philosophy of education. A well bound formalised document on our beliefs of education. We never refered to it, excpt on one occassion. During an inspection, my wife was stumped at answering a question, so I said that is covered in our philosphy. 'This is great', tick tick tick, no question of whether we were teaching or the child learing. Our current Premier, who was education minister at the time, wanted to change the education act. The definition of a parent was someone who had (a)the day to day care of the child and (b)long term care welfare of the child except for home schoolers where only part (a) applies. To me this implies the state has te long term responsibility for the child and that is not part of my philosphy. We no longer have inspections. I put my daughter into y10 for the first time. She got a straight A average. Y11 was difficult for her with many hours of after school learning. My second daughter saw what happened and vowed not to go there. She put herself through Y12 and is at university. My son went to TAFE at Y11 and is about to complete his diploma. He has a maturity well above his 17 years, takes a proactive part in his sports club, undertaking all the clubs junior umpiring co-ordination. After 20years of home schooling, I have 1 child left in Y9.  Would I recommend homeschooling - No It is a large commitment to the family, in time and resources. It takes commitment - an awful lot of it. Have the children and the family benefitted - yes and I have seen other homeschoolig children change when deschooled. We have had to work through all the issues that have confronted us as parents, teachers, schoolars and children.  Because of my choice to forego inspections, any subsidy was also foregone. It is not cheap. But I believe in good material and the children have benefited. What suited 1 child may not have suited the next. It was about understanding each childs needs and development. Reply  Alert moderator   Nalin : 04 Jun 2010 7:15:55am Steve, your story is inspirational, even though you would not recommend homeschooling. I am passionate about my child's education, about her whole life, and am prepared to try to undertake the awesome task. It's hearing the stories of people like you, who's children are older and have moved through into adult life (or well on the way) that shines light on the path. Thank you for sharing your story. Reply  Alert moderator        Dona : 02 Jun 2010 6:17:10pm Please AT, can you devise a system where callers are not treated to waiting on the phone(25 mins), only to be told time has run out...a homeschooler mentioned her battery was running out! Now onto the topic, thank goodness for all these great and varied posts espousing the virtues of homeschooling/learning. Others who knocked it were speaking not out of experience but ignorance. Coming from a teaching background as with another in our 'Natural Learning' group, it was a huge transition to allow my youngster to do his own thing. My role as facillitator has proved to be conjucive to his learning. We did the school thing for three terms. I am totally happy we had this option. He is happy too! He loves his freinds and we love our freedom! The down side, money is tight! As we are saving the government dollars,(teachers, resources, transport...) it would be nice to get a little financial assistance. I really feel though it is the kids that need to be asked for the mainstream society to gauge what home learning is all about. Reply  Alert moderator     Jo : 02 Jun 2010 11:15:37am Social skills is a bit of an old chestnut upon which supporters of the status quo always fall. My children this week have spent time with a group of visiting senior citizens (Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal), a scientist who was looking at algae down a microscope with them, two people setting up an experience for university students...I could go on at some length (it's only Tuesday but it's been a busy week), but homeschooling children are in general exposed to a greater diversity of adults in daily life than children in classrooms. Reply  Alert moderator     Bad call : 02 Jun 2010 10:06:51am I wish I had home-schooled my children instead of sending them to school 30 years ago when we arrived in Australia from Ireland. Both my children were subjected to ridicule by both teaching staff and other children while all the time being lectured about the UN Articles on the Rights of the Child and the value of a multicultural society. The teachers did not practice what they preached. They were not very well educated themselves and had a limited world view. At the time teaching was the occupation of choice of those with the lowest high school scores. One of my children is very bright but has a physical disabilty and was taunted unmercifully at school. The teachers did not intervene on the grounds it would "toughen him up." He was deemed "too gentle" for his own good. Neither child attained university level qualifications which my husband and I both hold from Irish universities.  Both childen are male and this was not a good thing to be either at the time. We tried public and then private schools but the problem stemmed from social attitudes which my children were too young to comprehend or deal with. Their best experiences were at kindergarten, but it was downhill all the way after that. Reply  Alert moderator     lilywhite : 02 Jun 2010 9:37:13am Just curious - question I want to ask is: were historical bright sparks such as Einstein, Edison, Galileo the products of home schooling? Jessica Watson has shown single mindedness of a high achiever, no doubt nurtured by minimal outside distractions of home schooling. Do home schooling nurture and encourage the geniuses amongst us?  Reply  Alert moderator   Guy : 02 Jun 2010 5:58:50pm Hi Lily, Yes, many very successful, brilliant and well known people have been homeschooled.

Our 15 year old daughter attends a govt school and has little desire to be homeschooled, our 12 year old son is in his second year of homeschooling and is enjoying it much more than school. Either can change to the other type of education if they want.  As other contributors have in effect pointed out, "home schooling" is basically a misnomer, because it can be very flexible. It doesn't have to be at home and the learning doesn't have to come from schooling. It can be broader and more opportunistic than that- eg topics that are of interest can be looked into to a greater extent. In my experience, the home schooling community is broad minded and respectful of people's differences. I think that evaluating home schooling inevitably leads to assessing school education too. Schools vary a lot and I'm sure that some are much better than others at educating our children and young adults in a stimulating, imaginative and personal way. Some schools have a lot more children with challenging behaviours and attitudes than others. People vary a lot in other ways too! Some children will thrive at school, others are not well suited to the routines, distractions, peer group pressure, etc. Teachers vary a lot. I have a lot of respect for some I've known, due to their energy, commitment and care. Some other teachers appear to have comparitively more limited skills and aspirations.  I think that teaching is more likely to be a stressful profession for a teacher of one or more classes of say 25 children than it is for a home schooling parent of one to several children.  In general, I want my children to be happy and confident, to be interested in learning and to have a balanced interest in themselves and others. When it's all said and done, I probably don't mind whether it's home or school education that is involved.  But if I had my time again, I would consider home schooling both my children from an early stage. There seem to be more opportunities for them to grow and develop.. Reply  Alert moderator     Deb : 01 Jun 2010 10:31:27pm A fascinating topic on Australia Talks tonight - just wanted to respond to a couple of points. One caller said bullying in mainstream schooling helped kids prepare themselves for bullying in the workplace. If mainstream schooling is linked to bullying behaviour, then maybe we could prevent the transfer of so many bullies from schools to the workplace by home schooling more kids? However, I also agreed that some kids are at risk of falling through the cracks of our social system if they are kept within the confines of home within an abusive or unhealthy family environment, without anybody on the outside to notice the signs. Reply  Alert moderator   Anna : 03 Jun 2010 8:42:10am As a long-term home educator, like Deb I have concerns about the children who 'slip through the cracks', being 'educated at home' as a guise for some form of abuse. Of course, school attendance does not preclude children from being subjected to abuse, either at school or at home. The registration process, which includes a visit from an Authorised Person from the Department of Education, goes some way to ensuring that children are genuinely receiving a high quality education at home. Registration is not granted if progress in the child's education cannot be demonstrated as well as documented. The Authorised Personnel are 'mandated reporters' and trained to be alert for signs of abuse. The other safeguard is encouragement for all home educators to participate in local groups, where parents and children socialise together. Most home educators lead very active community lives, participating in group activities on a regular basis, some purely social, some educational, and this forms a vital part of their overall home education experience. When families do not participate in anything outside the home, that can indeed flag cause for concern. Generally speaking, home educated families lead busy, active, interactive lives. Those who do have nothing to fear from authorities, and are truly benefiting their children, giving them opportunities and skills beyond what they system can provide. Reply  Alert moderator     Terry Harding : 03 Jun 2010 1:40:33pm I agree with your comments. It is important to distinguish between children teasing each other, which is going to happen occasionally in their social interactions, including in our families; and the debilitating phenomenon of bullying. No person should have to endure such victimisation. Schools are seeking to deal with bullying, as they develop policies and train staff and students in appropriate procedures and behaviours. However, it is very difficult for even the best intentioned school administrators to be aware of, much less control this terrible behaviour. Justice Roslyn Atkinson stated in 2002 that school bullying would develop into a litigious mine-field. I think that she was right.  I am glad parents are empowered by home education to protect their children from this needless blight. Reply  Alert moderator        Cindy : 01 Jun 2010 10:24:23pm I have 5 children, 4 are homeschooled currently, soon to be 5. All are special needs. At school they were bullied, spent most of the school time ignored by teachers or on the floor tantying from stress.  They now spend at least one day a week out at a CSIRO lab/Zoo classes/biodiversity/museums and other various classes. They have an art teacher come to do specialised art. They have so much more now than they ever did at school, and they have someone who is willing to spend the time ensuring that they DO learn and are not just "left". My boys spend a great deal of time with other children and also adults, both in classes and out of classes. At school my children learnt that the teacher never had the time, that other children took great delight in teasing them. They learnt nothing other than I was forcing them to go to somewhere they hated every day. We are all happier now. I love spending everyday with my boys and educating them! Reply  Alert moderator     Yeshe : 01 Jun 2010 10:15:55pm Another homeschooler added to the mix! I must admit that I turned off the radio as soon as the dissenter voiced that homeschooled children don't have the opportunities for further education and have trouble gaining employment. This is a completely unfounded statement and I would like some evidence for this. I would also like some evidence to prove that school and only school can provide a well-rounded education.  I would like to remind those who consider the 13 years of school then 3+ years of university that there are many ways of gaining entry into employment and further education including TAFE, mature age university entry, apprenticeship and private schools.  I would also like to see some statistics on how many schooled children know what they want to do when they leave school compared to homeschooled children. I would be surprised if homeschooled children weren't more sure of their place in the world. There is evidence about the socialization of homeschooled children, their academic abilities and their ability to contribute to society - get a group of 50 homeschool families together and see it for yourself. Really these debates are pointless.  As for religious brainwashing, this is an antiquated view of homeschooling from the 1970's, most modern homeschoolers are average middle class people who simply have an interest in providing their children with a happy childhood experience rather than memories of bullies, humiliation from teachers, hours of boredom and years spent learning things that have no use in "real" life. I am not a university graduate, but I have experienced that many teachers are not overly qualified to teach children either. When I did my HSC in 1997 to gain entry into a BA and then Dip Ed one only needed a TER of 55, and yet a social worker needed a TER of 75. hmmmm.  Reply  Alert moderator     Judy : 01 Jun 2010 9:00:29pm Sending children to school in order to prepare them to cope with the negative experiences they will experience as adults in "the real world" (whatever that is)makes little sense. What all adults need in order to lead fulfilling and meaningful lives, and to cope with the difficuties that life will inevitably throw in their path, are things like self knowledge and acceptance, self esteem, confidence in their own abilities, faith in themselves, and respect for themselves and others. Some parents come to the conclusion that their chldren have a better chance of developing these personal attributes if the bulk of their time from the age of 5 to the age of 18 is not spent in the institution we call school. Education and schooling are not the same thing.  Reply  Alert moderator   Jan : 16 Jun 2010 1:50:08pm Judy, I really like the way you've expressed the idea that our children wouldn't have to deal with 'real life bullies' if more of them were homeschooled. Wouldn't it be a lovely world if more young future adults were taught how to be loving, tolerant and inclusive towards others? With more and more parents chosing to homeschool and teach good values, the schools will soon be left with the kids who have behavioural issues (which could possibly stem from the home) and are at risk of replicating in future generations. How scary does that sound? I took my 2 girls out of a reputable private school just over a year ago primarily because I didn't think they were learning (they were prone to being distracted). But what I didn't think about at the time was the horrible attitude that was being reinforced in my 10yo each and every day at school by the other 'cliquey' girls in her class. It's so lovely to have my beautiful daughter back again and leave that 'attitude' behind!  We now have even more play dates with friends (some still at school and some who are homeschooled) who's parents have similar values, so my girls now get hours of uninterupted play time with other lovely kids. Homeschooling is certainly a challenge, but the rewards are enormous! Reply  Alert moderator        Ruth : 01 Jun 2010 8:02:26pm It is encouraging to hear so many positive reports from other homeschoolers, however, I don't understand why so many people value marks, scores, diplomas and degrees so highly. Why can't it be about bringing up a person to be the best that they can be, to contribute to our society in a positive way, to be a "successful" person regardless of their academic accomplishments? I would like to think that when I've finished educating my children, they will have the skills and abilities to choose pathways in life where they will be able to shine, that whatever they do (whether it requires a degree or not), they will be a blessing to the people around them. Reply  Alert moderator     Allen W. Collins : 01 Jun 2010 7:59:22pm I wish togive another view of the home Schooling debate, that from a 75 year old grandfather. My wife and Iare both now in our seventies and when we were educated we both passed the Leaving Certificate. When we married and had our three children our main mission in life was to provide the highest possible education for our children, all attended Private Schools in Sydney. So when our grand children arrived we hoped that this high level of education would be up held. However one of our children opted for home schooling ,schooling all five [5]of her children , one now finished going onto higher education without the slightest problem, now working in a veterinary surgery in Sydey All others are progressing through the years and all doing extremely well. I over the years have monitored these children, just to make sure in my mind that thier education is of a high standard, and i can assure you it is just that exremely high. A number of people think that Home Schooling is just, children in isolation sitting around a table, well let me assure you that is far from the truth, these children have a highly constructed circle that meets on a regular basis adding to the fullness and enrichness of that home schooling ..yes to my daughter and her family this is huge success and for one who prizes education as the no one theme for children, it has worked out exremely well fot this family.  Reply  Alert moderator   Marina : 01 Jun 2010 9:17:02pm Indeed! Thank you so much for sharing the journey of your views on education. As of only a few years ago there were at least a half dozen of the more prestigious universities around Australia, including MIT, who acknoweldged actively seeking applications from homeschooled students for entry into their campuses - such is the high academic standard, ability to be self-directed (without having to be spoon fed and instructed every step of the way), and their willingness to actually 'ask' questions and contact lecturers without hesitation. Indeed, I was quite shocked to discover that many universities have recently introduced a 'bridging' course for school leavers so that they can be taught how to study, how to write reports, and to ensure that their reading/English/maths standards are of the bare minimum required to even begin a university course! A penny to a pound there are no homeschoolers in that lot. Reply  Alert moderator   Terry Harding : 03 Jun 2010 1:53:37pm I have researched 438 home educated graduates from Australian Christian Academy and from Australian Christian College, in all states and territories. 36% entered Bachelor courses 21% entered Diploma courses 45% entered Apprenticeships, Traineeships and Certificate courses. Tertiary entrance was not a problem for my 5 children. Reply  Alert moderator     Jan : 16 Jun 2010 2:00:19pm Marina, I know a young girl who has entered University this year wanting to study to become an English Teacher. As a homeschool mum (of just over a year) of two girls in grades 3 & 5 I asked her questions pertaining to some of the grammar we were studying. I was disappointed to hear her say that she didn't know very much grammar, only the basic things, but would be taught it at Uni! And worse still, she's not even doing a bridging course!! Reply  Alert moderator           David : 01 Jun 2010 7:43:10pm Nearly all of the concerns raised about home schooling tonight are things I raised myself when my wife first suggested the idea for our two boys. These common concerns stem largely from ignorance, and years of indoctrination that the system that most of us went through must be the best. It’s the same old argument you get when you ask private schooled people if they think private education is better than public. It took me several years to accept that the private school my children were attending was providing an inadequate education, and decided to take the plunge and give home schooling a go. In a very short space of time it became obvious that all of my reservations were unfounded, and home schooling produced an acceleration in their learning that I never would have anticipated. Home schooling may not be for everyone (we took a big drop in income to do it), but in my experience the vast majority of home schoolers are doing better at home than they were in the main stream system. Feel free to raise your concerns and ask questions, but please don’t make uninformed statements unless you have actually made a serious attempt to learn about what really goes on. By the way, our boys are currently both back in the public system and doing very well, but we all enjoy the security of knowing that home schooling is an option that we can call on at any time should we all feel it is the right thing to do.  Reply  Alert moderator     Patrick O'Sullivan : 01 Jun 2010 7:17:39pm While I can see benefits for home schooling I do support and prefer mainstream education for the breadth and socialising benefits. I also teach my children in conjunction with mainstream teaching and see no need to expect mainstream to be able to teach everything. There are always issues with both approaches. One issue I have with one aspect of home schooling is from those with literal religious belief who ... who do not allow their children to learn about the natural world; reject evolution without which you cannot understand modern medicine, fight against physical sciences because it clashes with their young earth view and therefore deny their children right to think for themselves. Reply  Alert moderator   Marina : 01 Jun 2010 8:05:35pm I understand your concerns, however research (and I could find a web-link if I tried hard enough) shows that only about 17% of parents choose home education because of a religious reason. As to the THEORY of evolution (as it's still only a THEORY), many home educators who teach creationism also teach about the THEORY of evolution as a comparative study, and also teach of the how various animal species have adapted over time to suit their environments, etc. The proportion of the 17% of home educators who also teach creationism, and also to the exclusion of the THEORY of evolution, would actually be quite tiny (my opinion, not the result of any quotable statistics). Reply  Alert moderator   Fiona J : 01 Jun 2010 9:49:46pm Funnily enough one of the (many) reasons I chose to homeschool my two boys is that, being an atheist, I was concerned that all Brisbane private schools, bar two grammar schools, are christian based and I didn't want my children being 'indoctrinated' with such views.  I have opted to give my children a secular education and while we study religion for interest (and to allow us to respect people with different belief systems)the theories of evolution and survival of the fittest are big winners in our family! The home education community is just like wider society, we have groups for Christians, we have secular groups and we have groups where we all happily mix. In fact I belong to groups representing all three. Okay I joined the christian group by mistake but none of the members seem to mind me being there ;-) Reply  Alert moderator     Gordon Campbell : 07 Jun 2010 3:20:06pm We had some concerns about the THEORY of gravity as well, so we make sure our kids also learn about the THEORY of Intelligent Falling. We also teach alternatives to the THEORY of tectonic plates (maybe it's just one plate -- on the back of a turtle),and the heliocentric THEORY (whatever that is). As for the germ THEORY of disease, we like to tell them that disease is actually caused by tiny invisible micro-organisms. These are called evil spirits. Reply  Alert moderator        shell : 05 Jun 2010 9:08:58pm Hi Patrick (and others)  Do you know, personally know, any people, with a "literal religious belief"? Or are your comments pure speculation? I suggest the latter. I am a Christian home-educator myself, one who believes in young earth/creationism and let me assure you; the hours of study, discussion and research gone into our understanding of how the earth was formed can hardly be seen as not allowing our children to think for themselves. In fact at school, children are given information about many many things, (not just evolution, but also this) as pure fact, without even mentioning that it is only one of many theories on the origin of earth. Evolution is only a theory, as is creationism, and all other thoughts on the formation of the earth! My children (and many other h/sers) get to look at all theories, both of origins of earth, religions, cultures etc, they get to discuss, ask questions, rationalise and come to a conclusion as to what they believe is correct, of course my beliefs play a part in their outcomes, but so do a teacher's. You probably don't even know what your teacher's beliefs are on most things, but they are persuading their students into their way of thinking, perhaps without even knowing it.  My children have many friends who are involved in all aspects of 'schooling'; private, public, christian-private and home, and without a doubt the ones with the most broad knowledge and understanding of the many theories of origin are the home-educated, Christian or not makes no difference, most of them can hold educated discussions referring to beliefs from both sides of the arguments, defending and justifying why they believe what they do, all while understanding that they are infact a theory.

Anyway, Christians and non-Christians alike should read a book by Andrew Parker, called "The Genesis Enigma", which argues that the first page of the bible actually describes the creation of everything, and also, Evolution is true! VERY INTERESTING. The author is a respected scientist. Reply  Alert moderator        Yvette : 14 Jul 2010 1:17:16pm Hi Patrick, where is your evidence that if you reject evolution you cannot understand modern medicine. As a registered nurse/midwife I find this claim confusing. Do all people who reject evolution also reject an old earth theory? Maybe you should research your claims before you make them. This is something I am teaching my homeschooled children to do: have hard evidence to back claims and research all sides to an argument. Maybe you would have benefited from a homeschool education. Reply  Alert moderator        Rachel : 01 Jun 2010 7:17:01pm I was a natural learner all the way through from year 1 to year 12. For me, home-education was all about freedom; the freedom and time to pursue my interests, explore ideas and interact with a very wide range of people. I spent a lot of time out in the community, playing sports, volunteering and socializing with people of all ages.  I don't have much against school except that it leaves so little time for anything else. As a child and young adult there were so many things I wanted to learn and explore, there just didn't seem to be time for school.  Reply  Alert moderator   JH : 02 Jun 2010 11:29:01am I love your comment, Rachel. My young children feel the same way and give the same answer when asked would they like to try school - "We don't have time for school - there's so much else to do!" Far from being cloistered at home, they enjoy a very wide range of social and educational experiences. I think if the term "cloistered" is to be used in this debate, it is to be used in reference to those within the school grounds - seen and not heard while the adults of our society go about the serious business of life without interruption from little people. As another comment pointed out, schooling and educating are very different concepts. We don't like the term "home schooling", but rather think of ourselves as taking full responsibility for the raising (not just educating) of our children either by being available to facilitate their learning ourselves or by calling on passionate, interested, inspiring and nurturing adults in the community to step in where we lack the specific skills or knowledge necessary. Quite apart from all the philosophical reasons for choosing this lifestyle, it is just plain fun! This concept, I think, is probably the most difficult for many people to grasp..... Reply  Alert moderator   KC : 03 Aug 2010 8:14:26pm Just picking up on the comment about children cloistered within the school grounds: with the coming of large, spike fences around schools in NSW, my own home educated children look sadly at their peers in 'kiddy jail' as we drive past on our way to cello lessons, quilting class, art class, karate, basketball, shakespeare plays....you get the idea. Reply  Alert moderator           Jan : 01 Jun 2010 7:14:49pm I wish, wish, wish I could have been home schooled, but it was impossible with my war widow mother forced to go out to work and always exhausted, and only my grandfather to help a bit - neither sufficiently educated to home school me beyond about year two. I hated school with a passion. I was quiet, withdrawn and very anxious and neurotic. The kids at school formed cliques and teased me. I hated gym and sport especially and was no good at either. My social life at church and with children living around my home were the only things which saved me. To learn in peace and, after learning the basics, not be forced to constantly play sport for years, but to be able exercise by walking, would have been heaven to me. I KNOW I would have done MUCH BETTER without the competition and social problems of school causing me to have a severe neurotosis throughout my grammar school years, causing my school work to suffer a great deal. Regarding tertiary education, the open university is a possibility if going to the others does not work. Yes, there are social issues in the workplace but not anywhere near the misery of school, even in recent years when work has become more competitive with shortage of jobs. Reply  Alert moderator     Lisa Holley : 01 Jun 2010 7:11:44pm I have been surprised at the lack of evidence based research that the two Professors based their opinions on. It seems that all those against have not homeschooled themselves. I am not religious and have homeschooled my children, they also attended a Steiner school and are currently attending a public high school. The book by New York teacher of the year, John Gatto "Dumbing us Down' provides interesting evidence about schooling. As the last caller said - most homeschooling parents I met (at least 80%) were teachers. Our homeschooling group had muslims, christains and atheists - probably a much greater cross section of the community than most children in a christain school would ever come across.   Reply  Alert moderator   Yvette : 14 Jul 2010 8:11:48pm I agree Lisa.  I was especially amazed at the poor response by Pat Noller.

My usual reply is "oh boy I sometimes wish we had less of it, between ballet, gym, music group, swimming and all the playdates and group meets we sometimes wish we could have more time at home!" Why people think children can only socialise if they go to school baffles me! Reply  Alert moderator   Jan : 16 Jun 2010 2:46:12pm Regarding 'socialisation'.  As a h/s mum of 2 girls, 8 & 10, I now educate other people about 'socialisation'.  When my girls were at school, they learnt to how to be nasty, exclusive, and to come home with horrible attitudes, just to name a few.  As h/schoolers they are learning tolerance, manners, how to include everyone, to love their sister, and to talk to their dad, and others, about what they learned in their lessons - which is something they NEVER did whilst at school (because they had a horrible attitude when they came home). Kids learn how to socialise from adults and other nice people, they only practise it with their friends! Reply  Alert moderator   KC : 03 Aug 2010 8:17:11pm Yes - I have often wondered what wonderful social behaviours my child will learn from spending 30 hours every week with children of the same age?! Reply  Alert moderator              Nicole : 01 Jun 2010 6:59:01pm I homeschool my children as i believe that a childhood full of freedom, beauty and time to dream, create and just be is what is most likely to allow innovation and emotional health to grow into adults that can create a better future than the one we have now. Bringing amazing people, literature, experience, love to my childrens life is fundamental, after all I have a vested interest in the outcome. I dream that one day schools will look more like libraries where parents, children and teachers can freely find the help and resources and care that they all need to make a true community - responding to everyone's needs - and look less like a jail that locks them in with their same age peers from which they have not so much to learn. My children learn way more from mixed age groups, mentors and others. And they are HAPPY. Reply  Alert moderator   Sophia : 02 Jun 2010 9:41:31pm I also dream about living within a community with shared spaces for dialogue. Garden-libraries that enable people to work together to discuss and develop sustainable projects. Learning spaces that also support children to be involved in community issues (with local and wider implications), where children can learn about anything that fascinates them. Educating my three kids beyond the school walls is a wonderful journey. My 4yo said a couple of weeks ago he doesn't want to go to an institutional school... He is having more fun meeting kids in the home education network and has already completed 'kindy curriculum'.  “If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need.”  Marcus Tullius Cicero (Ancient Roman Lawyer, Writer, Scholar, Orator and Statesman, 106 BC-43 BC)  Reply  Alert moderator        Warren Huck : 01 Jun 2010 6:58:10pm There is a saying in the Homeschool community "get yourself a life and bring your kids along". My experience as a homeschooling parent is that our kids are out in the real world far more often than regular school kids. They are comfortable around adults and other kids of all ages and tend to look out for each other in ways that I dont observe in school educated kids. Also homeschool parents come from a vast range of backgrounds, the two groups that we are members of include, doctors, professors, health workers, teachers and a vast array of others. Reply  Alert moderator   Fiona : 02 Jun 2010 8:04:57pm I totally agree Warren. My thoughts have always been "how can kids learn about the world - they way it works, the social models they can confidently take on and their contribution to it - if they're shut up in schools all day! I agree with other comments that "Home Schooling" is a total misnomer (can we come up with a better way of describing this path?) - learning not being confined to the home and not being based on a "school" model. Trying to recreate the school environment at home would indeed be exhausting but....why would anyone want to that anyway? I believe the "social model" that school is based on ie. try not to be different, listen for the bell, do as you're told, pretend you agree with someone if they'll get off your back for doing so etc, might have been good preparation for the factory floor, but I think we all have higher ambitions than that for our kids in the 21st century...The only place the school model of human interaction is replicated in the Real World, is in the Armed Forces...or in prison. Again...neither are ambitions I have for my kids... Reply  Alert moderator   Nalin : 04 Jun 2010 9:29:31am I totally agree with you about school being an awesome prep for being a good little worker bee, and the system being similar to prison or the army, but people who are operating within the system just can't see this. It seems as though many people see school as an essential part of being a human being, instead of seeing it as a human construct, an institution set up by people. Very few people can step back and see it for what it is. Reply  Alert moderator     analee : 24 Oct 2011 1:46:12am how 'bout "life learning?" instead of homeschooling? I was texting my mum the other day re h/s and said to her that it is "no longer the poor kid that has to be home schooled, rather it's the enriched child that is home schooled - they are the one that has had the door of their class room thrown wide open, and instead of having asphalt at their feet, they have the whole world to play in" ... just one perspective to consider.

It is not that home school is better than state or private school, it is that we do what we think is the best thing for our children at the time. Some kids will do really well either at home or at school, the vast majority do moderately well, and some fail at both. Reply  Alert moderator     Catherine : 01 Jun 2010 6:55:32pm Re: Pat Noller's comments, she seems to understand that homeschoolers are all motivated by Christian faith. This is a false premise. If she is concerned about homeschooled children being brainwashed by faith, where does this leave students of Jewish, Catholic and Islamic schools? I am a Catholic who homeschooled my three children, took them to mosques, temples, etc in order to expose them to the realities of the broader world. They now all identify themselves as atheists, which is proof that they were schooled in an environment that enabled them to develop their own world view. Reply  Alert moderator     Marion : 01 Jun 2010 6:55:09pm Some of the speakers on this program clearly have not met or interracted with home educated children! Perhaps, they should actually meet some before making (ignorant) comment in such a public forum.  Home educated children meet a wide variety of people of all ages, from all walks of life, on a daily basis. They are not locked away from other people, and indoctrinated into cult like families. You will not find a more socially and educationally well balanced child, than a home educated child. Reply  Alert moderator   Judy M : 02 Jun 2010 10:07:16am Our children have only ever been educated at home. Each one is complemented by neighbours, people in shops, restaurants and anywhere because they are polite, helpful and cheerful. Our neighbours tell us that they aren't like "today's school kids" and they don't have "the attitude". They can be called on at any time to help a neighbour and they willingly do so with no expectation of anything in return than a smile and thank you for the job. Our oldest is employed with a gentleman from an ethnic background that we had no previous contact. The man has not been in Australia for very long, is well educated, but his speech is extremely difficult to understand, yet he has a position dealing with customers. Our son has been willing to spend time and effort to ensure the business runs smoothly to help this man and yet the others behave as though they are afraid. Our son has gained immense respect from all and has been told to expect promotion for his work ethic. This has only reinforced to our children that it is a prudent social decision to be homeschooled. Reply  Alert moderator        James : 01 Jun 2010 6:54:32pm Home-Schooling a child with quite severe disability and autism. My 8yo son is 'funcionally non-verbal', but has learned to communicate in other ways (sign language and other non-verbal comm. see 'AAC'). He's been part-time home-schooled for 6 years because he was not learning any significant communication skills or social skills from his special school. He's basically learned all these essential communication and social skills from home!! So the home-schooling has been absolutely essential for his progress, but it has been very hard work, and it's a pity that many people have bias, suspician, and lack of understanding.  I also know other parents who are part-time home-schooling their kids with quite severe autism. These parents are working very hard and making huge sacrifices for their kids to make some progress. I wish there were more people willing to consider it - this might give the special school system some ideas. Reply  Alert moderator     aeon ®: 01 Jun 2010 6:46:17pm Like many things, there is no right nor wrong side to take on this. We home schooled one child of three for a couple of years out of necessity as he was autistic. However it's my view that the social interaction and diversity of experience of a school education is vital to producing well rounded adults even though sometimes kids do fall through the cracks. I also believe that home schooling can both produce excellent students, or insular misinformed citizens, depending on the parents that are actually doing the schooling, and for what reason. Reply  Alert moderator     Amy : 01 Jun 2010 6:38:38pm Loving the show tonight. I'm homeschooling my 7 year old and meet with other home school families on a daily basis. Home school parents have the benefit of organising professionals to run workshops for their children in so many different fields and go on wonderful excursions every week ie galleries, museums,etc. I've been told by my son's teachers ie. dance,gym, drama, choir, taekwondo etc how sociable, friendly, focused and well behaved he his! I love home schooling and couldn't imagine not being a part of the daily excitement of watching him learn so naturally and encouraging him to investigate so many different topics.  Reply  Alert moderator     NSW Parent : 01 Jun 2010 6:35:30pm As a parent of a child with a mild-range intellectual disability, home schooling is definitely an option that needs to be considered. There is a ridiculously small amount of additional funding in the public system for my child. She will thrive with additional support, and reach her maximum potential. But in a typical class of 30 kids, she will become the problem child - her reduced capabilities will manifest as behavioural problems. Reply  Alert moderator     Charlene : 01 Jun 2010 6:34:49pm In regards to specialist education...I think you will find most homeschooling parents provide opportunities for these areas (eg arts, music, drama, sport) according to what their children are interested in (ie lessons from qualified instructors), instead of forcing them to endure all these areas they may not be interested in. On another point, one caller mentioned school being an acceptable way to prepare for the bullying they will encounter in the workplace. How absurd. Homeschooling is about helping your children know who they are, developing their self esteem and self confidence so when faced with bullying they are truely resillient. I would rather not risk my children putting up with bullying on a daily basis. Reply  Alert moderator     Mary : 01 Jun 2010 6:34:25pm We are a homeschooling family with two primary school age boys. Living in a metropolitan area, we have no shortage of opportunities to socialise or follow the children's passions. Within our networks we are exposed to a wealth of information and people with so many different and varied skills. And sometimes we have too many social activities open to us!  Homeschooling is such a wonderful opportunity for us to spend time with our kids and support them in their learning journey. It can be difficult at times to be with them full time without a break but the rewards far outweigh any of the hard times!  I think our children will be at a huge advantage when they are contemplating University and further education. They are self directed learners from a young age and they get to follow their passions from the start. They have more freedom to explore what they want from life and in turn I think they come out of their childhood with a much better knowledge of who they are and what they want.  Great discussion and very happy to hear from Terry Harding!   Reply  Alert moderator     Wendy and Steve Hodgman : 01 Jun 2010 6:34:25pm We have homeschooled 4 children. We are in the "unstructured" end of education and have never followed a curriculum. We are not homeschooling for religious reasons. Our oldest 3 have all chosen to enter school at year 11 in the ACT system. Our oldest achieved a UAI of 99.7. He is currently in the third year of a Phd in Physics at ANU. Our daughter achieved UAI of 96 and is currently working in Canada training horses. Our second son is currently in Year 12 and on track for a ATAR over 90. Out 4th child is at home. These are the academic achievements that people seem to want to validate homeschooling. However we have many other measures that show that our children have thrived with home education. They have all fitted in to whatever the situation - social, work, uni, sport. We get on well with them and they are certainly young citizens to be proud of. Reply  Alert moderator     Louise Young : 01 Jun 2010 6:34:20pm I think there is a lot of fear surrounding homeschooling as many people simply do not know or understand what it LOOKS like.  For most of us it isn't even 'home' schooling taking place - it's at the museum schooling, it's bushwalking for the day schooling, it's at the park with our friends schooling, it's building a new chook house in the backyard schooling... We're certainly not hiding our kids away from society at the kitchen table replicating the classroom environment for 6 hours a day.   Reply  Alert moderator     Simon Deeth : 01 Jun 2010 4:32:31pm In Tasmania Home Education is regulated by the Tasmanian Home Education Advisory Council (THEAC)which was set up by the State Government in 1994. I am chair of this council which consists of 6 members, three of whom are appointed by the minister, and three who are selected from candidates nominated by the home educating community. We oversee the registering and monitoring of home educating families. There are approximately 600 children from just over 300 families registered with us.  We have recently reviewed the reasons why our currently registered families started to home educate. 49% Philosophical, 27% Difficulties/Dissatisfaction with School, 17% Religious and 7% Special Needs. We monitor new families within 3 months of provisional registration and then 12 months later, and established families generally every two years. In Tasmania it is the parent/guardian who is registered, not the child, so we are looking to see that the parent has a program is in place is appropriate to the child. Reply  Alert moderator     Concerned : 01 Jun 2010 12:39:07pm I have some grave concerns about home schooling, based on my observations of home schooling in my extended family. Home schooling numbers are increasing. One of the drivers for this is that Centrelink provides an exemption from the activity test for home schooling parents whose youngest child turns 6. This means that parents can claim a benefit, eg Newstart and not have to look for work or study.  In the case of my extended family, the driver for home schooling is based on religious principles and not wanting their children to be adversely influenced by others. It concerns me that there is no robust outcome data collected on home schooled children. They do not sit for National NAPLAN assessment. Other than self reporting by parents and the very occasional inspection, no one knows if these children finish schooling able to take up further study or enter the workforce and successfully maintain employment.  There will always be bright home schooled children who go on to achieve wonderful things, but we have no way of knowing what happens to all the other home schooled children. As far as the education of children goes, we have one system where the educator must have at least 4 years tertiary study in teaching and learning, where teachers are supervised by senior teachers, where robust outcome data is routinely collected. The education of children is seen as being so important that a great deal of scholarship and effort goes into providing high quality schooling.  Then there is the home schooling system where parents do not need to have any qualifications in teaching, where there is scant oversight of teaching methods or whether children achieve educational goals. No robust outcome data is collected. There is no Statewide home schooling curriculum.  I have qualifications in education, as does another member of my extended family. We are horrified at what we see happening. Reply  Alert moderator   Julie Melano : 01 Jun 2010 2:16:08pm And I am equally horrified by observing the results of our current mainstream education system!! Many of the parents I interact with will tell me how many hours they spend each week helping with homework. Most feel that THEY are the ones educating the child - at home, at the end of a long day, when everyone is tired and frustrated! These parents swear that their children would never have grasped any of the basics if they hadn't actually spent the hours filling in the gaps at home.  To be fair, attempting to educate anyone in a system where one teacher has to cater for 20 to 30 students (and their huge variation in capabilities and interests) is always going to be fraught with problems. There is no question that there is no better way to educate than one-on-one. I too worry about those homeschooling for religious reasons. However, I would guess that the education of these children would still better or equal regular schooling - as individual needs are far easier to cater to in small numbers. Though perhaps not a typical story of homeschooling, I think the following story may help to ease much of the worry about education generally - for parents of both homeschooled AND 'regular schooled' children. ;) http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article6834367.ece   Reply  Alert moderator     Angel : 01 Jun 2010 2:48:28pm Dear Concerned: Change a few nouns and prepositions and your letter may have been written by a home educating family about children going to school. Since your opinion is based on observations of one family I don't think that can be applied to the entire home schooling community... that's just plain unscientific :) I don't believe that financial gains are by any means a driving force behind home schooling. Have you been at home with your children 24/7? My husband jokes that he goes to a very demanding job to get a break. It is by no means the convenient choice.  And as far as I know,(yes, I just looked it up on-line at http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/payments/newstart.htm, so that I could respond to your concern),the only possible exemptions cited are being over 55. The benefit you may be referring to is Assistance for isolated children, generally awarded to families in remote areas or with other isolating factors such as disabilities which can not be addressed at school. In QLD at least, there are no government benefits and no assistance with books etc. Withdrawing your children from school on religious grounds is as good a reason as any? How do you judge what is a good or bad reason? If you are familiar with your own human rights then you may be aware of the human rights of others. There is some outcome based (great American educational fade that) research, but not many governments are going to fund that are they. No-one has anything to gain by funding or facilitating the research. We would welcome research. Research away.  'Other than self reporting by parents and the very occasional inspection, no one knows if these children finish schooling able to take up further study or enter the workforce and successfully maintain employment.' Well, despite reporting by teachers, and the occasional teacher-parent interview, many children leave school unable to take up further study or maintain employment. This we do know for certain. Home Ed children can take the NAPLAN tests with the co-operation of a school. There are a few open-minded principals out there, bucking the pedagogy. And, parents of school going children can choose to abstain. Teacher training is a whole other kettle of fish, and I'm trying to keep this brief-ish! There are many, great teachers who home educate their own children, and many parents who undertake the study of education to reassure themselves that they are not harming their childrens' development. We've listened to teachers moaning about how tough their jobs are because parents are uninvolved. Well, we're getting involved and finding out that we can actually do it ourselves, and that the rewards far outweigh the challenges. Reply  Alert moderator   uknow-who : 01 Jun 2010 6:49:47pm As a homeschooling family we value creativity, critical thinking and the fostering of empathy and compassion for others.  Currently with the outcomes for Indigenous students being so poor ( and behind non Indigenous students) it would seem crazy to put our children into the school system for a long period of time, cross our fingers and hope for the best. Who is wacky??? Our families have done that for a long time and suffered the consequences. Our child meets a larger homeschooling group 2 days a week, other outings, parenting meetups with other children and extended family and friends. We don't homeschool in a cupboard! I have not seen sibling rivalry to be worse amongst homeschoolers then non homeschoolers...and we assocate with a large group of people. I have a BA in Psychology and I can tell you my son is exposed to a great variety of people thanks to homeschooling!  Families can be too close? Please if your going to get an expert get one that has experience in the area she is commenting on. I enjoy taking him to university with me as I'm doing my Masters in Education. We discover and learn together and its FUN! Children have the tools already to learn....curiosity and creativity.

Here is just a smattering of research from across the world: Standord University, USA http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2000/novdec/articles/homeschooling.html University of Durham, Uk http://www.hslda.org/hs/international/UnitedKingdom/200501130.pdf National Home Education Research Institute, USA http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2003/oct/03102903.html The Fraser Institute, Canada http://www.fraserinstitute.org/commerce.web/product_files/Homeschooling2007.pdf There is a research article within Australia, and I believe a more recent one in the works but it is very difficult to come by as it basically reiterates the results of the links posted above. Contrary to what the government has publicly stated, each state does have statistics on the academic outcomes of a cross-section of homeschoolers - the resutls of all homeschoolers NAPLAN tests are kept separate and forwarded to the government departments that administer home education within their states.

Can you please share with us what it is that you believe a child can learn better at school then he/she can learn under the close guidance of his/her parent(s). Can you please also share with us exactly what you have learnt that could make you a better teacher than a child's parent with a massive amount of resources at their fingertips?  Awaiting your reply. Reply  Alert moderator     Marina : 01 Jun 2010 8:48:24pm Just another thought with regard to the lack of 'certified' qualifications of parents to be teachers (with a small "t", in deference to certified Teachers (with a capital "T"), and also in answer to concerns about "scant oversight" and ability to "achieve educational goals", many homeschoolers purchase curriculum resourses designed by educators and even registered schools (albeit those designed for homeschoolers). These resources often have testing components and teacher guides/answer keys, whilst quite a few have the facility for the students' work to be returned to the curriculum designer for marking and assessment, with the provision of detailed assessment feedback and 'reports'. So, the level of learning is assessible and quantifiable. Some homeschoolers even choose to purchase the same texts as are being used in mainstream schools. Reply  Alert moderator     Judy M : 02 Jun 2010 11:23:33am Dear Concerned, If parents are neglecting to feed and shelter their children they probably are not caring about the education of them. However, if they have cared in those obvious ways they are likely to consider the need for education as more than just hiding them in a shoe box until they turn 16 or allowing them to play in the park all day and night.  The Centrelink payments mentioned are for VERY low combined incomes. They would need to be a family in some financial constraint to receive such. I am sure there would to be some proof of student participation. Caring parents will want the best for their own children and will not be trying to line their own pockets with this meagre offering. The abuse of the system is not from the diligent parents and their results will be seen before long. There are numerous ways to homeschool. Our family has used the ACE curriculum which offers a Christian base for the necessary literacy and numeracy skills required for life and further study access. There is much data available on this. Perhaps you could contact Terry Harding for some further information, after all, he is involved in research in this area.  As mentioned, there are many opportunities for home educated children to interact with others in ways that parents deem useful and positive.  Not all homeschooled students are going to earn masters degrees but they are likely to achieve their best with their parental support. The general population doesn't send their children to school to gain a masters degree but they want their children to learn.  The outcomes from homeschooled children has been discussed and recorded and the best way to find out is to be willing to be informed and ask.

What concerns me is what they are actually learning in those four years. I knew a new primary teacher who only discovered teaching phonics (one of the primary foundations for teaching reading) after they had graduated.  Have you ever sat down with your family member to see the work that their children are doing?   Reply  Alert moderator     KC : 03 Aug 2010 8:29:08pm Hi Concerned, I challenge you to show that NAPLAN testing provides 'robust' data. There is much debate around standardised testing, including amongst qualified teachers. In reality, these tests are politically driven and don't tell the good teachers anything they didn't already know.  As an aside, many homeschoolers choose to participate in standardised testing.  I also wanted to respond to your comment about the bright homeschooled children. Likewise, there will always be bright institutionally educated children who go on to achieve wonderful things. But we already know what happens to those who 'slip through the cracks' in institutional education. Illiteracy is highly associated with delinquent behaviour and yet our schools still fail to teach children to read!
