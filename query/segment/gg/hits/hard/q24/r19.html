  Perspective<br>
  Sean Gabb<br>
  University of Buckingham<br>
  Written September 2004</strong></p>

  <p>Home schooling can be loosely defined as any education provided
  otherwise than by formal schooling outside the home. Such education
  may be provided by parents or guardians, or by tutors engaged by
  parents or guardians. So defined, home schooling has a long history
  in England.</p>

  <p><strong>Historical Background</strong></p>

  <p>Most notably, it was the custom of the Kings and Queens to have
  their children educated at home. Indeed, the children of Her present
  Majesty are the first in the Royal Family to have attended any
  school. She was herself educated at home by private tutors. The
  education of Queen Victoria was supervised by Baroness Lehtzen, a
  German governess. That of George III was supervised by the Marquis of
  Bute, who after the King&#39;s accession in 1760, became one of the
  country&#39;s less effective Prime Ministers. Certainly, he was one
  of the less fortunate.</p>

  <p>It was the custom of the wealthier classes to send their sons to
  one of the various public or grammar schools set up since the middle
  ages - the oldest, King&#39;s School in Canterbury, dating back
  apparently to 597. But this was by no means a universal custom.
  Though the education provided was usually excellent, if rather
  narrowly focussed on the classical languages, it was often attended
  by severe disadvantages. Teachers frequently maintained discipline
  with the most savage violence. Take, for example, Nicholas Udall
  (1504-56). An admired scholar and translator and a friend of royalty,
  he was the author of <em>Ralph Roister Doister</em>, the first comic
  play in English and the obvious model for later works by Marlowe and
  Shakespeare. He was also Headmaster of Eton College. In 1541, he was
  dismissed for theft of school property and sexual abuse of the boys.
  His great partiality for flogging was noted, but not held against
  him. Nor was his general behaviour thought that scandalous: in 1555,
  the year before his death,, he was appointed Headmaster of
  Westminister School, and a street near the school is now named after
  him.</p>

  <p>Nearly two centuries later, in 1809, Dr Keate was appointed
  Headmaster of Eton, and remains famous for the violent beatings he
  inflicted on the poet Shelley and on a generation of Victorian
  notables.</p>

  <p>The teachers aside, there were the boys. Collective bullying,
  generally ignored by the teachers, was the norm, and could result in
  serious maiming or even death. The fagging system allowed older boys
  to treat the younger as their personal servants, and was an
  opportunity for gross cruelty. According to one man who had been a
  fag at Eton in 1824,</p>

  <blockquote>
    [t]he practice of fagging had become an organised system of
    brutality, and cruelty. I was frequently kept up until one or two
    o&#39;clock in the morning, waiting on my masters at upper and
    indulging every sort of bullying at their hands. I have been beaten
    on my palms with the back of a brush, or struck on both sides of my
    face because I had not closed the shutter near my master&#39;s bed
    tight enough or because in making his bed I had left the seam of
    the lower sheet uppermost.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Not surprisingly, many parents chose to have their sons educated
  at home, either wholly or partially. John Stuart Mill was educated
  entirely by this father, and the account of that education forms a
  notorious part of his <em>Autobiography</em>. Edward Gibbon and
  Thomas Babbington Macaulay received part of their education at home
  and part at local day schools. Such was the case with many other
  notable figures in English history.</p>

  <p>For girls, formal schooling was at least a rarity before the
  19<sup>th</sup> century. Though there were academies where they could
  study a basic curriculum, there was nothing for girls equivalent to
  the public and grammar schools. The general custom among the
  wealthier classes was to educate girls at home, or to give them to an
  unmarried female relative for teaching, and then perhaps to send them
  in their later teens to a finishing college where they acquired the
  accomplishments suitable to a young lady. Jane Austin, for example,
  had only one year of formal schooling around the age of ten.</p>

  <p>Among the poorer classes, there was, before the beginning of
  compulsory state education a wide range of semi-formal schooling.
  These are described at length in the writings of the educational
  historian E.G. West, who also shows that the absence of state funding
  and compulsion before 1870 did not prevent most people in England
  from learning to read.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>

  <p>With the great improvements in the quality of the independent
  schools and the establishment of compulsory state education for the
  poorer classes, attendance at school had become for all classes and
  both sexes the general custom by the end of the 19<sup>th</sup>
  century. Before then, however, it can be said that formal schooling
  was one educational option among many. Even by the 20<sup>th</sup>
  century, it was by no means universal. Noel Coward, for example, was
  educated almost wholly at home, briefly attending the Chapel Royal
  Choir School.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Agatha Christie had
  no formal schooling before the age of 16.<a href=
  "#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> She later wrote that her mother &quot;the
  best way to bring up girls was to let them run wild as much as
  possible; to give them food, fresh air and not to force their minds
  in any way&quot;.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> C.S. Lewis had
  only two years of formal schooling as a child - part of this at
  Wynyard School in Watford - a place he later called
  &quot;Belsen&quot;.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a></p>

  <p>Basic education organised by the State came later to England later
  than in almost every other civilised country. Legislation to allow
  local authorities to maintain elementary schools was passed only in
  1870. It took a further 30 years of cautious advance to make
  education compulsory and then free in the state schools, and then for
  local authorities to be allowed to set up secondary schools. The
  reasons for this late start and slow advance were an ideological
  dislike of state activity that remained strong among all classes well
  into the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and a bitter dispute between the
  Christian sects and the State over the continuing viability of the
  religious schools in an environment of free state education, and
  between the sects over the nature of religious instruction in the
  state schools.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> While these disputes
  have largely faded into history, their former importance has left
  clear traces in the English law of education.</p>

  <p><strong>The Law on Home Schooling in England</strong></p>

  <p>The law of education in England can be summarised in the statement
  that while there is a legal duty for parents to educate their
  children, there is no duty to send them to school. The British
  Government openly accepts this summary, declaring on one of its web
  sites:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Parents are allowed to educate their children at home instead of
    school if they choose to do so. Under English law, it is education
    that is compulsory, not schooling.<a href=
    "#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is echoed by the current Secretary of State for
  Education:</p>

  <blockquote>
    My department recognises and respects the right to choose to home
    educate.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The relevant legal wording was settled in section 36 of the
  Education Act 1944:</p>

  <blockquote>
    The parent of every child of compulsory school age shall cause him
    to receive efficient full-time education suitable:
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    (a) to his age, ability and aptitude, and
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    (b) to any special education needs he may have, either by regular
    attendance at school <em>or otherwise</em> [emphasis added]
  </blockquote>

  <p>This wording was carried unchanged into section 7 of the Education
  Act 1996.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a></p>

  <p>The legal meaning of the words &quot;suitable education&quot; was
  clarified in the case of <em>Harrison &amp; Harrison v Stevenson</em>
  on an appeal brought in 1981 in the Worcester Crown Court. In this
  case, the Judge defined a &quot;suitable education&quot; as one such
  as</p>

  <blockquote>
    1. To prepare the children in life for modern civilised society,
    and
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    2. To enable them to achieve their full potential.<a href=
    "#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the subsequent judicial review case of <em>R v Secretary of
  State for Education, ex parte Talmud Torah Machzikei Hadass School
  Trust</em> (1985), Mr Justice Woolf held that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Education is &#39;suitable&#39; if it primarily equips a child for
    life within the community of which he is a member, rather than the
    way of life in the wider country as a whole, as long as it does not
    foreclose the child&#39;s options in later years to adopt some
    other form of life if he wishes to do so.<a href=
    "#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As it currently stands - in September 2004 - the law does not
  require parents to register their children with any school; and,
  within the defined meaning of &quot;suitable&quot; they can provide
  their children with whatever education they please. Parents who wish
  to teach their children at home are not legally required:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>to seek permission from the Local Education Authority to
    educate &quot;otherwise&quot;;</li>

    <li>to inform the Local Education Authority that they have children
    of school age;</li>

    <li>to have regular contact with the Local Education
    Authority;</li>

    <li>to have premises equipped to any specified standard;</li>

    <li>to have any teaching or other educational qualifications of
    their own;</li>

    <li>to cover any specific syllabus;</li>

    <li>to have any fixed timetable;</li>

    <li>to prepare lesson plans of any kind;</li>

    <li>to observe normal school hours or terms;</li>

    <li>to give formal lessons;</li>

    <li>to allow their children to mix with others.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Sections 437-443 of the Education Act 1996 oblige Local Education
  Authorities within England and Wales to take action if it appears
  that a child is not receiving a &quot;suitable&quot; education. If it
  established that a child is not receiving a &quot;suitable&quot;
  education, the Local Education Authority may serve a notice on
  parents requiring them to establish that such an education is being
  provided.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> However, in the case of
  <em>R v Gwent County Council ex parte Perry</em> (1985), the courts
  held that the Local Education Authority should give parents &quot;a
  fair and reasonable opportunity to satisfy it that proper education
  is being provided, having first allowed a sufficient time to set in
  motion arrangements for home education&quot;.<a href=
  "#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> But failure eventually to comply with
  this notice may be followed by a school attendance order. This may be
  challenged in the courts, which will dismiss the notice if shown - on
  the balance of probabilities - that the child is indeed receiving an
  education that a reasonable person would consider to be
  &quot;suitable&quot;.</p>

  <p>This legal duty placed on Local Education Authorities applies only
  where children appear not to be receiving a &quot;suitable&quot;
  education. Where no evidence is available that they are not receiving
  such an education, they have no legal right to seek information from
  parents. This is not an absolute bar on making enquiries. In the case
  of <em>Philips v Brown</em> (1980), the courts held that the Local
  Education Authority is entitled to ask parents for information as a
  basis for making the decision as to whether the education they are
  providing is efficient. If the parent fails to provide information,
  it could be concluded that <em>prima facie</em> the parents are in
  breach of their duty.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a></p>

  <p>But the Local Education Authority is not allowed to specify the
  nature and presentation of such information. Nor can they carry into
  their enquiry assumptions and expectations based on their experience
  of formal schooling. On the Parent Centre website, maintained by the
  Department for Education and Skills, the authorities confirm
  that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    LEAs have no automatic right of access to parents&#39; home.
    Parents may wish to offer an alternative way of demonstrating that
    they are providing suitable education, for example through showing
    examples of work and agreeing to a meeting at another
    venue.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Where a child is registered with a school, but the parents wish to
  withdraw him for teaching at home, there is a formal procedure to be
  followed. The Education (Pupil Registration) Regulation 9(c), 1995
  sets out the conditions under which a child may be removed from the
  admission register of a school. His name must be removed if:</p>

  <blockquote>
    he has ceased to attend the school and the proprietor has received
    written notification from the parent that the pupil is receiving
    education otherwise than at school.<a href=
    "#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Again, parents do not need to seek permission from the Local
  Education Authority of their intention to educate a child at home.
  Nor are they obliged to inform the Local Education Authority - though
  the proprietor of the school must report the removal of the child
  within ten school days.</p>

  <p>There is an exception to this rule in the case of children
  registered at a school providing for special needs. Here, consent
  must be obtained from the Local Education Authority before removing a
  child - see the Education (Pupil Registration) Regulation 9(2), 1995.
  The purpose of this exception, though, is simply to ensure that the
  Local Education Authority can maintain continuity in its provision
  for special educational needs. It is not intended to be used to
  prevent education at home.</p>

  <p>The law also provides for those parents who wish to educate their
  children partly at home and partly at school. In such cases, children
  are registered at a school for full time education - and the school
  collects funding from the authorities on that basis - but the child
  is granted leave of absence from the school. The law insists that
  children of school age who are registered at a school must attend
  regularly. However, such leave of absence does not constitute
  irregular attendance. During such absences, the child is officially
  present, though is in fact being educated elsewhere. It seems
  reasonable that, in such cases, the consent of the school at which
  the child is registered must first be obtained. Again, it is not a
  matter in which the Local Education Authority has any right to
  intervene.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a></p>

  <p><strong>The Law on Home Schooling in Scotland</strong></p>

  <p>England and Scotland have been united under a single Crown since
  1603, and under a common central government since 1707 - though this
  latter fact is somewhat altered by the recent establishment of a
  Scottish Assembly with limited powers. The Union of 1707 provided for
  a single country, but with two systems of law and administration.
  This continues to be the case with education. The law on home
  schooling in Scotland is broadly similar to that in England, so far
  as parents are not required to register their children at any school,
  and can educate them at home without supervision.<a href=
  "#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a></p>

  <p>This being said, there are significant differences with regard to
  withdrawing children from school. According to section 35(1) of the
  Education (Scotland) Act 1980:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Where a child of school age who has attended a public school on one
    or more occasions fails without reasonable excuse to attend
    regularly at the said school, then, unless the education authority
    have consented to the withdrawal of the child from the school
    (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), his parent
    shall be guilty of an offence against this section.
  </blockquote>

  <p>The meaning of this is that parents who wish to withdraw their
  children from school must obtain the consent of the local Director of
  Education. The authorities will then investigate to see whether the
  proposed course of study is &quot;suitable&quot;, and may give or
  withhold consent for the withdrawal.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has refused to give any detailed guidance
  on how the right to withdrawal is to be exercised, and there is a
  shortage of Scottish case law on the matter. However, it is generally
  assumed that the English case law generally applies; and this would
  be taken into account by the Scottish courts in the event of any
  legal proceedings.</p>

  <p><strong>The Law on Home Schooling in Northern Ireland</strong></p>

  <p>The northern six counties of Ireland are part of the United
  Kingdom, and are governed - depending on political circumstances -
  either directly from London or by a local executive body. As with
  Scotland, Northern Ireland has its own legal and administrative
  system.</p>

  <p>The wording of the relevant legislation is copied directly from
  the English Act. Section 45(1) of the Education and Libraries
  Northern Ireland Order 1986 states that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    The parent of every child of compulsory school age shall cause him
    to receive efficient full-time education suitable to his age,
    ability and aptitude and to any special educational needs he may
    have, either by regular attendance at school or otherwise.<a href=
    "#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Parents have an unquestioned legal right to educate their children
  at home, and may withdraw their children if already registered at a
  school in the same way as in England. As with Scotland, there is a
  shortage of local case law on the interpretation of the legislation.
  Again, though, it is assumed that the English case law would be taken
  into account in any legal proceedings.</p>

  <p><strong>The Numbers of Children in Home Schooling</strong></p>

  <p>Because parents are not required by law to inform anyone of their
  decision, there is no reliable way of knowing how many children in
  the United Kingdom are educated at home. All numbers given in the
  literature are estimates based on extrapolations, and there is much
  dispute about the reliability of the underlying methodologies.
  According to Roland Meighan, now retired but formerly the special
  professor of education at Nottingham University, there could be as
  many as 84,000 children in England educated at home. That is about
  one per cent of the English school population.<a href=
  "#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a> However, Brenda Holloway, a trustee of
  the Home Education Advisory Service,<a href=
  "#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a> his methodology is flawed. He takes the
  7,000 families registered with the various home education
  organisations, multiples this by three on the assumption that there
  are three children per family, and then further multiplies by four on
  the assumption that only one in four families bothers to
  register.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a> These multipliers are
  no more than guesses, and so the figure of 84,000 cannot be accepted
  as an accurate measurement of the numbers.</p>

  <p>With this in mind, it is worth noting other alleged numbers,
  without necessarily accepting their reliability. According to Eileen
  Wilson, &quot;informal spokesperson&#39; for Education
  Otherwise&quot; there were, as of May 2000, 25,000 British families
  educating their own children.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>
  According to Leslie Safran, founder of The Otherwise Club, there
  were, as of May 2004, as many as 150,000 children being educated at
  home in the United Kingdom.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>
  According to Alison Preuss, of the Schoolhouse Home Education
  Association, there were, as of August 2004, 6,000 children being
  educated at home in Scotland.<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>
  According to the journalist Morag Lindsay, there were, as of February
  2002, 50,000 children being educated at home in Scotland.<a href=
  "#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> Radically different figures are thrown
  around in reporting and in debates. They are copied from statement to
  statement and often garbled in the process. Most of the time, their
  provenance is unknown, and their underlying methodology cannot even
  be guessed. No one knows what the numbers are. No one can know unless
  the British Government will include some relevant questions in the
  2011 census. Even then, no one will probably know the truth, as there
  is good reason the believe that many people involved in home
  schooling are too suspicious of the authorities to risk revealing
  themselves.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a></p>

  <p>A further difficulty in measuring or even estimating the number of
  children educated at home is the loose definition of home schooling.
  It can cover those children who never go to school, those who attend
  but with leave of absence, and those who go to school for several
  years of their education, but only before or after being taught at
  home. Doubtless, other sub-categories can be imagined. We do not know
  the overall numbers. We do not know the numbers in any of these
  sub-categories. We therefore cannot know what proportion each
  sub-category is to the whole.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, there are two facts about the numbers of which we
  can be reasonably sure. First, we know that home schooling is not
  confined to any one social or religious group. It is not the case
  that all - or perhaps even the majority - of parents who choose to
  educate their children at home are religious fundamentalists or
  well-educated middle class dissenters from the mainstream. In 2002,
  Paula Rothermel of the University of Durham published her research
  <em>Home-Education: Rationales, Practices and Outcomes</em>. In this,
  she explored the aims and practices of families involved in home
  schooling. Her methodology involved a questionnaire survey completed
  by 419 families and 196 assessments evaluating the psychosocial and
  academic development of home-educated children aged eleven years and
  under. She found that at least 14 per cent of the parents in the
  sample were employed in manual and unskilled occupations; and that at
  least 38 per cent of parents in the study had been educated at
  comprehensive schools and at least 21 per cent had no post-school
  qualifications. Whilst 47.5 per cent of parents had attended
  university, at least 27.7 per cent of parents in the study had not.
  The families studied included travellers, those on low incomes, those
  whose children had been in care, religious believers, ethnic
  minorities, single parents, and gay couples. In short, the study
  showed that parents from just about every group in society choose to
  educate their children at home.<a href=
  "#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a></p>

  <p>Second, it is uncontested that the numbers of children being
  educated at home has risen considerably during the past generation.
  We do not need to accept the claim by Professor Meighan that the
  number of families involved rose from ten in 1977 to 10,000 in
  1997.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a> But the weight of anecdotal
  evidence, and the fact that home schooling is increasingly discussed
  in the media, and the increasing perception of - and perhaps just the
  increase in - the reasons why parents choose to educate their
  children at home, indicates a substantial rise in numbers.</p>

  <p><strong>The Reasons for Home Schooling</strong></p>

  <p>The reasons why parents choose to educate their children at home
  or all or part of the time are perhaps as many as the parents
  involved. This being so, we can divide the reasons under several
  broad headings. There is dissatisfaction with discipline or safety at
  school. There is dissatisfaction with the quality of the curriculum
  offered by the schools. There are religious or ideological objections
  to the whole experience of education as provided by the state sector.
  It is not possible to know which of these is the main reason. In many
  cases, it is a combination of many reasons that has led to the
  decision to educate at home. But the reasons are worth separating so
  far as possible, and discussing in the order given.</p>

  <p><em>Discipline and Safety</em></p>

  <p>In its anti-bullying pack, <em>Bullying: Don&#39;t Suffer in
  Silence</em>, the Department for Education and Skills adopts a wide
  definition of the word. Bullying is defined as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <blockquote>
        physical - hitting, kicking, taking belongings
      </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>
      <blockquote>
        verbal - name calling, insulting, making offensive remarks
      </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>
      <blockquote>
        indirect - spreading nasty stories about someone, exclusion
        from social groups, being made the subject of malicious
        rumours<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The information pack uses information gathered from a survey of
  five primary schools and 14 secondary schools across England in 1997,
  taking evidence from 2,308 pupils aged ten to 14 years. It showed
  that bullying then, as defined, was widespread. 32.3 per cent of
  children reported that they had been bullied once or twice, and 4.1
  per cent that they were bullied several times a week.<a href=
  "#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a> The risks of bullying were stated to
  be:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Victims may be reluctant to attend school and are often absent.
    They may be more anxious and insecure than others, having fewer
    friends and often feeling unhappy and lonely. Victims can suffer
    from low self-esteem and negative self-image, looking upon
    themselves as failures - feeling stupid, ashamed and unattractive.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    Victims may present a variety of symptoms to health professionals,
    including fits, faints, vomiting, limb pains, paralysis,
    hyperventilation, visual symptoms, headaches, stomach aches, bed
    wetting, sleeping difficulties and sadness. Being bullied may lead
    to depression or, in the most serious cases, attempted suicide. It
    may lead to anxiety, depression, loneliness and lack of trust in
    adult life.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In 2002, it was reported that more than 20 children every year in
  Britain were committing suicide because bullying and other pressures
  at school.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a> In the summer term of
  2003, 12,800 children in England were suspended from school for
  attacking other pupils and a further 336 were expelled, presumably
  for more vicious attacks; 4,000 others were suspended and 280
  excluded permanently for assaulting adults.<a href=
  "#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a></p>

  <p>Though schools are required to take the matter seriously, it is in
  practice very hard to police bullying. Teachers cannot be present at
  all times in the class and playground - and certainly cannot control
  what happens on the way to and from school. And even reporting a
  bully can make things worse for a child.</p>

  <p>Not surprisingly, experience or just fear of bullying has prompted
  many parents to educate their children at home. According to Belinda
  Harris Reed of Education Otherwise:</p>

  <blockquote>
    We are getting 100 new families a month. I don&#39;t think that
    people take on home educating lightly. Now most people take their
    children out of school because of bullying, not like me for a

  </blockquote>

  <p>Take the case of Edward Lupton. In 1993, when he was 13, he
  decided to leave school because of persistent bullying. He
  explains:</p>

  <blockquote>
    I was picked on at school, and by one boy in particular. Whenever I
    walked past he&#39;d say &quot;Jelly belly&#39; or &#39;You&#39;re
    so fat&quot;.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The bully made his life miserable. He had lost his father in a car
  crash at the age of three. He was bullied about not having a father
  as well as about being overweight. Eventually, he took himself out of
  school and studied at home with his mother.</p>

  <p>Take the case of Christianna, who:</p>

  <blockquote>
    was twelve when her parents reluctantly withdrew her from school in
    March 1996. Christianna is a very bright girl and her parents had
    been pleased initially when their daughter gained a place at a
    prestigious girl&#39;s grammar school.<br>
    <br>
    Christianna&#39;s father was a further education lecturer and her
    mother a primary teacher, Christianna has a brother a few years
    younger. Family circumstances were not easy. Mr. K was suffering
    from cancer and had been unable to work full-time for several
    years. Mrs. K also worked as a supply teacher as the burden of
    caring for two children and a sick husband had made full-time work
    impossible. The family had very little money and lived in a
    somewhat derelict house situated in the middle of woods close to an
    otherwise densely populated urban centre.<br>
    <br>
    Christianna was badly bullied at school; she did not fit in.
    Although the school was selective Christianna was called a
    &#39;Boff&#39;, as she was keen to learn and possibly envied for
    her exceptional ability and the ease with which she learned. The
    other girls all seemed to have plenty of money for fashionable
    clothes and were more interested in pop music and boys than their
    studies. This at least was Christianna&#39;s perception.<a href=

  </blockquote>

  <p>It is unlikely that the problem of bullying has diminished in
  recent years. It has now been joined by ethnic gang fights in areas
  of high immigration, extortion rackets, drug abuse, sexual predation,
  and a general mirroring within school of the social problems that now
  take up so much of the political debate in Britain.</p>

  <p><em>Curriculum and Quality of Instruction</em></p>

  <p>Though the claim is hotly denied by the Government and other
  interested bodies, it is widely believed that standards of education
  have been steadily falling in the state sector. Every year, the
  examination results suggest steady improvement, with more passes than
  ever before and higher grades. This is increasingly dismissed as a
  statistical illusion brought about by making the papers easier and by
  lowering the marking standards. According to Peter Oborne, writing in
  <em>The Spectator</em>,</p>

  <blockquote>
    An important series of articles in the <em>Economist</em> has shown
    how a growing number of universities now regard A-levels as such a
    worthless measure of achievement that they are searching for other
    methods of assessing potential students. In medical and veterinary
    science, six of the top faculties in Britain now select through a
    special biomedical admissions test. Eight law schools are now
    following suit, with a legal aptitude test. Other universities have
    simply given up on A-levels as a method of sorting out bright
    students. Leeds Metropolitan and Huddersfield universities, which
    have 20 applicants for each physiotherapy place, just choose
    successful applicants randomly from those with the right
    grades.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In 2003, Channel Four screened a series called <em>That&#39;ll
  Teach &#39;Em</em>. In this, a class was assembled of 16 year old
  students who had achieved high grades in the General Certificate of
  Secondary Education examinations. These were given four weeks of the
  sort of education a grammar school had provided in the 1950s and then
  set examinations based on the old O Level papers. Most did badly in
  English Language and English Literature. Most failed Mathematics and
  about half History. &quot;Most people failed maths&quot; said Thomas
  Jewell, normally a pupil at Churchill community school in north
  Somerset. &quot;It was quite hard. We weren&#39;t able to use a
  calculator and we had a lot of arithmetic to do.&quot;<a href=
  "#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a></p>

  <p>Commenting on the series, Chris Woodhead, the former Chief
  Inspector of Schools, said comparing GSCEs and O Levels was a valid
  exercise. &quot;The fact is today&#39;s students do not have the
  ability to write an essay&quot; he said &quot;and they do not have
  the body of knowledge that was needed to do well in a O-level. GCSEs
  have been dumbed down.&quot;<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a></p>

  <p>Added to declining education standards is the growth of
  bureaucratic control over the whole system. The National Curriculum
  was introduced in 1988 as a means of raising standards across
  England. It has become an inflexible burden on schools, effectively
  centralising control over education. It determines the content of
  what will be taught, and sets attainment targets for learning. It
  also determines how performance will be assessed and reported.
  Naturally, it constrains all effort at innovation, and prevents the
  tailoring of curriculum to the actual or perceived needs of
  children.</p>

  <p>Mary Rose is a former school teacher living in Gloucestershire.
  She started educating her five children at home after the
  introduction of the national Curriculum in 1988. She voices the
  growing belief that the state sector is now so rigid that it cannot
  accommodate the needs of individual children:</p>

  <blockquote>
    In the old days teachers had time to build up a rapport with
    children.... But now, immediately after the register it&#39;s on
    with the numeracy and literacy hour and everything is scripted.
    There&#39;s been a sea change in the approach to education.<a href=
    "#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Radical disenchantment with the state education system, and with
  those parts of the independent sector that follow the National
  Curriculum, has determined many parents to educate their children at
  home. Some parents choose home schooling as a first alternative.
  Others choose it only because they cannot afford the preferred
  alternative of a special school in the independent sector.</p>

  <p>Take the case of Molly, aged nine, reported by Mike Alpress and
  Eileen Turnbull:</p>

  <blockquote>
    She lives on a run down council estate, close to drug dealers and
    addicts, on the outskirts of a large Essex Town. Neither of her
    parents work, her Father has been unemployed for many years. Her
    older siblings, both articulate and intelligent, were home educated
    for some years but now attend school.<br>
    <br>
    Molly is a gifted child, with a flare for mathematics in
    particular. She is currently studying for G.C.S.E. Maths with a
    view to taking the exam next Summer. It has come to the stage that
    she is now better than her parents at maths and they are at a loss
    as to how to meet her needs. Contact has been made with the
    National Association for Gifted Children, and Molly&#39;s Father
    has tried to &#39;tap-in&#39; to some of the current government
    innovations for clever children, but has, thus far, been frustrated
    due to many of them only taking place in the larger cities. The
    family do not own a car and the cost and paucity of public
    transport makes it difficult for them to travel outside the
    immediate locality.<br>
    <br>
    Molly&#39;s parents are reluctant to send her to a local school as
    they feel she will be &#39;different&#39; and not get the teaching
    she requires. To send her to a &#39;good&#39; state school outside
    the local area would mean having to pay fares, which they cannot
    afford. They obviously are not in a position to pay for a place at
    an independent school for Molly, and do not have any guarantees
    that she would get the teaching she needs even if they were to
    afford it.<br>
    <br>
    Molly studies all areas of the curriculum. Her work rate is
    colossal with reams of recorded work. Comparatively little
    practical work is done, probably because of the cost of materials.
    She does have books, but the vast majority of them are &#39;hand-me
    downs&#39; from when her elder siblings were educated at home.
    Expensive visits out are few and far between. However, Molly is a
    talented all rounder. She plays several musical instruments,
    including piano (for which she has lessons) and guitar. She swims
    for the local Swimming club, plays hockey and is a member of the
    local St John&#39;s Ambulance Brigade.<a href=
    "#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>Religious and Ideological Dissent</em></p>

  <p>The curriculum provided within the great majority of British
  schools is secular in tone. It is also neutral or even liberal on
  matters of sexual conduct. This is so in the state sector, and also
  in much of the independent sector - not excepting even the religious
  schools. There are deeply religious families who find this
  unacceptable, who cannot afford or otherwise gain access to
  alternative schooling, and who therefore choose home schooling. They
  choose this for the negative reason, just stated, that the schools
  available are said to be agents of secular humanist indoctrination,
  and for the positive reason that their faith requires learning to be
  integrated into home life.</p>

  <p>Take the example of Stuart McKay, a Pentecostalist preacher, and
  his wife Diane, the manager of a charity shop. Interviewed in 2002,
  they said they were motivated by their strong Christian faith to
  educate their six older children at home, and that they would educate
  their youngest child at home as soon as she was able to understand
  the instruction. Mrs McKay adds:</p>

  <blockquote>
    We do it partly because the Bible says it is the parents&#39; duty
    to teach their children. But also when Reuben [their eldest child]
    was about to start school 10 years ago, there was a big thing about
    bullying.... We wanted to teach him ourselves. It worked so well,
    we carried on with the rest of our children.<a href=
    "#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Take Jane Villalobos, a Roman Catholic mother of four from
  Birmingham. She was concerned that her children would lose their
  faith if they attended school. She says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    I looked at Catholic schools and felt that the chances of my
    children still practising their faith at the age of 18 would be
    very slim.... I felt that the most important thing for all of them
    was to keep their faith.
  </blockquote>

  <p>She decided to educate her children at home, wondering</p>

  <blockquote>
    if I would be undermining the system by taking them out.... But
    ultimately, as a parent your responsibility is for your own
    children.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is not only Christians who educate their children at home.
  Rubana Akhgar is a Moslem living in Ilford. She belongs to a radical
  group that believes in turning Britain into an Islamic state. She
  does not trust the education that her children would receive in even
  the most firmly Islamic independent school. So she educates them at
  home. She says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    I want to protect my children from this society and bring them up
    in a strict Islamic environment so that it becomes a complete way
    of life for them. I don&#39;t think they will reject it but if they
    did I would be devastated because they would end up in hellfire for
    the hereafter.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Nor is it only the strongly religious who have a principled
  objection to school. Take Roland Meighan, the retired academic
  already mentioned. He is a radical liberal in his politics. He quotes
  Bertrand Russell in nearly all his writings. He is an advocate of the
  look-say method of learning to read, and despises the phonic system
  so loved by educational conservatives. For him, the great benefit of
  home schooling is not that it serves to bring a child up within a
  minority tradition, but that it liberates the mind and creates true
  individuality. Children do not need to be sent to school to learn, he
  says. Instead;</p>

  <blockquote>
    Parents soon find out that young children are natural learners.
    They are like explorers or research scientists busily gathering
    information and making meaning out of the world. Most of this
    learning is not the result of teaching, but rather a constant and
    universal learning activity as natural as breathing. Our brains are
    programmed to learn unless discouraged. A healthy brain stimulates
    itself by interacting with what it finds interesting or challenging
    in the world around it. It learns from any mistakes and operates a
    self-correcting process.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Intellectually, he is an heir of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who, in
  his <em>Emile, ou l&#39;&#233;ducation</em>, argued for a form of
  private education that preserved the inherent goodness of an alleged
  natural state while also providing the instruction needed to become a
  successful, and therefore a moral, person.<a href=
  "#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a> It is the duty of parents to support
  this natural process - encouraging, supporting, tolerating, above all
  understanding that it is through their own efforts that children
  learn to make sense of their world, and also &quot;acquire the
  attitudes and skills necessary for successful learning throughout
  their lives&quot;. The process can be slowed and even wholly
  prevented by &quot;insensitive adult interference&quot;.</p>

  <blockquote>
    Sadly, the schools available to us, whether state or private, are
    often based on an impositional model which, sooner or later, causes
    children to lose confidence in their natural learning and its
    self-correcting features, and instead, learn to be dependent on
    others to &#39;school&#39; their minds.<a href=
    "#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He says elsewhere:</p>

  <blockquote>
    It&#39;s a fascist doctrine which says you&#39;ve got to force
    people to learn, that they won&#39;t do it without
    compulsion.<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>For Professor Meighan and those who agree with him, home schooling
  is the ultimate in progressive education. Indeed, many such people
  dislike the term home schooling. They are happier with unschooling.
  Their objection to school is not necessarily the content of
  education, but the process of its delivery. Like Professor Meighan,
  they believe that there should be no artificial boundaries between
  playing and learning and working or between ages. For them, education
  is a process that begins at birth, and is best achieved by
  encouraging each individual to learn by himself.<a href=
  "#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a></p>

  <p>There are many other reasons for home schooling. One of the
  strangest is the lack of provision by local authorities. In 2002,
  Anthony Dixon was among 80 other children in the London Borough of
  Hackney who, because of a failure of planning by the Local Education
  Authority, were left without any school at all and had to be taught
  at home.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a> This kind of home
  schooling by default comes into a separate category. However, what
  mostly connects parents who choose to educate their children at home
  is a dislike of the formal school curriculum and its delivery as
  these have emerged in recent years.</p>

  <p><strong>Methods of Home Schooling</strong></p>

  <p>For obvious reasons, it is not possible to describe - except at
  immense length - the methods that parents use for teaching their
  children at home. Some parents follow the National Curriculum at
  home, believing that they can do better than the state schools. So
  far as possible, they duplicate schools at home, complete with fixed
  hours, textbooks, report cards, and field trips. Others reject the
  National Curriculum, preferring to concentrate on Music or Latin, or
  whatever they themselves think a &quot;suitable&quot; education for
  their children. This may involve some duplication of school. It may
  also involve a much less conventional style of education. As said,
  the devoutly religious prefer to integrate instruction into normal
  family life. Those who share the views of Professor Meighan will use
  methods many regard as at least eccentric.<a href=
  "#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a></p>

  <p>Take the case of Mika and Naomi van Hees:</p>

  <blockquote>
    It&#39;s nearly noon on a damp Thursday in term time, and two
    seven-year-old sisters are bouncing and laughing on a big
    trampoline behind their house in deepest Wales. Their mother is
    looking on with a fond smile, their father watches as he walks past
    with a bucket to feed the ducks. Why aren&#39;t they at school?<br>
    <br>
    They are, in a sense. Mika and Naomi are home-educated, and, except
    for some formal lessons with their father on Mondays and outside
    lessons in gymnastics and piano, they do pretty much what they
    want. That might be using the computer, playing chess and
    backgammon or helping to bake bread for the 15 members of this
    160-acre &#39;eco-community&#39; a few miles from the wild
    Pembrokeshire coast.<br>
    <br>
    &#39;We give them the space not to do something until they&#39;re
    ready for it,&#39; says their mother, Anja van Hees. &#39;They have
    such perseverance when they&#39;re interested, like when they
    helped to cut down an ash tree. Sometimes they might draw all day
    long, or they might do nothing and just go to bed - they&#39;re
    very in tune with their physical needs.&#39;<br>
    <br>
    The girls are identical twins, but with different interests: Naomi
    loves horses and has learnt to read - her favourite book is Hansel
    and Gretel. Mika doesn&#39;t read yet and prefers numbers and
    learning tables. &#39;I&#39;ve been building Lego and doing jigsaws
    this morning,&#39; she says.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    But they share a wary attitude towards formal schooling, even
    though they have friends at the local primary in Newport.
    &#39;School&#39;s not very nice because you have to stay inside all
    the time,&#39; says Naomi. &#39;But I might go to college when
    I&#39;m more grown up.&#39; Mika adds: &#39;You&#39;re locked
    inside a building and you have to do what they say. The only time
    you can go out is at playtime. Here we can go out and see the
    animals when we want.&#39;<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>What cannot be doubted is the wealth of resources available to
  parents who choose to educate their children at home. Until the
  1980s, the main resource other than the knowledge of parents
  themselves was books bought or borrowed form libraries. This was then
  supplemented by videos and floppy disks of material, mostly acquired
  form the United States. Nowadays, a Google search using the terms
  &quot;home schooling&quot; or &quot;homeschooling&quot; and
  &quot;resources&quot; will turn up tens of thousands of pages
  catering to every possible religious and philosophical and other
  point of view. There are lesson plans, and software packages, and
  advice to parents on teaching methods and dealing with special needs,
  and whole scanned texts. Much of this, inevitably, is American. But
  this is no problem for British home schoolers. Given the ubiquity of
  Internet access - either in the home or in public libraries - no one
  can claim that children educated at home are necessarily deprived of
  suitable learning materials.</p>

  <p>In his specific praise of home schooling, Professor Meighan speaks
  for himself and for only a section of the whole movement. But in his
  claims about its modern feasibility, he speaks for all:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Schools were established in an information-poor society, but
    we&#39;re in an information-rich society now: there&#39;s radio,
    TV, video, the internet, books and specialist magazines. Of course
    people can do it at home.<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>The Effects of Home Schooling</strong></p>

  <p>The effects, however defined and measured, of educating children
  at home are generally claimed to be at least satisfactory. This may
  be because they are. But, as repeatedly said, we do not know how many
  children are being educated at home. The large home schooling
  movement in Britain, and the much larger movement in the United
  States both lay stress on the benefits of educating children at home.
  So do most academic researchers. But home schooling is only likely to
  be reported when it is successful. There may be many - even many more
  - failures which are not reported. In estimating the effects of home
  schooling, we may be in the position of a man who studies gambling by
  only looking at those come forward and talk about their winnings.</p>

  <p>This sceptical point being made - and it must be kept in mind - it
  is worth looking at the conclusions reached by Dr Rothermel, which
  are the largest and most rigorous available for the United Kingdom.
  She reports that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    The results show that 64% of the home-educated Reception aged
    children scored over 75% on their PIPS Baseline Assessments as
    opposed to 5.1% of children nationally. The National Literacy
    Project (Years 1,3,5) assessment results reveal that 80.4% of the
    home-educated children scored within the top 16% band (of a normal
    distribution bell curve), whilst 77.4% of the PIPS Year 2
    home-educated cohort scored similarly. Results from the
    psychosocial instruments confirm the home-educated children were
    socially adept and without behavioural problems. Overall, the
    home-educated children demonstrated high levels of attainment and
    good social skills<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>She also notes that the children of working class, poorly-educated
  parents were doing significantly better than middle class children.
  While five and six year old children from middle class backgrounds
  scored only 55.2 per cent in the test, they scored 71 per cent. Dr
  Rothermel suspects the cause of this is that working class parents
  are much harder at pushing their children, even they are less
  obviously qualified to teach them at home.<a href=
  "#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a></p>

  <p>What anecdotal evidence can be acquired is also broadly positive.
  Take, for example, the case of Farooq and Halimahton Yusof, who live
  in England. They taught all five of their children at home. Al five
  excelled in mathematics, and entered university several years before
  is normally the case.<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a> Or take the
  case of Anthony Dixon, already mentioned. Though he was taught at
  home not because his parents positively chose home schooling, his
  progress at home was reported to be excellent.<a href=
  "#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a></p>

  <p>Against this, take a case just reported to the author of this
  paper by a friend in conversation. His sister, who like him, was
  educated at a technical school in Kent during the 1970s - technical
  schools were set up after 1944 to prepare children for careers in
  engineering and the other technical sectors - decided to educate her
  three children at home. She had no educational qualifications and no
  particular skills as a teacher. She did not really teach her
  children. Instead, &quot;they were left to drag themselves up&quot;.
  The results were not impressive. They were perhaps no obvious
  advertisement for home schooling. But they were not that badly
  either.</p>

  <p>The children are now in their early 20s. The eldest runs his own
  business, and is literate and numerate enough to handle all the
  administration of the business. The middle child is presently
  training as a physical education instructor. The youngest - her only
  daughter - is pregnant and considering marriage to the father. All
  three children are said to be remarkably self-confident in their
  dealings with the world. While they had, during their education at
  home, little contact with children of their own age, they did mix
  with a wide circle of people from other age groups. The author&#39;s
  friend has sent his own children to the local school. He is not
  unhappy with the quality of education, but he worries about the
  &quot;negative attitudes&quot; of the children with whom they mix. He
  complains about their &quot;poor sense of values and aspirations,
  especially in the educational field&quot;.</p>

  <p>This is the least favourable anecdotal evidence the author can
  find of the effects of being educated at home. To repeat, it is not
  that bad. Doubtless, there are terrible cases known to various social
  workers - cases, for example, where children are taken out of school
  or never sent there in the first place, and who run wild. This,
  however, brings us to the unmapped frontier that divides some kind of
  &quot;suitable&quot; education from outright truancy.</p>

  <p>It seems that the main disadvantage of educating children at home
  is the often very high opportunity cost. Usually, one of the parents
  must stay at home part of the time to supervise the education. Often,
  one parent must stay at home all the time. This means the loss of
  part or all of one salary - a considerable sacrifice in a country
  like Britain which, though very rich overall, has a high cost of
  living and relatively high taxes. There are the costs of seeking the
  necessary materials. There are the costs of sending children for
  examination at special centres - costs which, assuming nine GCSEs and
  four of the new modular A Levels, may run to around &#163;1,000 per
  child.</p>

  <p>See Mrs E.J. Keele, writing to a national newspaper in January
  2004:</p>

  <blockquote>
    I&#39;M A &#39;stay-at-home mum&#39; who is in the happy position
    of being able to afford not to work. But that freedom does come at
    a price.<br>
    <br>
    My family doesn&#39;t have lavish holidays, and my husband and I
    are often forced to go without for the sake of our children.<br>
    <br>
    My husband&#39;s salary keeps a roof over our heads, food in our
    mouths and pays the bills, and the family allowance of &#163;150 a
    month keeps our three children clothed and in shoes.<a href=
    "#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Unless one of the parents is in an occupation that pays an income
  well above the national average, the decision to educate children at
  home involves considerable sacrifice for the whole family.</p>

  <p><strong>Calls for the Regulation of Home Schooling</strong></p>

  <p>While the law, in England at least, has never placed any barriers
  to the right of parents to educate their children at home, and while
  there is no significant evidence to suggest that children are
  suffering by not going to school, there are the beginnings in Britain
  of organised opposition to home schooling.</p>

  <p>In June 2004, Kim Tomsett spoke at the conference in Bournemouth
  of the Professional Association of Teachers, which is one of the main
  teaching trade unions. She called for home schooling to be regulated.
  In particular, she called or a change in the law to make it
  compulsory for parents to submit to external monitoring. She
  explained:</p>

  <blockquote>
    These are the only group of children who have no consistent level
    of monitoring or inspection yet are the only group taught in the
    main by those with no qualifications.<a href=
    "#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Ms Tomsett appears to be a lone voice in England. There are ugly
  stories to be found in the newspapers. It seems that some authorities
  are trying to conflate home schooling with truancy. Individual
  officials have been accused of threatening parents known to be
  educating their children at home - saying that their children would
  be put on the &quot;at-risk&quot; register. There is one story of a
  school that informed a mother that it was illegal for her to take one
  child out of school following the suicide of another who had been
  bullied there.<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a> But none of this
  yet reflects official policy. The official policy remains the
  statement, already given, of the relevant minister:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Parents are allowed to educate their children at home instead of
    school if they choose to do so. Under English law, it is education
    that is compulsory, not schooling.
  </blockquote>

  <p>In Scotland, though, there is far more opposition to home
  schooling, and this is becoming official policy there. Writing about
  the case of the McKay family, given above, Mark Brown objects very
  strongly - if with a poor grasp of the rules of argumentation - to
  the notion of keeping children out of formal schooling:</p>

  <blockquote>
    I, for one, deplore their decision. And I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not
    alone....<br>
    <br>
    Unless we want to live in a society with a strictly imposed state
    religion, we should uphold the idea of a complete separation of
    church and state.<br>
    <br>
    That means, where education is concerned, there should be no
    religious instruction in schools....<br>
    <br>
    With no experience of school, the McKays&#39; kids will hear very
    few views other than those of their parents. As devout Christians,
    can the couple really be trusted to give a balanced picture where
    questions such as evolution or sex education are concerned?<br>
    <br>
    As for bullying, of course, violence and intimidation take place in
    our playgrounds, and it is a problem which needs to be much more
    openly and thoroughly addressed.<br>
    <br>
    That said, removing our kids from the classroom is not the answer.
    We can&#39;t wrap our children in cotton wool and try to keep them
    away from the difficulties of life.<br>
    <br>
    In fact, the social skills kids learn at school are immensely
    important in preparing them for later life.<br>
    <br>
    There is much more at stake in the case of the McKay family than
    the future of their own children, however.<br>
    <br>
    Opting children out of the education system implies that state
    schools are unfit to teach our young people.<br>
    <br>
    That is an absolute insult to Scotland&#39;s teachers. Despite the
    disgraceful suggestions of some politicians and newspaper editors,
    teachers are not responsible for the problems which exist within
    Scottish education.<br>
    <br>
    A Labour government should be taxing the wealthy to pay for a state
    education system we can all be proud of, not pandering to people
    like the McKays who think our teachers are unfit to educate their
    children.<a href="#N_63_"><sup>(63)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Judith Gillespie, development manager of the Scottish Parent
  Teacher Council, agrees:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Part of the point of school is that children learn to cope with
    what the world will throw at them in a comparatively safe
    environment.... They need to learn to deal with the awkward squad,
    because, at some time in their lives, they are bound to meet people
    like that.
  </blockquote>

  <p>She feels there is a danger that children who are educated at home
  will be influenced by their parents&#39; &quot;prejudices&quot;:</p>

  <blockquote>
    One of the most important things, is that children need space away
    from their parents to find out who they really are.... At secondary
    age, children are generally embarrassed by their parents, mortified
    if they turn up at the school gates - and that&#39;s how it should
    be.... If in later life they turn out to share the same values as
    their parents then that&#39;s fine, but they need to have the
    chance to find out for themselves.<a href=
    "#N_64_"><sup>(64)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There is an official attempt in Scotland to make home schooling
  less easy for parents. In 2002, the Scottish Executive, which is the
  devolved government of the country, proposes that local authorities
  should be able to use details from the United Kingdom Census, from
  birth registers, from medical records, and from other confidential
  sources, to identify those children being educated at home. Members
  of the Scottish Parliament also tried to change the law so that
  parents who took their children out of school and then moved to
  another area would be required to inform the authorities in the same
  way as if they had stayed in the original area. Not surprisingly,
  these proposals have been bitterly fought by the home schooling
  movement - not just in Scotland, but also in the United Kingdom as a
  whole, and also from America, where there is a far larger and more
  organised movement. The law remains unchanged, but the proposals have
  not gone away.</p>

  <p>One reason given for hostility to home schooling has already been
  discussed - that children educated at home may not receive a
  &quot;suitable&quot; education. Another reason given is the general
  welfare of the children. According to John Stodter, who is the
  Director of Education in Aberdeen,</p>

  <blockquote>
    The issue here is about the protection, safety and welfare of
    children.... It&#39;s about making sure every child is known to the
    authorities. Some parents are worried that the new legislation
    means they&#39;re going to be subject to all sorts of checks but
    that&#39;s not the case. Our responsibility is simply to ensure
    some education is being provided and that the general welfare of
    the child is being looked after.<a href=
    "#N_65_"><sup>(65)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The natural implication of this is that children who do not go to
  school may, unless inspected by the authorities, suffer some kind of
  abuse by their parents. However, while there is reasonably full and
  undoubtedly sad evidence from schools and other institutions run by
  the state, there has to date been not one instance reported of
  bullying, or sexual abuse, or suicide or murder within a British
  family that educates its children at home.</p>

  <p>It is an incompetent - and even immoral - mode of argumentation to
  oppose a point of view by simply looking for psychological or other
  interested reasons for advancing that view. It is far better on all
  grounds to take the view in itself and to oppose it as incorrect in
  itself. This being said, the case against home schooling is so weak,
  and yet - in some places - so firmly advanced, that it is necessary
  to look for other reasons than whether it is incorrect in itself.
  Three reasons almost suggest themselves. There is the professional
  jealousy of teachers. There is an abstract passion to regulate. There
  is an ideological agenda.</p>

  <p><em>Professional Jealousy</em></p>

  <p>Teaching seldom brings much in the way of material reward.
  Teaching in the state sector is often morally unrewarding as well.
  Not surprisingly, teachers may feel personally offended when they
  learn that some parents do not value their contribution to
  enlightenment and civilisation. As Mark Brown puts it, home schooling
  &quot;is an absolute insult to Scotland&#39;s teachers&quot;. As the
  number of children educated at home grows, and as discussion of that
  option becomes more frequent, the various teaching unions and other
  interest groups will become more opposed to home schooling. They will
  emphasise its alleged deficiencies, and call for regulations. These
  may be light in the first instance. They may simply involve the
  identification and accurate counting of children educated at home.
  But, as has often been the case, to identify something can be the
  prelude to its strict regulation or even its effective
  prohibition.</p>

  <p><em>The Passion to Regulate</em></p>

  <p>As in the rest of the English-speaking world, Britain is subject
  to a heavy and growing weight of regulation. This is not the place to
  discuss whether any specific regulation is justified. It is enough to
  say that there is a general assumption among those who matter that
  everything that is done by the people must be known to the
  authorities and controlled by them.</p>

  <p>During the ten years to the 23<sup>rd</sup> September 2004, the
  phrase &quot;completely unregulated&quot; occurs 153 times in the
  British newspaper press. In all cases, unless used satirically, the
  phrase is part of a condemnation of some activity. We are told that
  the advertising of food to children,<a href=
  "#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a> residential lettings agents,<a href=
  "#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a> funeral directors,<a href=
  "#N_68_"><sup>(68)</sup></a> rock climbing,<a href=
  "#N_69_"><sup>(69)</sup></a> alleged communication with the
  dead,<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a> salons and tanning
  shops,<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a> contracts for extended
  warranties on home appliances,<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a>
  and anything to do with the Internet - that these are all
  &quot;almost completely unregulated&quot; or just &quot;completely
  unregulated&quot;, and that the authorities had better do something
  about the fact.</p>

  <p>Now, home schooling falls straight into this category. Though so
  far left alone by the authorities in England, it is surprising that
  this has been left alone for so long, and perhaps astonishing that
  there have been so few calls for its regulation.</p>

  <p><em>Ideological Agenda</em></p>

  <p>There is a strand of neo-Marxist thinking that claims schooling to
  be the means by which capitalism reproduces itself: it instils in
  working class children a set of values hostile to their true
  interests.<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a> In its specifics, this
  is an unlikely claim. It is true, however, in its generality. As with
  most neo-Marxist theory, it says little about what is being attacked,
  but much about the intentions of those making the attack. State
  schools do not turn out adults who believe in the rule of law and in
  free enterprise. But they often do their best to turn out adults who
  are inclined to believe in the opposite. Though state education seems
  in the urban areas of Britain to be approaching the point where
  little seems to be taught either good or bad, and the popular media
  has largely taken over the job, state education has for as long as it
  has existed been the reproduction mechanism for various kinds of
  statist ideology. Until the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, it
  was the means by which people were made into good nationalists: would
  ten million young men have marched semi-willingly to their death in
  the Great War without the prior conditioning of state education?
  Since then, it has been captured by the radical socialists.</p>

  <p>Since the 1980s, Dennis O&#39;Keeffe, now Professor of Sociology
  and the University of Buckingham, has been analysing the capture of
  education by the neo-Marxists. They dominate teacher training. They
  run the institutions, and they determine the modes of instruction.
  Student teachers are required to read and discuss and thereby absorb
  the works of Antonio Gramsci and Louis Althusser and Michel Foucault,
  among others. Professor O&#39;Keeffe describes teacher training
  as</p>

  <blockquote>
    a missionising ideology. The world is [said to be] intolerable. It
    is full of unacceptable hierarchies. It is the duty of teacher
    education, at least so far as the school-world is concerned,
    remorselessly to combat these hierarchies. All cultures are equal,
    all histories equally valid.. God is dead, but the religions of
    equal opportunity more than make up the inspirational
    deficit.<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Perhaps, as with the indoctrination of any established ideology,
  students pass without reading or read without absorbing. Even so,
  enough gets through to the class room. Professor O&#39;Keeffe finds
  that</p>

  <blockquote>
    socialist ideas pervade education.... These ideas are dangerous in
    their universalist form, when they propose Utopian equalities, and
    in their latest, separatist incarnations, where equality is
    reserved for insider groups like women, blacks and non-western
    cultures, everything male, white or western being derided and
    opposed as inferior or oppressive.<a href=
    "#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This being so, it is natural that the neo-Marxists should see home
  schooling as a challenge to their own hegemony in education. To be
  sure, these are not pantomime villains, and they do not sit about
  complaining how their &quot;conspiracy&quot; risks being frustrated.
  Instead, they believe they are doing a good and necessary job, and
  are concerned that at least some children are missing the benefits
  that they dispense.</p>

  <p>We see this explicitly in the writing of Michael W. Apple, an
  American academic. He claims that the educational policies promoted
  by a coalition of &quot;rightist&quot; groups - he calls them the
  forces of &quot;conservative modernization&quot;: neoliberals,
  neoconservatives, authoritarian populists, and &quot;the managerial
  and professional new middle class&quot;<a href=
  "#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a> - entail terrible consequences, which,
  if left unchecked, threaten all but to destroy public education in
  America. In particular, home schooling is an example of
  &quot;individualized behavior&quot; that &quot;threatens to undermine
  the quality of public education&quot;.<a href=
  "#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a></p>

  <p>He is still more explicit in a shorter work:</p>

  <blockquote>
    While it is quite probable that some specific children and families
    will gain from home schooling, my concerns are larger. They are
    connected to the more extensive restructuring of this society that
    I believe is quite dangerous and to the manner in which our very
    sense of public responsibility is withering in ways that will lead
    to even further social inequalities. In order to illuminate these
    dangers, I shall have to do a number of things: situate home
    schooling within the larger movement that provides much of its
    impetus; suggest its connections with other protectionist impulses;
    connect it to the history of and concerns about the growth of
    activist government; and, finally, point to how it may actually
    hurt many other students who are not home schooled....<br>
    <br>
    I have used this essay to raise a number of critical questions
    about the economic, social, and ideological tendencies that often
    stand behind significant parts of the home schooling movement. In
    the process, I have situated it within larger social movements that
    I and many others believe can have quite negative effects on our
    sense of community, on the health of the public sphere, and on our
    commitment to building a society that is less economically and
    racially stratified. I have suggested that issues need to be raised
    about the effects of its commitment to &#39;cocooning,&#39; its
    attack on the state, and its growing use of public funding with no
    public accountability.<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Parents who choose home schooling are taking children away from
  schools where they might otherwise be taught how to help build a new
  kind of society in which everyone will accept the common doctrines of
  political correctness.</p>

  <p><strong>Concluding Remarks</strong></p>

  <p>There can be no doubt that - whatever may be the numbers overall -
  the number of children educated at home has increased and is
  increasing. During the next few years, it is also at least reasonable
  to believe that there will be a debate over whether the numbers ought
  to be diminished. On the one side will be the supporters of an
  activist state, divided as to their motivation, but united in their
  belief that education should be supervised by the authorities. On the
  other will be the home schooling parents. Most of these may be
  hiding, and they will continue to see safety in concealment. Those
  who are visible can be expected to fight all efforts at regulation
  with a passion not seen in British politics within living memory.</p>

  <p>We may, then, be returning to something like the debates of the
  middle and late Victorian years, when education was considered more
  than just a matter of funding and standards.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left"><font size="2">It leads to increased
    control and regulation of homeschools, it forces homeschools to
    become more like conventional schools, and it weakens the
