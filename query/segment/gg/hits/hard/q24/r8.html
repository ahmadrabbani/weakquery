<P>The neoconservatives managing the federal government have created for public  
schools an anomaly of requiring testing while, at the same time, encouraging  
parental autonomy through home schooling, vouchers and charter schools. If  
education really is a state function, as provided by law, then  
careful&nbsp;attention needs to be provided for a more rigorous evaluation of  
home schooling&nbsp;processes and outcomes.  
<P>
In 1971, I was the note-taker at a meeting of the Council of Chief State  
School Officers. At that time, most of the state education chiefs were old  
enough to remember back to a time when schooling at home was a necessity, since  
there were few public schools in many areas.  
<P>These educators addressed their attention to their "responsibility to provide  
education" even to children of parents with strong religious convictions, such  
as the Amish in Ohio, some of whom still chose to teach their school-age 
children at home. Martin W. Essex, who back then was Ohios superintendent of  
public instruction and the councils president, said, "Parents who deny  
youngsters their right to go to school are failing to provide for a childs  
fundamental needs for a well-rounded education." Virtually all of his colleagues  
on the council agreed and began to vigorously enforce school-attendance laws.  
The next year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against compulsory school  
requirements. Since then, the courts generally have upheld the right of parents  
to "direct the education of their children."  
<P>
Some state courts have eliminated compulsory-education laws as beyond the  
states authority. Today, families with religious motivations continue to make  
up the homeschooling majority.  
<P>The U.S. Department of Education recently released data including the results  
of interviews conducted with the parents of 11,994 students. They indicate that:  

<P>

<P> On any given day in America, about 1.1 million children are being educated  
outside of a school, and about 2.2 percent of the total school-age population is  
homeschooled. This is a slight increase since 1999. Home schooling is recognized  
by law in Ohio, but the Ohio Department of Education posts no data on home  
schoolers. The Home School Legal Defense Association estimates 70,000 Ohio  
youngsters are home-schooled.  
<P>

<P> About 77 percent of homeschooled children are white; 81 percent are from  
two-parent households, most of them where only one parent works.  
<P>
Parents give many reasons for home schooling their children, citing concerns  
about the public school environment (85 percent), a desire to provide religious  
or moral instruction (72 percent) and dissatisfaction with academic instruction  
(68 percent).  
<P>Researchers disagree on whether home schooling is academically advantageous.  
Research has not determined whether students of similar abilities would perform  
worse or better in a classroom or at home. Experts also disagree about whether  
home schooling hinders social development, but homeschooled children spend less  
time with their peers.  
<P>
Not surprisingly, education groups believe home schooling needs more-rigorous  
regulation. Other groups, however, contend that parents have a right to teach  
their children at home by their own standards. Many educators are offended by an  
attitude among some parents of home schoolers that untrained, and sometimes  
uneducated, parents can do as well or better teaching as professionally trained  
educators. The age of the student being home-schooled appears to make a  
difference. There is only limited evidence demonstrating the value of academic  
preparation at the elementary level. On the other hand, many studies have  
revealed that strong teacher preparation in secondary-school fields, such as  
science and mathematics, leads to higher achievement by students.  
<P>One other valid concern is that many people claim to be homeschooling 
children who simply might be truant.  
<P>
While home schooling appears to meet the needs of some families, society must  
consider whether it erodes support for public schools.
