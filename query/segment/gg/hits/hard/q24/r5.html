		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions about Home Schooling</h1>

  			<blockquote>
				<p align="right"><b><a href="homeschool.htm">
				<font color="#000000">Return</font></a></b></p>
			</blockquote>
  <p><b>What should I know?</b></p>
  <p>Home schooling is deregulated in the state of Colorado, therefore, you are 
    taking on all of the responsibility for your student's education including 
    acquisition of books, supplies, tests, and maintaining permanent records. </p>
    
 <p>A parent who intends to establish a nonpublic home-based education program is not required to:</p> 
<blockquote>
(I) Provide written notification of the program to a school district within the state until the parent's
 child is six years of age; <br><br>
(II) Establish the program until the parent's child is seven years of age; or <br><br>
(III) Continue the program or provide the notification after the child is sixteen years of age.
</blockquote>
    
  <p><b>How do I get started, what do I do first?</b></p>
  <p>You must provide a 14-day written notification explaining your intent to 
    home school to any <a href="http://www.cde.state.co.us/scripts/districtprofiles/k12schlwebsites.asp">
	Colorado public school district office</a> (for each child) and do 
    so each year thereafter for each year the program is maintained.  
	This written notification must be given 14 days before you establish your program. 
	(3)(e). You'll 
    need to make your school district of residence aware of the district where 
    you've registered to avoid truancy action. The notification must list the 
    child's name, age, place of residence and number of hours of attendance of each 
    child enrolled.</p>
  <p><b>Where do I get textbooks, curricula, tests and other materials to home school my child, 
    and what are the costs?</b></p>
  <p>Contact an organization at <a href="homeschool_resources.htm"> Home School Resources</a>, bookstores, 
    supply houses or your local school district, and they may be able to provide you 
    with information on how to obtain materials. Home schooling costs vary because you 
    can purchase entire programs from private companies or create your own 
    curriculum. All costs are assumed by the parent.</p>
  <p><b>What requirements or qualifications must I have to home school my child?</b></p>
  <p>You must be the child's parent, legal guardian or adult relative designated 
	by the parent. There are no 
    other qualifications or requirements. (2)(a)</p>
  <p><b>What are the requirements for attendance?</b></p>
  <p>Your program shall include no less than 172 days of instruction, averaging 
    four instructional contact hours per day. (3)(c)</p>
  <p><b>What subjects do I have to teach?</b></p>
  <p>Your program shall include, but is not limited to: communication skills of 
    reading, writing and speaking, mathematics, history, civics, literature, science 
    and regular courses of instruction in the constitution of
      the United States as provided in section 22-1-108. (3)(d)</p>
  <p><b>What kind of records do I have to keep?</b></p>
  <p>Your records must include but are not limited to, attendance data, test and 
    evaluation results and immunization records. (3)(g)</p>
  <p><b>Do I have to test my child and who pays for the test? Where do I get the 
    test?</b></p>
  <p>Your child must take a nationally standardized achievement test when he/she reaches grades
  three, five, seven, nine, and eleven to evaluate academic progress, or a qualified person must
    evaluate your child's academic progress at your expense. Contact an organization 
    at <a href="homeschool_resources.htm">Home School Resources</a>, or 
	check with your local school district to see if your child can be included during the 
	nationally standardized testing of public
    school students. The district is not obliged to include your child and may charge you
    for any costs incurred. It is the parent's obligation to report the test or
    evaluation results to the school district that received the written 
	notification,
    or report the test or evaluation results to an independent or parochial school.*
    If the parent submitted the test or evaluation results to an independent or
    parochial school, the name of the school must be provided to the school district
    that received the written notification. (3)(f)<br>
 


 <br>
    
    *NOTE: If your child is enrolled in a home school co-op program, it is still the
    parent's obligation to report test/evaluation results to the school district.</p>
  <p>For locations of testing contact one of the organizations listed on the 
	<a href="homeschool_resources.htm">Home School Resources</a> page.</p>
  <p><b>Is my home schooled child required to take the CSAP test?</b></p>
  <p>No. Home schooled children are required to take a nationally standardized 
	test, not the CSAP, which is a state assessment test. However, if a parent or legal guardian
	 requests it a district shall permit a home schooled student to take the CSAP and provide 
    the results of the assessment to the parent or legal guardian. The test is given 
    only to home schooled students whose parents request that the child participate 
    in the testing. 22-7-409 (III)(1.3)(b)
    
  </p>
  <p><b>Is there a state diploma or can my child earn one from the district?</b></p>
  <p>There is no state diploma. District diplomas are presented only to 
    students who have attended a public high school in the district. Some companies 
    selling home schooling curricula offer a diploma at the completion of their 
    program. Or, the parent can purchase a diploma at an office supply store or 
	make a diploma on a pc to present at the completion of the 
    program.</p>
  <p><b>How can I find support groups or information on the Internet?</b></p>
  <p><a href="homeschool_resources.htm">Home School Resources</a> is a list of resource and support groups 
	you can contact with your questions and concerns. These organizations have information for those 
	new to home schooling--or those with past experience, and may be able to 
    provide you with information for support groups in your area. Parents with 
    home schooling experience are your best sources of information. You might 
	also search the Internet or check with community groups and organizations for additional information.</p>
	<p>NOTE: If your child is enrolled in a home school co-op program, those teaching your child must 
	be qualified. A qualified person means an individual who is selected by the parent of a child who is
	participating in a nonpublic home-based educational program to evaluate such child's progress
	and who is a teacher licensed pursuant to article 60.5 of this title, a teacher who is employed
	by an independent or parochial school, a licensed psychologist, or a person with a graduate degree in education. </p>		
	
  <p><b>Does my homeschooled child have to take the GED?</b></p>
  <p>No. The adult in charge of the program may 
    graduate the student by simply issuing a diploma. However, taking the
	<a href="http://www.cde.state.co.us/cdeadult/GEDindex.htm"> GED</a> is an option.</p>
  <p><b>Is there any funding available for homeschooling?</b></p>
  <p>At the time of this update, there is no funding available.</p>
