Rhonda's Typical Homeschooling Day   There may be some of you new to homeschooling, or considering it, that may wonder what a homeschool day consists of. Of course, this varies  widely among different families, but here is how our day  typically unfolds. My three children are usually up by 8:00 a.m., have breakfast and do a few chores while breakfast is prepared. We typically begin our homeschool curriculum by 9:00. I have two second graders and one fifth grader. It's easy to incorporate a few of the subjects with both grades and we can work together as a group. When it's necessary to split up, I work with one grade while the other student works on their Time4Learning curriculum online and then we later switch.  The children love their Time4Learning experiences and quite often, I find that they learn a new concept only after covering it on Time4Learning! The second graders are usually finished with all curriculum by noon and my fifth grader usually finishes by 1:00 or 2:00 p.m. depending on the day, as we cover more subjects on some days. We typically review spelling in the evening and make time for more reading before bedtime. So, there you have a typical homeschool day in our household!

Choosing A Homeschool Curriculum California homeschool law includes the freedom for families to pick and choose their own curriculum based on what works best for their child. However, families new to homeschooling quickly discover a dizzying array of choices when it comes to selecting homeschool curriculum. There is no more popular discussion among homeschoolers on the web than the pros and cons of various homeschool curriculum. After sifting through the homeschool curriculum reviews, most parents end up mixing and matching homeschool preograms, trying to create the best match for their child. For families with more than one child, choosing a homeschool curriculum can even be more problematic. What works for one child, may not work for another. What works for one subject may not work on the next. What works one year, may fall flat the very next year. Time4Learning's experience shows that there is no single, best homeschool material. Rather than feeling torn between homeschool resources, parents should select a diverse blend of materials and activities. Some of the features that make Time4Learning so successful include: Time4Learning appeals to a wide range of learning styles. Our online learning materials are especially well-suited to children who are  visual or kinesthetic learners . These children can take advantage of Time4Learning's interactive, multimedia materials.

Parents like that it tracks progress and helps children advance by clearly presenting and reinforcing each lesson. Quizzes and tests are graded by the computer, saving valuable time and effort for parents who would be happier concentrating on other areas. Time4Learning's self-paced, modularized  lesson plans allow you to move forward and back through the materials whenever you want.
