Home schooling is deregulated in the state of Colorado, therefore, you are taking on all of the responsibility for your student's education including acquisition of books, supplies, tests, and maintaining permanent records.  A parent who intends to establish a nonpublic home-based education program is not required to: (I) Provide written notification of the program to a school district within the state until the parent's child is six years of age;  (II) Establish the program until the parent's child is seven years of age; or  (III) Continue the program or provide the notification after the child is sixteen years of age.  How do I get started, what do I do first?  You must provide a 14-day written notification explaining your intent to home school to any  Colorado public school district office (for each child) and do so each year thereafter for each year the program is maintained. This written notification must be given 14 days before you establish your program. (3)(e). You'll need to make your school district of residence aware of the district where you've registered to avoid truancy action. The notification must list the child's name, age, place of residence and number of hours of attendance of each child enrolled. Where do I get textbooks, curricula, tests and other materials to home school my child, and what are the costs?  Contact an organization at  Home School Resources , bookstores, supply houses or your local school district, and they may be able to provide you with information on how to obtain materials. Home schooling costs vary because you can purchase entire programs from private companies or create your own curriculum. All costs are assumed by the parent. What requirements or qualifications must I have to home school my child?  You must be the child's parent, legal guardian or adult relative designated by the parent. There are no other qualifications or requirements. (2)(a) What are the requirements for attendance?  Your program shall include no less than 172 days of instruction, averaging four instructional contact hours per day. (3)(c) What subjects do I have to teach?  Your program shall include, but is not limited to: communication skills of reading, writing and speaking, mathematics, history, civics, literature, science and regular courses of instruction in the constitution of the United States as provided in section 22-1-108. (3)(d) What kind of records do I have to keep?  Your records must include but are not limited to, attendance data, test and evaluation results and immunization records. (3)(g) Do I have to test my child and who pays for the test? Where do I get the test?  Your child must take a nationally standardized achievement test when he/she reaches grades three, five, seven, nine, and eleven to evaluate academic progress, or a qualified person must evaluate your child's academic progress at your expense. Contact an organization at  Home School Resources , or check with your local school district to see if your child can be included during the nationally standardized testing of public school students. The district is not obliged to include your child and may charge you for any costs incurred. It is the parent's obligation to report the test or evaluation results to the school district that received the written notification, or report the test or evaluation results to an independent or parochial school.* If the parent submitted the test or evaluation results to an independent or parochial school, the name of the school must be provided to the school district that received the written notification. (3)(f) *NOTE: If your child is enrolled in a home school co-op program, it is still the parent's obligation to report test/evaluation results to the school district. For locations of testing contact one of the organizations listed on the  Home School Resources page. Is my home schooled child required to take the CSAP test?  No. Home schooled children are required to take a nationally standardized test, not the CSAP, which is a state assessment test. However, if a parent or legal guardian requests it a district shall permit a home schooled student to take the CSAP and provide the results of the assessment to the parent or legal guardian. The test is given only to home schooled students whose parents request that the child participate in the testing. 22-7-409 (III)(1.3)(b)  Is there a state diploma or can my child earn one from the district?  There is no state diploma. District diplomas are presented only to students who have attended a public high school in the district. Some companies selling home schooling curricula offer a diploma at the completion of their program. Or, the parent can purchase a diploma at an office supply store or make a diploma on a pc to present at the completion of the program. How can I find support groups or information on the Internet?  Home School Resources is a list of resource and support groups you can contact with your questions and concerns. These organizations have information for those new to home schooling--or those with past experience, and may be able to provide you with information for support groups in your area. Parents with home schooling experience are your best sources of information. You might also search the Internet or check with community groups and organizations for additional information. NOTE: If your child is enrolled in a home school co-op program, those teaching your child must be qualified. A qualified person means an individual who is selected by the parent of a child who is participating in a nonpublic home-based educational program to evaluate such child's progress and who is a teacher licensed pursuant to article 60.5 of this title, a teacher who is employed by an independent or parochial school, a licensed psychologist, or a person with a graduate degree in education.  Does my homeschooled child have to take the GED?  No. The adult in charge of the program may graduate the student by simply issuing a diploma. However, taking the  GED is an option. Is there any funding available for homeschooling?  At the time of this update, there is no funding available.
