Mr. Alkhatib reasoned that, with a youthful, fashion-conscious population that loves online convenience, the region would be an excellent location in which to start an online retailer.   In November 2010, he left Silicon Valley to launch the online flash-sales shopping club MarkaVIP in Jordan, and in March opened centers in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. Shopping clubs require membership and offer sales at discounted prices for a limited period; flash sales are bargain offers that are available for a very limited time, sometimes only hours. By working with clothing companies that need to get rid of excess inventory, MarkaVIP offers thousands of designer-label fashions at bargain-basement prices.   MarkaVIP Ahmed Alkhatib is founder and chief executive of MarkaVIP, a shopping club that offers bargains on designer-label fashions for a limited period of time.     Today, the site has 600,000 members and more than 100,000 fans on Facebook. Mr. Alkhatib talked to The Wall Street Journal in Beirut about the consumer potential of the Middle East.  WSJ: Why did you decide to leave Silicon Valley for the Middle East?  Mr. Alkhatib: I was with [personalized product online retailer] Zazzle for 4½ years. I set up their data-center operations and built infrastructure of high-volume e-commerce. After four years, the job became more maintenance. I got the idea for MarkaVIP after learning about [online shopping club] KupiVIP in Russia. I was surprised that this business model worked in Russia, which is behind the Middle East in credit-card penetration.   They offered cash on delivery and a fleet of cars. With my co-founder from Jordan, we raised our first million dollars from Hummingbird Ventures in Belgium.  We launched the company in November 2010, and our first month's revenue was 10 times what was projected, so we expanded in January 2011 to Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. In March, we launched in the rest of the GCC [the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates].  WSJ: How did you decide the timing of your move?  Mr. Alkhatib: In 2009, the stock market had taken a toll on companies, and I wanted a fresh start. At that time, online companies had just started setting up shop in the Middle East, and it was almost a virgin market. Then Maktoob happened [when  Yahoo acquired the Arabic email service provider] and that was an inspiration. I thought if I got in at the beginning, it would be a big advantage.  WSJ: Why do you think your business model has been so successful?  Mr. Alkhatib: I thought this business would work in the Middle East because the region has a very young population, and the people are aware of brands and fashion. A lot of buying habits are influenced by the West. We offer brands that are too expensive for people to buy at bricks-and-mortar stores. And we offer the same quality at much better prices, with an easy 21-day return policy and a no-risk cash-on-delivery system.  Saudi Arabia, where shopping isn't convenient for women, comprises 40% of our market. Enlarge Image      Close     MarkaVIP Today, the site has 600,000 members.     We offer 30 to 40 Arab designers and more than 1,000 different brands, 40 of which aren't available at shops in the Middle East. We work with up-and-coming brands, so we also set trends.  WSJ: What are the main challenges you've faced?  Mr. Alkhatib: There are primitive logistics from a business-to-customer perspective, and not all shipping methods are optimized. Cross-border transportation is also a big challenge. We've established direct relationships with government agencies and clearance houses, which has helped with importing goods.  We plan to solve the logistics problems by having a fulfillment center in each country. We are working closely with government agencies to affect the regulatory environment and allow for a more efficient and faster import process for our goods. Also, consumers are still a bit leery of buying online. We have 600,000 members, and we have to teach them the benefits of shopping online.  We haven't been affected by the regional unrest because—so far—the countries where we have opened have been stable. But we want to open in Egypt, Iraq and Syria, once peace returns. Based on what we've already seen, there's potential for a huge market in those countries.  WSJ: Where do you see e-commerce going in the Middle East?  Mr. Alkhatib: It's inevitable that, like Europe and the [United] States, we'll see people having more online shops, wherever they can save money and have variety. You'll see people buying medicine and household products online. And governments will offer more services online. But [the increase in online services and penetration] will be at a slower rate than the U.S. or Europe.  WSJ: Do Middle Eastern customers want different things from e-commerce than those in the U.S.? Different products? Different levels of service?  Mr. Alkhatib: Customer service is important. Arab consumers need on-demand customer service. That's the ability to respond to customer requests immediately through our support center, email, Facebook page, Twitter and other mediums. We follow up to customer complaints, requests, questions within minutes of our customers reaching out to us.   Lingerie is one of our most popular products, because a lot of women don't feel comfortable going into lingerie shops that are mostly managed by men. Eyewear is another popular item because, unlike footwear, sizing isn't an issue. We eventually plan on selling lifestyle products, such as apartments and cars.
