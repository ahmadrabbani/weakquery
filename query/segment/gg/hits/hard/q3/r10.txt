"The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will interest his patients in the care of the human frame, in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease." - Thomas Edison   The American Cancer Society removed hyperthermia from its "Unproven Methods" list in 1975.    FDA approved hyperthermia   Children who sauna regularly have half as many ear infections, colds and other upper respiratory problems.  A weekly sauna provides a social encounter during which families and friends gather to share stories, laugh and play.  A sauna can be a good opportunity to listen to music or meditate.  The Finnish people have long contended that weekly saunas are an essential part of preventing disease and living a long life.  Vigorous rubbing of the skin during a bath, shower or sauna helps remove old dead skin, stimulates circulation and aids the elimination of toxins.   A lower temperature sauna (105°-110°F) taken for a longer time (45-90 minutes) is more beneficial.  -  Schmidt page 127.  For detoxification, a low temperature sauna can be taken 5 to 7 days a week for three months and then 3 days a week for three months (under a doctor's supervision). -  Schmidt page 128.  Supplemental nutrients such as flax oil,  B vitamins (especially niacin), vitamins C, E and beta-carotine, and trace minerals such as zinc, magnesium, calcium, organic germanium, and selenium help to bind toxins or minimize their effect on the body.  Dietary supplements together with vigorous exercise followed by a sauna is a proven system for detoxification.  Never use a sauna unattended if you are ill. Never use a sauna for medical treatment without consultation with a physician.  Some health professionals say that pregnant women should not undergo detoxification because toxins released from fat stores can expose the fetus.  In  Finland , pregnant women are said to enjoy saunas without difficulty, and even find them relaxing places to give birth.   We suggest that any girl who plans to become a mother should take care not to allow toxic chemicals to build up in her body, and should enjoy regular detoxification (such as saunas) as part of her healthy lifestyle prior to becoming pregnant.  Health problems that can be helped by saunas include cancer, ADD/ADHD, fibromyalgia, chemical exposures, problems due to silicone breast implants, acne and other skin problems, chemical sensitivities, chronic infections, recurrent infections, toxins from mold, chronic fatigue, lethargy, depression, headaches, allergies, muscle aches, joint pains,...  Substances found in sweat following a sauna include: mercury, lead, cadmium, PCB's, PBB, DDT, DDE, hexachlor- benzene (HCB), dioxin (agent orange), petrochemicals, volatile organic chemicals (solvents), pesticides, herbicides, drugs  For many of these chemicals, hyperthermia is the only known way to remove them from the human body.  Benefits include improved liver and immune function and may include prevention of future cancers and birth defects in offspring.  The   DNA  is damaged in 85% of human sperm.   50%  of American babies are not healthy.  Industries involved with toxic chemicals should provide saunas for workers, their families and the community.  The Bio-Tox Reduction Program consists of: - diet - exercise - sauna baths - niacin - EDTA chelation  Chelation therapy includes recommen- dations for diet, nutritional supplements, and exercise to help prevent regression.  The most common cancer in both men and women is lung cancer. Breathing the warm air of a sauna is a good way to heat the lungs.  Chemical pocket warmers applied to Bowen's disease (a precancerous skin tumor) daily for up to 5 months, resulted in tumor remission for 6 of 8 patients. -  Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology 2000;43: 1070-1075.

The first section is from his book   Cancer Causes, Prevention and Treatment, The Total Approach  , Health Plus Publishers, Sherwood, Oregon, 1993. His books present many other types of therapeutic baths than are discussed here. It is good to have alternative treatments for cancer that do not involve eating, because nausea or cancers of the digestive system may make eating difficult.    Artificially Induced Fever   "Give me a chance to create a fever and I will cure any disease," said the great ancient physician Parmenides. Many modern giants of biological medicine in Europe, such as the Nobel Prize winner, Dr. A. Lwoff,41 famous German cancer specialist, Prof. Werner Zabel,42 and the director of the  most successful cancer clinic in the world , the Ringberg-Klinik, Dr. Josef Issels, use artificially induced fever in their battle against cancer.42  Dr. Werner Zabel told the following true story, which illustrates the  cancer-preventive and cancer-healing effect of artificially induced fever:  Not far from Rome, Italy, there were huge swampy areas called the Pontine Swamps. These swamps were excellent breeding grounds for malaria mosquitoes, and the whole area was affected by malaria.  Then, by government action, the Pontine Swamps were drained and dried out. As a result malaria completely disappeared. But Italian medical researchers made a remarkable observation. While earlier the whole malaria-infected area was  completely free from cancer , now, one generation later, it had the same prevalence of cancer as the rest of Italy. The scientists concluded that the frequent fever attacks common in malaria stimulated the body's own defenses so that  cancer could not develop .  Fever has been too long a misunderstood and mistreated symptom. Most orthodox doctors try to combat and suppress fever. Actually fever is a constructive, health-promoting symptom, initiated and created by the body in its own effort to fight infections and other conditions of disease and to restore health. High temperature speeds up metabolism, inhibits the growth of invading virus or bacteria and accelerates the healing processes.  In folk medicine in various parts of the world fever has been used for centuries to heal disease. In the West Indies, natives afflicted with syphilis or  cancer cured themselves by deliberately subjecting themselves to infection from such high fever diseases as malaria, typhus fever or typhoid fever.  Dr. A. Lwoff, famous French bacteriologist, has demonstrated in repeated scientific experiments that fever is indeed a "great medicine," and that it can help to cure many "incurable diseases". In biological clinics in Europe, artificially induced fever, mostly in the form of overheating baths, has been used successfully to treat such conditions as rheumatic diseases, skin disorders, insomnia, arthritis - and  cancer . Dr. Josef Issels has said, "Artificially induced fever has the greatest potential in the treatment of many diseases,  including cancer ." Mark well that  this remark is made by one of the leading cancer specialists in the world!   The usual method of inducing fever is the so-called Schlenzbath.43 The patient is totally immersed in a large bathtub filled with water between 100-102  degrees Fahrenheit. Only the nose and mouth are left free for breathing. In about half an hour, the body's temperature will gradually rise to match the temperature of the water.  Needless to say, treatment should be given by the nurse and should be well supervised. The temperature of the water and of the patient, and the patient's pulse, should be checked periodically.  Detailed instructions for administering the Schlenz-bath are given in my book,  How To Get Well .43    The following section comes from the book by Paavo Airola, Ph.D., N.D.,   How to Get Well  , Health Plus Publishers, Sherwood, Oregon, 1993. The letters "N.D." after Dr. Airola's name indicate that he is a "Naturopathic Doctor". Naturopathic physicians have long been interested in alternative treatments for cancer and may be of great assistance to you.   Directions: 7   THERAPEUTIC BATHS   How to use or administer overheating baths, sitz baths, sauna, hot-and-cold shower, Kneipp baths, salt water baths, etc.   Water has been used for remedial purposes since time immemorial. Natives in various parts of the earth, sought the healing effect of natural waters, mineral springs, sea water, rivers and springs. When medical science saw its birth, healing disease with water was recognized as one of the most important therapeutic modalities. Hippocrates, Celus, Galen  and other ancient greats of medicine praised water for its many curative properties. In all major ancient civilizations, bathing was held in esteem  not only for its remedial properties, but as an important health-building  and disease-preventive measure.  In modern times, the therapeutic properties of water were popularized by Father Kneipp, Maria Schlenz, Priessnitz, and other European water-cure pioneers. There are hundreds of Spas and "Bads" in most European countries where therapeutic baths are used as a major healing measure, especially so-called Kneipp-baths. As Father Kneipp said, "Water contains great healing power" - and millions of yearly visitors to these "bads" can testify that water, indeed, does possess great therapeutic value.  Here are some therapeutic baths that can be employed in healing the sick and in preventing disease. Some of these, like overheating baths, should be supervised by a doctor or nurse, but most can be employed in a do-it-yourself manner in your own home.   OVERHEATING THERAPY   "Give me a chance to create fever and I will cure any disease," said the great physician, Parmenides, 2,000 years ago.  Fever is one of the body's own defensive and healing forces, created and sustained for the deliberate purpose of restoring health. The high temperature speeds up metabolism, inhibits the growth of the invading virus or bacteria, and literally burns the enemy with heat. Fever is an effective protective and healing measure not only against colds and simple infections, but against such serious diseases as polio and  cancer. In biological clinics, overheating therapies or artificially induced fever are used effectively in the treatment of acute infectious diseases, arthritis and rheumatic diseases, skin disorders, insomnia, muscular pain and  cancer , to name a few conditions. Such giants of medical science as Nobel Prize Winner, Dr. A. Lwoff, Dr. Werner Zabel, and Dr. Josef Issels, recommend and use fever therapies extensively. Recently, a research team under the direction of Dr. David S. Muchles, from Oxford University, reported that the studies confirmed what ancient physicians and biological doctors knew all along - that fever is effective in combating many diseases,  including cancer .  There are many ways to induce fever. Some doctors use certain vaccines (like BCG) or drugs to create artificial fever. Personally, I prefer a more natural approach. Although fever induced with BCG or drugs can have a beneficial effect by "waking up" and stimulating the body's natural defensive and immunological mechanism, there is less stress on the body if fever is induced with an overheating bath. Schlenz-bath has been used for this purpose for nearly a century.    SCHLENZ-BATH   Here's how the curative Schlenz-bath is administered. First, the patient should not eat for at least two hours before treatment. If possible, the bladder and the colon should be emptied. The bath tub should be as large and as deep as possible. If a regular American bath tub is used, you may need to plug the emergency outlet to raise the water to the top of the tub.  The patient must be  totally covered with water,  including his head; only his nose, eyes and mouth - and as little as possible of them should be left uncovered. Start with a low temperature of about 95 degrees, or about the temperature of the skin. Let warm water run slowly from the faucet and stir constantly. In 15 to 20 minutes, bring the temperature in the tub to about 100 degrees; later to about 103 or even slightly higher, depending on the patient's reaction.  The length of the treatment is about one hour. Although the temperature of the water is not too high, when the patient is totally covered by the water there is no heat escaping from the body and its temperature will invariably rise to match the temperature of the water.  The Schlenz-bath, if given to sick patients, must be supervised. The pulse should not go over 130 or 140. The temperature of the water should be monitored at all times with a bath thermometer. If the patient feels any discomfort, he should be raised out of the water to a sitting position for a while. It is also recommended that the nurse massage the patient with a bristle brush during the bath. This brings the blood to the surface of the skin and relieves the heart from undue pressure.   SAUNA   A sauna, or Finnish steam bath, is another excellent way to benefit from overheating therapy. In addition to an artificially induced fever, which a prolonged steam bath always accomplishes, the sauna bath is specifically conducive to profuse therapeutic sweating.  The skin is our largest eliminative organ - "the third kidney." It is generally considered that the skin should eliminate 30 percent of the body wastes by way of perspiration. Due to lack of physical work and an overly sedentary life, the skin of most people today has degenerated as an eliminative organ, since it is hardly ever subjected to sweating. If health is to be restored, it is of vital importance that the eliminative activity of the skin is revitalized. Taking sauna or steam baths regularly, once or twice a week, will help to restore and revitalize the cleansing activity of the skin.  The therapeutic property of the sauna is attributed to the following facts:  Overheating stimulates and speeds up the metabolic processes and inhibits the growth of virus and bacteria.  All the vital organs and glands are stimulated to increased activity.  The body's healing forces are aided and assisted, and healing is accelerated.  The eliminative, detoxifying and cleansing capacity of the skin is dramatically increased by the profuse sweating.    DO-IT-YOURSELF SAUNA   If you do not have your own sauna, and have no easy access to a sauna, you can make a do-it-yourself sauna in your own bedroom, as follows:  First take a hot bath, as hot as you can stand. Then dry yourself and wrap in a heavy bath towel. Put a plastic or rubber sheet on your bed to protect it from damage by perspiration. Lie on the rubber sheet, take a couple of hotwater bottles and  cover yourself with an electric blanket, turned on high, leaving just a crack for breathing. Use several heavy blankets, if necessary. Remain in bed while profuse sweating occurs half an hour or more. Finish with a shower.  NOTE: Although fever is a natural, constructive, beneficial symptom, and fever therapy is one of the most effective means in the arsenal of biological modalities, I must stress the fact that fever therapy should always be supervised by an expert practitioner and undertaken on the advice of a doctor. The patient's heart condition, his ability to perspire and his general vitality should be checked and his reaction during the therapy closely supervised. Also, the length of the overheating therapy, and the dosage of fever-inducing drugs (if they are used), should be determined by the doctor.  The above warning is in regard to patients who are ill. There is, of course, no danger for  healthy  people to take sauna or other steam or hot baths, or even a Schlenz-bath, on a regular basis as a preventive, cleansing and health-building measure, as millions of people are doing both here and in Europe.   End of quotes from writings of Paavo Airola, Ph.D., N.D. We highly recommend that you obtain and read Dr. Airola's books.    The Thermometer   Hyperthermia is a hit or miss affair without a good thermometer. After looking in several drug stores without success for a bath thermometer, we found a satisfactory thermometer at a Pool & Spa store. We compared the readings from several thermometers in the rack to make sure they all produced the same result. The one we selected floats, has large lines and numbers so it is easy to read, has scales for both Fahrenheit and Celcius, and cost less than $10. The 38°C mark lines up with 100°F, the 42°C mark lines up with 108°F and we keep our bath water hovering right in this temperature range while we soak up the warmth. These temperatures are only slightly above body temperature and are not hot. The secret is nearly total immersion.  This simple thermometer has converted our bath tub into a state-of-the-art whole body hyperthermia system. Remarkable!   For best results:  (Optional) Fill your tub from the shower if it is equipped with a filter to remove chlorine. Or go to a pet store and buy chlorine - neutralizing drops sold for fish tanks.  (Optional) Add epsom salts to the bath water to create a mineral bath. You might also add a pint of   3% hydrogen peroxide  to oxygenate and sanitize the water for multiple users.    If necessary, block the bathtub overflow hole (duct tape works well) so that the water is deep enough to cover the entire body.  Scrub your body from time to time during your bath to remove dead skin and open the pores.  Go slowly and carefully when getting out of the tub. You may be a little light-headed.  During and afterwards, drink plenty of fluids such as water and juices to replace water, minerals and salt lost in the sweat.  Combine hyperthermia with exercise and dietary supplementation for maximum results.  Do for 45 - 90 minutes daily 5 days a week (in consultation with your physician) if you have a health problem, and weekly to prevent health problems.    When traveling on an airplane, be sure to put your bath thermometer in your checked luggage. Airport security rules may prohibit thermometers in carry on baggage.        Heat the Brain?   Ayurveda suggests that it is not good to heat the brain. The Ayurvedic heat treatment called swedena heats the body but not the head.   However, we should keep in mind that Ayurveda places GREAT emphasis on PREVENTION of disease and maintenance of good health. Anyone who enjoys swedena and other Ayurvedic preventive treatments regularly will probably not get cancer.  It takes many years for a cancer tumor to grow large enough for you to notice. During these years there is a good chance the tumor has been shedding cells and the cancer has metastasized to many other locations in your body, including the brain. If this has happened and you survive long enough, you will find these tumors sprouting like mushrooms all over the place. Whole body hyperthermia will heat these cancer cells wherever they may be.    Therefore, our conclusion is that when using hyperthermia to prevent disease, follow the Ayurvedic rule and do not heat the brain. However, when using hyperthermia to fight cancer, there is a good chance that the cancer has already spread to the brain. Exposing the brain to low temperature hyperthermia seems safer than the higher temperatures (140°F or more) found in traditional saunas.  On the other hand, purists who refuse to heat their brain can take recourse in the   abscopal effect  . The abscopal effect appears only in the presence of a functioning immune system. The abscopal effect is when treating cancer in one area of the body results in cancer in other areas of the body also shrinking. This is due to the treated area reducing the burden on the immune system, releasing immune system resources to attack cancer in other areas. There is experimental evidence that treating cancer with hyperthermia in ANY area of the body improves the body's ability to fight cancer in EVERY area of the body. So hop into the hot tub and enjoy!  We suggest you obtain a thermometer and follow Dr. Airola's therapeutic bath instructions carefully, or buy / build yourself a sauna.         Far Infrared Sauna   If you are interested in purchasing a home sauna, you might have a look at the new far infrared saunas. There are two kinds of heat - convection heat and radiant heat. Convection heat uses a medium such as air to carry warmth from the heat source to your body. Radiant heat uses a frequency of light that resonates with water molecules. This frequency of light is called "far infrared". Far infrared heat is safe, being the same kind of heat that warms you in sunlight or in front of a fire. If you have ever held your hand over a flashlight, you will know that light penetrates the body. Unlike convection heat which just warms the skin, far infrared penetrates several centimeters below the surface of the body. Due to this deep heating effect, a far infrared sauna produces much more sweat.  ***  Economical Portable Far Infrared Sauna  Economical portable far infrared sauna is available for home use. Contains four far infrared heating panels in walls and non-far infrared heated foot pad.   Plug directly into your 110 volt 15 amp household wall outlet. No plumbing is required.  There are many suppliers of this sauna on the Internet. Ebay is a good source. Look for a larger model offering more leg room, and make sure that the seller offers a warranty.       We purchased one of these for our own use. For years we have wanted a far infrared sauna, but have been deterred by the multi-thousand dollar price and a desire to somehow avoid heating the brain. This economical sauna costing only a few hundred dollars and having a design that does not heat the head is just what we wanted. The sauna comes with a digital temperature control and we monitor the temperature with the same thermometer we use in our bath.  The far infrared heats deep into the body and the sweat pours off. This is the advantage of far infrared - one does not need to experience the burning heat of a traditional sauna to get a good sweat.  For cleanliness, we put one small towel on the chair and another around the neck. This keeps the sauna clean by preventing contact with these parts of the sauna, and the towels soak up the sweat. Afterwards, we use the towels to wipe the inside of the sauna.       Male Birth Control   The low temperatures (108°F / 42°C) recommended for hyperthermia should not affect male fertility. However, Dr. Voegel from Switzerland found that higher temperatures could be intentionally used to create temporary male sterilization. Dr. Voegel found that immersing the testes only in a 116°F bath for 45 minutes daily for three weeks would result in temporary sterility for six months.   According to Dr. David Williams  Alternatives newsletter October 2002, during the 1930's through the 1950's Dr. Voegel "taught hundreds of men this procedure to help them keep from getting their wives pregnant...During the 20 years he practiced this technique, he found no adverse effects. Some individuals were able to sustain temperatures as high as 125 degrees F, but 116 degrees F was comfortable enough to be tolerated by everyone, and it reliably kept the men infertile for six months. After the six months, their fertility would either gradually return to normal, or they could repeat the process for another six months of protection. In the mid-1950's, the Japanese government expressed an interest in Dr. Voegel's work, and after careful studies and evaluations of their own, they found the technique to be very effective...This may sound like a lot of trouble or inconvenience, but it's another one of these low-tech tools that costs little, works, and can be used anywhere by anyone."  ***  Here are alternatives to "the pill" for women  1 ,  2 .     Hyperthermia gives cancer a triple whammy by: 1. removing accumulations of stored toxic chemicals that cause cancer 2. improving circulation so that tissues are both nourished with oxygen and flushed of acidic metabolic wastes 3. weakening or even killing cancer cells that have a lower tolerance for heat than healthy cells.  This makes regular hyperthermia an excellent addition to a healthy cancer-preventing lifestyle and a useful part of a comprehensive program to remove cancer. Hyperthermia to detoxify the body is most effective if used together with exercise and enhanced nutrition.  It is possible to overdo a good thing. "In the tissue culture the cancer cell will be damaged by a temperature of 39° C. and dies at 42° C.; the normal cell will be damaged by 43° C. and dies at 46-47° C." - Professor Lambert, quoted in  Gerson page 45. Cancer cells damaged by hyperthermia are much more easily killed by other means, so hyperthermia works well as a complementary therapy.  If you are using hyperthermia for therapeutic purposes find a doctor to work with who knows about hyperthermia. Also, if you are having a sauna frequently, be sure to supplement your diet with calcium, magnesium and trace minerals to replace beneficial minerals lost in the sweat.  "For many patients, battling cancer has also meant fighting constant pain, or relying on strong narcotics like demerol or morphine derivatives.  Hyperthermia is an excellent alternative to the use of these addictive drugs. Not only it is an effective cancer treatment, but it  often dramatically reduces pain which allows for better quality of life. Subsequently, this enables many people to devote more energy to their fight against cancer." -  Valley Cancer Institute   We find that a hot bath (108°F / 42°C) is very effective to relieve pain, nausea and other discomfort. Since it is free and simple, why not give it a try? Hyperthermia is on our list of non-drug ways to deal with   cancer pain  .  Chelators bond to a toxic metal ion and form a stable complex that can be removed from the body. The herb cilantro helps remove metals such as  mercury, lead and aluminum from the body. Cilantro is a kind of parsley and is widely available in grocery stores. The seeds of the cilantro plant are commonly known as "coriander". Chop the cilantro finely and mix in soups and salads to cleanse these metals from your body. Malic acid (found in apples and apple cider vinegar) helps remove aluminum from the body. Other natural chelators include vitamin C, sulphur-containing amino acids such as methionine and cysteine (whey powder is a good source of these amino acids), yellow dock root, and chlorella.     Iodine chelates metals  such as    mercury, lead, cadmium and aluminum and halogens such as fluoride and bromide   .    Iodine also removes  perchlorate (rocket fuel) from the body. In the United States, perchlorate frequently contaminates drinking water, milk, and other foods. There are many   health benefits  from increased iodine intake, either from consuming potassium iodide, or from rubbing tincture of   iodine on the skin  so that the body can absorb what it needs through the skin.  Increasing the amount of   glutathione  in your body will help remove heavy metals such as  mercury, lead and cadmium while increasing lifespan by up to 40%. Eating whey powder is a good way to increase your glutathione level. Heavy metals and other toxins stored in the liver and gall bladder as "stones" can be voided via the colon when you do a liver and gall bladder "cleanse" or "flush". You can do a search of the Internet to learn how to do this.   Alpha lipoic acid helps remove  mercury from inside cells and the brain. The mercury is then carried to the liver where it is mixed with bile, and then goes into the intestinal tract. Sulfur-rich foods can bind with mercury in the intestinal tract so that it is not reabsorbed by the body.  Algin is a non-digestible fiber from brown seaweeds such as kelp. Algin will also bind with mercury in the digestive tract, and will also bind with cadmium and radioactive materials. Other intestinal chelators include spirulena, chlorella, aloe, and bentonite clay.  You can purchase or build your own home sauna. By regularly enjoying a prolonged (45 to 90 minute) low temperature (about 108°F / 42°C) sauna, copious quantities of waste are removed from the body in the sweat. The result is a cleaner body and much softer, healthier skin.    Since hyperthermia is the safest, most efficacious and economical way of removing heavy metals and toxic chemicals from the body, we regard some means to accomplish this (sauna / hot tub / bath tub) as a household necessity.            Whirlpool Bath Not Recommended   At first we thought that a whirlpool bath would be better than a hot tub because the water is changed for each user. However, it turns out that there is a problem with whirlpool baths due to water being retained in the piping and jets. This unclean water is a breeding ground for bacteria and fungi. When you fill the bath and turn on the jets, the clean water is immediately contaminated with the bacterial soup from the jets.  A test of 43 whirlpool baths found that all were contaminated. Contaminants included fecal bacteria, Pseudomonas, Legionella, and Staphylococcus. A teaspoon of normal tap water contains 138 bacteria. A teaspoon of whirlpool tub water contained 2.7 million bacteria.   The bacteria identified in whirlpool baths can cause Legionnaire's disease, septicemia (infection of the blood), endocarditis (infection of the surface of the heart), gastroenteritis (infection of the gastrointestinal tract), osteomyelitis (infection of the bones), carbuncles, septic arthritis, toxic shock syndrome, Pontiac fever, pneumonia, scalded skin syndrome, and general infections of the intestines, respiratory tract, eyes and ears.  One hundred and fifty people caught Legionnaire's disease and 16 died after passing by a whirlpool bath on display at a Dutch flower show.  -  PM Engineer 00(Dec).   Editor's note:  Millions of whirlpool bath tubs have been sold. If you have unexplained or recurring skin conditions and other infections, perhaps your whirlpool tub is the cause. If you use a whirlpool bath, you might consider adding a pint or two of 3% hydrogen peroxide to the water each time you use it. We do not know that this will solve the problem. Perhaps someone might test the idea. Certainly, the manufacturers of these tubs have a lot at stake, both in terms of future sales and lawsuits resulting from past sales. If you do not have a whirlpool bath, we recommend you do not buy one.      For more information do a search of the Internet. Look for hyperthermia, fever therapy, sauna, sauna therapy, far infrared sauna, BioToxic Reduction Program (BTR), Zane R. Gard, M.D. (founder of the BTR Program), UltraClear (for hepatic detoxification), EDTA chelation therapy (to remove heavy metals from the body such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and excessive iron & copper), HMD - Heavy Metal Detox, etc. There are also several articles in our   Library  .  Essential oils may assist in detoxifying the body.   Also, Amazon.com carries several books on saunas. Type "sauna" into the Amazon.com search engine on our "  Contents  " page and see what comes up.   Anti-perspirant , as the name clearly indicates, prevents you from perspiring, thereby inhibiting the body from purging toxins from below the armpits. These toxins do not just magically disappear.   If your sweat smells bad, perhaps you should think in terms of helping the body remove the substances from the body by means of techniques to facilitate sweating, rather than trying to prevent sweating.  Also, bacteria feeding on nutrients in sweat produce waste products that cause body odor. Colloidal silver is effective as a deodorant without preventing perspiration. Save money by making your own colloidal silver. Every home should have a colloidal silver machine. They are inexpensive and easy to use. Do an Internet search and you will find many suppliers and even directions to make your own machine. (Three nine volt batteries in series, connected to two silver electrodes suspended in water for about 20 minutes.) Be sure to keep your colloidal silver in a dark glass bottle because it is sensitive to light.  "I've observed for years that people whose diets are rich in high-quality vegetable material have much less body odor." - Dr. Robert Jay Rowen          Coley's Toxins   Coley's toxins produce a fever as high as 104°F. Doctors who do not attempt to reduce the fever with antipyretics have much better results than doctors who reduce the fever. Bacterial toxins contain polysaccharides, as do some   mushrooms  . Polysaccharides can inhibit the growth of tumors in animals. Coley's toxins also contain lipopolysaccharide, renamed tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The modern name for Coley's toxins is Mixed Bacterial Vaccine (MBV). In a German study, advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients receiving MBV had a 93% remission rate, compared to 29% for controls receiving chemotherapy. Coley's Toxins were removed from the American Cancer Society's "unproven methods" list in 1975, but are still not generally available.  - Dr. Ralph W. Moss,  The Cancer Industry , pages 123-124, 160.   ***  If you want to receive treatment with Coley's Toxins see  www.cancerdecisions.com/clinicsofexcellence.html           North American Hyperthermia Society 630-571-2904 www.thermaltherapy.org    European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology (ESHO) http://www.esho.info/        Page Summary   Heat therapy is an ancient and effective technique to promote good health, prevent disease, and treat many conditions. Whether you bury yourself in desert sand, sit in the sun, soak in warm water, or experience a fever during illness, raising body temperature and increasing sweating will purify the body, cleanse the skin, relax the body, improve circulation, stimulate the immune system, and weaken or kill cancer cells. A relatively long (45 - 90 minutes) low temperature (about 108°F / 42°C) heat therapy session is most effective. You can do this weekly to prevent disease and promote health, and daily to help the body recover from disease. Heat therapy is inexpensive and can be enjoyed at home by everyone.   Off to a Fast Start...the Wonders of Meditation   Continuing our non-dietary interventions, we will now discuss the wonders of Transcendental Meditation (TM).
