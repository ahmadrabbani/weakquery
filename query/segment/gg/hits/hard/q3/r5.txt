 Electromagnetic Radiation and cell phone radiation causes alarming health concerns.

                           Electromagnetic Radiation       Anything with an electric current emits electromagnetic radiation (EMR) EMR includes infrared radiation, microwaves, and radio waves. Just as the amount of EMR differs from object to object, the effect it has on people differs from person to person. Cell phones are one of the great sources of alarm for many health issues, and the concern continues to grow as more illnesses are linked to the use of cell phones.   The World Health Organization is instrumental in providing research regarding cell phone radiation and how it affects people who use cell phones. International radiation standards need to be agreed upon and the harmful effects of EMR fully understood before a final decision can be made about the climbing numbers of brain cancer and other ailments being blamed on radio waves. It has been found that radiation shields, such as the Safe Cell Tab by Cell Phone Radiation Protection will help reduce the levels of electromagnetic radiation transmitted from cell phones and other objects.     Sources of EMR   Cell phone towers and other radio towers are some of the most controversial sources of EMR. Environmental physicians include EMR hazards among the sources of environmentally caused illnesses. X-rays are a form of EMR, as is the light from the lamp you read by. We don't worry that we will get cancer from a reading lamp though. EMR in the form of radio waves or microwaves that cook our food are much stronger and are able to cause more serious illnesses.    Most people know that if you spend too much time in the sun you will get burned. Too much exposure to the sun without sunblock can also cause cancer from the ultraviolet rays. These rays that contribute to skin cancer are forms of EMR.
