The Association is expanding into new areas, such as legal services, which are now being offered in six of the country's main cities, and  youth centers which are already established in 14 cities.  Other health and counselling services provided by PROFAMILIA have increased considerably. In recognition of its achievements, PROFAMILIA received the 1988 United Nations Population Award. PROFAMILIA currently represents a health care alternative for Colombians. Through our proactive service diversification programme, PROFAMILIA hopes to restore a large proportion of the international funding which is diminishing as Colombia is no longer seen as a priority country internationally for  family planning aid. PROFAMILIA received funding from UNFPA which allowed us to continue to deliver our rural programme in 67 of the more impoverished municipalities of the Magdalena River Basin, covering 11 of the country's 26 provinces. PROFAMILIA's educational activities are focused on family health, including the recognition and treatment of dehydration and intestinal parasites. The Mobile Health Brigades Project, visiting the slum areas around Bogotá, is focused on two areas:  family planning and information and education activities. The migration of many people from rural areas into the slum areas creates many unmet needs, and puts increasing pressure on the already overstretched services. There are higher levels of illiteracy, fertility and infant mortality in the slum areas.  PROFAMILIA aims to have strategic contact with the leaders of the community and organized groups within it as a basis for community motivation. The information and education facet of the Health Brigade project consists of a series of talks, plus the production and distribution of pamphlets. Each Health Brigade includes a gynaecologist and a nurse, and services are provided at community centres or at peoples homes. Services provided are wider than  family planning alone, the Health Brigades promote massive anti-parasite campaigns, acute respiratory infections and acute diarrheal disease.      © 2011 IPPF 4 Newhams Row, London, SE1 3UZ, Tel: +44 (0)20 7939 8200
