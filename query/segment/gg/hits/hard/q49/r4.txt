Still, any breastfeeding is better than none (except if a woman has HIV). See Preventing Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV, below. Guidelines for Best Breastfeeding   1. Begin breastfeeding the newborn as soon as possible—within 1 hour after delivery    Stimulates uterine contractions that help prevent heavy bleeding. Helps the infant to establish suckling early on, which stimulates milk production.  Colostrum, the yellowish milk produced in the first days after childbirth, provides important nutrients for the child and transfers immunities from mother to child.  Avoids the risks of feeding the baby contaminated liquids or foods.  2. Fully or nearly fully breastfeed for 6 months  Mother’s milk alone can fully nourish a baby for the first 6 months of life.   3. At 6 months, add other foods to breastfeeding  After 6 months babies need a variety of foods in addition to breast milk.  At each feeding breastfeed before giving other foods.  Breastfeeding can and should continue through the child’s second year or longer.   Earliest Time That a Woman Can Start a Family Planning Method After Childbirth      Family Planning Method   Fully or Nearly Fully Breastfeeding  Partially Breastfeeding or Not Breastfeeding   Lactational Amenorrhea  Method  Immediately (Not applicable)  Vasectomy  Immediately or during partner’s pregnancy‡  Male or female condoms  Immediately  Spermicides Immediately  Copper-bearing IUD  Within 48 hours, otherwise wait 4 weeks  Female sterilization  Within 7 days, otherwise wait 6 weeks  Levonorgestrel IUD 4 weeks after childbirth  Diaphragm 6 weeks after childbirth  Fertility awareness methods Start when normal secretions have returned (for symptoms-based methods) or she has had 3 regular menstrual cycles (for calendar-based methods). This will be later for breastfeeding women than for women who are not breastfeeding.  Progestin-only pills 6 weeks after childbirth Immediately if not breastfeeding§ 6 weeks after childbirth if partially breastfeeding§  Progestin-only injectables  Implants  Combined oral contraceptives 6 months after childbirth 21 days after childbirth if not breastfeeding§ 6 weeks after childbirth if partially breastfeeding  Monthly injectables  Combined patch  Combined vaginal ring    ‡ If a man has a vasectomy during the first 6 months of his partner’s pregnancy, it will be effective by the time she delivers her baby. § Earlier use is not usually recommended unless other, more appropriate methods are not available or not acceptable. Preventing Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV  A woman infected with HIV can pass HIV to her child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Antiretroviral preventive measures (prophylaxis) given to the mother during pregnancy and labor can reduce the chances that the baby will be infected while developing in the uterus or during delivery. Antiretroviral therapy for the mother, if she needs it for her own health, may help reduce the chances of HIV transmission through breast milk. How can family planning providers help prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV?  Help women avoid HIV infection (see  Sexually Transmitted Infections , Including HIV, Preventing Sexually Transmitted Infections). Prevent unintended pregnancies: Help women who do not want a child to choose a contraceptive method that they can use effectively. Offer HIV counseling and testing: Offer counseling and testing to all pregnant women, if possible, or offer to refer them to an HIV testing service, so they can learn their HIV status. Refer: Refer women with HIV who are pregnant, or who want to become pregnant, to services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission, if available. Encourage appropriate infant feeding: Counsel women with HIV on safer infant feeding practices to reduce the risk of transmission, and help them develop a feeding plan. If possible, refer them to someone trained to counsel on infant feeding. – A woman with HIV should be counseled to choose the feeding option that best suits her situation. If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, she should avoid breastfeeding. – If replacement feeding does not meet these conditions, a woman with HIV should breastfeed exclusively for the first 6 months. Mixed feeding—that is, giving the baby both breast milk and other liquids or foods—is riskier than exclusive breastfeeding. – To further reduce the risk of transmission, when mothers with HIV switch to replacement foods, they should avoid a prolonged period of mixed feeding. Stopping breastfeeding over a period of about 2 days to 3 weeks poses the least risk of HIV transmission. – To destroy HIV in breast milk, express and heat-treat milk before feeding it to the infant: Heat milk to the boiling point in a small pot, and then cool the milk by letting it stand or by placing the pot in a container of cool water, which cools the milk more quickly. – Women with HIV who are breastfeeding need advice on keeping their nutrition adequate and their breasts healthy. Infection of the milk ducts in the breast (mastitis), a pocket of pus under the skin  (breast abscess), and cracked nipples increase the risk of HIV transmission. If a problem does occur, prompt and appropriate care is important (see Sore or cracked nipples, below). Managing Any Breastfeeding Problems   If a client reports any of these common problems, listen to her concerns and give advice.  Baby is not getting enough milk  Reassure the woman that most women can produce enough breast milk to feed their babies.  If the newborn is gaining more than 500 grams a month, weighs more than birth weight at 2 weeks, or urinates at least 6 times a day, reassure her that her baby is getting enough breast milk.  Tell her to breastfeed her newborn about every 2 hours to increase milk supply.  Recommend that she reduce any supplemental foods and/or liquids if the baby is less than 6 months of age.   Sore breasts  If her breasts are full, tight, and painful, then she may have engorged breasts. If one breast has tender lumps, then she may have blocked ducts. Engorged breasts or blocked ducts may progress to red and tender infected breasts. Treat infected breasts with antibiotics according to clinic guidelines. To aid healing, advise her to: – Continue to breastfeed often – Massage her breasts before and during breastfeeding – Apply heat or a warm compress to breasts – Try different breastfeeding positions – Ensure that the infant attaches properly to the breast – Express some milk before breastfeeding Sore or cracked nipples  If her nipples are cracked, she can continue breastfeeding. Assure her that they will heal over time. To aid healing, advise her to: – Apply drops of breast milk to the nipples after breastfeeding and allow to air-dry. – After feeding, use a finger to break suction first before removing the baby from the breast. – Do not wait until the breast is full to breastfeed. If full, express some milk first. Teach her about proper attachment and how to check for signs that the baby is not attaching properly. Tell her to clean her nipples with only water only once a day and to avoid soaps and alcohol-based solutions. Examine her nipples and the baby’s mouth and buttocks for signs of fungal infection (thrush).
