One study, showing a slight decline in the number of teenagers having sex, seems to indicate that the message is beginning to sink in to young people that they will pay a high price for experimenting with sex before marriage, the most important of which is there is no free lunch. New welfare reforms require them to work to support the child they bring into the world. The National Survey of Family Growth, an in-depth government report conducted every five years, found 50 percent of teenage girls ages 15 to 19 had intercourse at least once, down from 55 percent in 1990. The decline can be attributed, in part, to abstinence-based sex education programs and measures that put an end to welfare careers. Tough new federal and state welfare reforms enacted in 1996 require that teenage parents live at home or under the supervision of responsible adults and stay in school in order to get benefits. Teenage mothers also are required to help state officials find the father of the child in order to get benefits. While welfare reforms provide limited exemptions for work requirements for minor children, the message to teenage parents is they will be required by law to take financial responsibility eventually for themselves and their children. What is certain to have an even more sobering effect on the young people are the recent highly publicized tragic stories involving teenage parents who face charges of murder because of the deaths of their newborn babies. Finally, the political leadership of the United States, which has a higher teenage pregnancy rate than any other industrialized nation, is recognizing that programs that coddle young parents often are a waste of money. The National Campaign to Prevent Teenage Pregnancy, which has a goal of reducing the teenage pregnancy rate by one-third over the next decade, rejects conventional wisdom that sex education and access to birth control will prevent pregnancy. Campaign organizers admit they really don't know what works. However, their immediate focus is to work with TV media, schools, churches and businesses in helping to convey to teenagers the pitfalls of early parenthood. One of the best tools the new pregnancy prevention campaign could use is a new study by the New Yorkbased Manpower Research and Demonstration Corp. This study paints a pessimistic economic picture even for mothers enrolled in a program described as the most elaborate and comprehensive to date to help disadvantaged teenage mothers. The study of 2,079 teenage in New Chance programs in 12 cities, including Jacksonville, shows the young mothers were no more likely to find a job, leave welfare roles or avoid pregnancy than teenage moms who had no assistance. The report provides support for those advocating further cuts in other programs that merely prolong the time before young people take responsibility for themselves. ''This will be another nail in the coffin of the nurturing, supportive approach to welfare recipients,'' said Douglas Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute. Education about the pitfalls of teenage pregancy is needed in Jacksonville, where the already high teenage pregnancy birthrate rose slightly over the last two years, despite efforts to lower it through abstinence-based sex education programs such as New Chance. In 1996, 1,702 girls ages 15 to 19 gave birth last year compared to 1,666 for the same group last year. Neighboring counties across the Georgia border, unfortunately, have some of the worst teenage pregnancy rates in the nation. After all the experiments and wasted taxpayer money, tough love appears to be the logical approach to discouraging youngsters from pre-marital sex. Search - Use + to require word, - to omit.
