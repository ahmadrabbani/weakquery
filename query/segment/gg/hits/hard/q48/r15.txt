Believe it or not, in this day and age a teenager can get pregnant, continue high school (public), and go to college. As a high school teacher, I see pregnant girls every year. 2 years ago, I overheard a girl ask another senior (who had a one year old son) if she was going to college. She replied, "Of course I am. I get to go for free" (because she is a teenage mom). I won't get into my personal feelings on that issue, but my point is that she doesn't have to quit school. Someone should ask her what she wants--this is, after all, her body, her life, and her decision.     agreed. Just because you are a pregnant teen doesnt mean you cant finish school. It epecially doesnt mean that you cant further your education after high school as well. there are many options. She could get her diploma or go to night school where she would also get a diploma. When it comes to college there are so many options plus daycare at most colleges. In fact there are highschools that have day cares in them as well.                           05-17-2009, 12:25 PM      cpg35223   Senior Member          Status:  "November and I'm already sick of winter."
