More:  Teenage Problems  Teenage Health  Celebrity Pregnancy  Prevent Pregnancy        Flag  Close      Post a comment            The disclosure of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin's teenage daughter's pregnancy came as a shock to some, an opportunity for attack for others, a chance for empathy with a few, and as a clarification for still others (those who thought the 4-month-old child, Trig, was actually Palin's grandchild). Although the official statement by the family is one of love and support, one would have to imagine that this would be a trying time for the teenager, Bristol, and her family. And the lack of privacy that will be afforded the family due to its newfound national celebrity will only add to the stresses and burdens already acquired.  It is difficult enough to be a teenage unwed mother without the added burdens of social and media scrutiny. Yet, this is exactly what  Bristol Palin will endure because of her mother's nomination to the vice presidency slot on the Republican ticket. Being a teenage unwed mother in American society is still frowned upon, spoken out against, preached against, and is the target of abstinence and planned  parenting groups and organizations throughout the country.  No, being a teenage unwed mother is not an easy burden to bear no matter if you're Joe Smith's daughter in Anywhere, USA, or if you happen to be the daughter of the prospective  vice president of the United States. The biggest difference, of course, would be the level of media exposure. The fact would still remain that they are young women about to have children.

Bastian 9/11/2008  Well, it doesn't need to be a campaign issue, true. But, it will be a hard one to avoid. If you have a candidate advocating abstinence over pregnancy prevention, well, it's hard not to look over their shoulder at the pregnant teenager. Having said that, life is going to be hard enough, and the media shouldn't be looking for reasons to use it, either.    saul relative 9/4/2008  Thanks, Cindi. Although I do believe this is a newsworthy topic, I have my reservations about this being used as a political weapon. But the abstinence and family planning issues are going to come up and be used to slam Palin. It's rather unfortunate...    saul relative 9/3/2008  It shouldn't be and it really isn't, Jill. But many people are judgmental and many will judge Sarah Palin as wanting as a mother. Character goes a long way in how people choose their candidates. They may not vote for her because of this. They may not vote for Obama, neither, but if they stay at home, it shifts the vote.    saul relative 9/3/2008  Right you are, Adrienne. But in Alaska, the media exposure would be nothing as it is as a vice presidential candidate. Of course, it still may have made national news. But it would have come and gone. Now, it's here for awhile...    J. E. Davidson 9/3/2008  It seems that whenever I run into a group of teen girls in public, at least one is pushing a baby stroller. It's unfortunate that this is such a problem, but we adults need to realize that we are part of the problem, allowing our children to be exposed to so much gratuitous sex in the entertainment media. Kids are losing their innocence too early, and growing up too fast! They take foolish chances, which is their nature. Bristol isn't going through anything many teens girls aren't experiencing, but she's doing it in the limelight. While I have no particular opinion of her mother (yet) I don't think this needs to be a campaign issue.    Adrienne Jenkins 9/3/2008  Your empathy hits the issue squarely. It is hard enough for any teenage mother let alone the daughter of a prominent politician. It is disappointing that Sarah Palin did not have the sensitivity to reject the nomination so her daughter could weather through this issue. I realize that as Governor of Alaska, the issue would have come to light but it is with even more political glare that must be devastating.    saul relative 9/2/2008  There is a lot of crap out there concerning this issue, Charlotte. Although I disagree with her as a choice for vice president and some of her political stances, her daughter is still just a young woman. She is going to be sorely used by the media and politicians (on every side) and for that we can probably blame Palin's ambition and the callousness of politics. It is sad. It shouldn't be this way, but it is...    Charlotte Kuchinsky 9/2/2008  Teenage pregnancy has been a part of life as far back as time itself. It is sad to be certain, especially in a day when there is so much available to avoid it. Thanks for your perspective, Saul.
