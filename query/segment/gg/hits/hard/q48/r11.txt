Causes, incidence, and risk factors: The rate of adolescent pregnancy and the birth rate for adolescents have generally declined since reaching an all-time high in 1990, mostly due to the increased use of  condoms . Adolescent pregnancy is a complex issue with many reasons for concern. Younger adolescents (12 - 14 years old) are more likely to have unplanned sexual intercourse and more likely to be coerced into sex. Adolescents 18 - 19 years old are technically adults, and half of adolescent pregnancies occur in this age group. Risk factors for adolescent pregnancy include: Younger age Poor school performance Economic disadvantage Single or teen parents      Ultrasound in pregnancy     Adolescent pregnancy     Ultrasound, normal fetus - abdomen measurements     Ultrasound, normal fetus - arm and legs     Ultrasound, normal placenta - Braxton Hicks     Ultrasound, normal fetus - face     Ultrasound, normal fetus - femur measurement     Ultrasound, normal fetus - foot     Ultrasound, normal fetus - head measurements     Ultrasound, normal fetus - heartbeat     Ultrasound, normal fetus - heartbeat     Ultrasound, normal fetus - arms and legs     Ultrasound, normal relaxed placenta     Ultrasound, normal fetus - profile view     Ultrasound, normal fetus - spine and ribs     Ultrasound, color - normal umbilical cord     Ultrasound, normal fetus - ventricles of brain    Reviewed last on: 9/2/2009 Linda J.
