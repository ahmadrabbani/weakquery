                             The              THE KARI AND LUCAS MYSTERIES:   THE MYSTERY OF THE THIRD LUCRETIA    CHAPTER 1          Beginnings       My name is Kari Sundgren. This story is about how my best friend Lucas and I solved a big, international art crime, and all the adventures we had doing it.  Lucas is Lucas Stickney. She's a girl. My ninth grade English book says when you're telling a complicated story, unless you're a real expert, it's usually best to begin at the beginning and go all the way to the end. That makes sense. But since I read that, I've noticed that finding the beginning of a story, especially when your story is a complicated one, isn't always as easy as it sounds. Some stories don't seem to have a beginning. They just sort of happen because of a lot of things that have been going on for a long time. And some stories have too many beginnings. You could start almost anywhere. ( Read More ) Click here to        order       THE MYSTERY OF THE THIRD LUCRETIA      and all the Kari and Lucas Books from  my Amazon.com Author Page!     RESCUING SENECA CRANE  CHAPTER 1   Prelude    The first time I saw Seneca Crane she came onstage at a Minnesota Orchestra concert, sat down at the piano, and played a Mozart concerto. She got a standing ovation. She was thirteen then, just a year older than I was. She was wearing a short, shimmery silver dress, and her hair was in cornrows and long braids. I was sitting near the front with my mom and my best friend, Lucas (who's a girl), so we could see Seneca up close. She was pretty, with smooth skin a little darker than coffee ice cream, a cute little pointed chin, a small nose, and a long, graceful neck. But when she came out and made that little bow musicians make before they play, what I mostly noticed were her eyes. They were big and dark and sparkly, the kind of eyes that show everything the person behind them is feeling. And just then, even though she was smiling, her eyes looked terrified.

ADVENTURE AT SIMBA HILL CHAPTER 1   Camellia, Lucas, and the Personal Cooling System   ONE WORD and i hack u 2 pieces and throw u 2 the hyenas.  One word about what? I stared at my phone. The text was from my best friend, Lucas Stickney. We’re both girls. I texted back,  wtm ? That stood for what the meep? Meep is what Lucas and I substitute for the kind of words fourteen year olds like us aren’t allowed to say in front of adults, and using it has kind of gotten to be a habit. The text came back.  STARVING hyenas . I still had no clue. It was a snowy Sunday afternoon in December. Mom was on the other end of the couch leafing through a magazine as we watched old  30 Rock episodes from Netflix. She must have seen my expression out of the corner of her eye, because she looked up from the page and said, “What’s going on?” I did a palms up, but before I could tell her, I heard people coming up the stairs to our duplex. The next second there was a knock. The minute I opened the door I understood.  ( Read More ) Click here to        order   ADVENTURE AT SIMBA HILL      and all the Kari and Lucas Books from  my Amazon.com Author Page!                         Home  Books  Art & Travel  Contact  The Press  Educator     The Blog
