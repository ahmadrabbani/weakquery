From October 15 to 26, 2007, the Truthfulness-Compassion-Tolerance International Art Exhibition was held at the Library and Information Building of Chiayi University. The exhibition, bringing its fresh artistic quality to the campus, attracted many students and teachers. By visiting the exhibition, the students and teachers learned about the unique beauty of Falun Dafa and the brutal persecution of Falun Gong in China. Many people expressed their support for Falun Gong and justice, and their hope for a quick end to the evil persecution in China.       Students visiting the art exhibition         An exhibition guide introduces the meaning and background story of the paintings  President of the university Mr. Li Mingren visited the exhibition on October 22. During the tour, he told the guide that it was a great exhibition and said he would encourage all students to visit. When he was leaving, he praised the exhibition loudly, "This is great! The exhibition is very good, very successful!" The Truthfulness-Compassion-Tolerance International Art Exhibition has been displayed in over 30 countries. Recently, it was displayed in the nearby cities of Tainan, Puzi of Chiayi County and Minhsiung County, where it received a warm welcome and praise from local government officials and residents. The exhibition in Chiayi University was organized by the Falun Dafa club. The local practitioners of Chiayi County replaced all 46 paintings with new frames before the exhibition. Falun Dafa practitioner artists use their artwork to expose the brutal persecution of Falun Gong happening in China and to display the uncompromising courage and noble character of the Falun Dafa cultivators who practice "Truthfulness-Compassion-Tolerance." The artists hope that more people, by viewing the art, can learn about the facts of Falun Gong and pay attention to and help end the persecution as soon as possible.    University President Li Mingren praises the exhibition The president of Chiayi University Mr. Li Mingren, during an interview with New Tang Dynasty TV, said, "Falun Gong is a kind of cultivation, very peaceful and tolerant. It is a belief that brings health to the body, better character, and benefits to others. It is benevolent, positive and beneficial. I saw a lot of paintings depicting torture. I felt sad and sympathetic on seeing them. A belief in truthfulness-compassion-tolerance should be encouraged. All people should have the freedom to hold this belief. Let the world be full of harmony and peace - why persecute them? I am upset that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) makes the practitioners' whole family suffer. Besides sympathy, we shall speak up openly. Falun Gong is good and beneficial to people. This exhibition is very good, very successful!" A female student majoring in Agriculture said after visiting the exhibition, "The paintings are fine and pretty. I feel pity for those being persecuted simply because they practice Falun Gong." A male student said, "People ought to have freedom of belief. The communist party's tortures are very cruel and bloody. We must stop the persecution." Facing the paintings, another female student said, "I am so impressed..." A Falun Gong practitioner at the exhibition said, "The artists practice Falun Dafa and live their lives according to the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Tolerance to become better people. Their improved characters show up in their artworks. Many students visited this exhibition and learned of the beauty and righteousness of Falun Dafa, as well as the truth of the persecution of Falun Gong in China. We hope they will spread the word to their friends."
