There are two types of UV rays: UV-A and UV-B. UV-A UV-A can hurt your central vision. It can damage the macula, a part of the retina at the back of your eye. UV-B The front part of your eye (the cornea and the lens) absorbs most UV-B rays, but these rays may cause even more damage to your eyes than UV-A rays. What eye problems can UV rays cause? Over time, the effects of UV rays may help cause a number of eye problems. Macular Degeneration  UV rays may lead to  macular degeneration , a leading cause of vision loss for older Americans. Cataract  UV rays, especially UV-B rays, may also cause some kinds of  cataracts . A cataract is a clouding of the eye’s natural lens, the part of the eye that focuses the light we see. Pterygium  Another UV-related problem is a growth called  pterygium . This growth begins on the white of the eye and may involve the  cornea . Eventually, the growth may block vision. It is more common in people who work outside in the sun and wind. Skin Cancer  Skin cancer around the eyelids is also linked to prolonged UV exposure. Corneal Sunburn  Corneal sunburn , called photokeratitis, is the result of high short-term exposure to UV-B rays. Long hours at the beach or skiing without proper eye protection can cause this problem. It can be very painful and may cause temporary vision loss.  How Can I Protect My Eyes from UV Rays?
