        <p><font size="2">Copyright 1993 National Alliance for the Mentally Ill 
          </font><br>
          By Agnes B. Hatfield, Ph.D. <br>
        <hr>
        Families who have mentally ill relatives whose problems are compounded 
        by substance abuse face problems of enormous proportions. Mental health 
        services are not well prepared to deal with patients having both afflictions. 
        Often only one of the two problems is identified. If both are recognized, 
        the individual may be bounced back and forth between services for mental 
        illness and those for substance abuse, or they may be refused treatment 
        by each of them. <br>
        <br>
        While the picture regarding dual diagnosis has not been very positive 
        at this point, there are now signs that the problem is being recognized 
        and there is an increasing number of programs trying to address the treatment 
        needs of people with both problems. Research studies are beginning to 
        help us understand the scope of the problem. It is now generally agreed 
        that as much as 50 percent of the mentally ill population also has a substance 
        abuse problem. The drug most commonly used is alcohol, followed by marijuana 
        and cocaine. Prescription drugs such as tranquilizers and sleeping medicines 
        may also be abused.<br>
        <br>
        The incidence of abuse is greater among males and those in the age bracket 
        of 18 to 44. People with mental illnesses may abuse drugs covertly without 
        their families knowing it. It is now reported that both families of mentally 
        ill relatives and mental health professionals underestimate the amount 
        of drug dependency among people in their care. There may be several reasons 
        for this. It may be difficult to separate the behaviors due to mental 
        illness from those due to drugs. There may be a degree of denial of the 
        problem because we have had so little to offer people with the combined 
        illnesses. Caregivers might prefer not to acknowledge such a frightening 
        problem when so little hope has been offered. <br>
        <br>
        Substance abuse complicates almost every aspect of care for the person 
        with mental illness. First of all, of course, these individuals are very 
        difficult to engage in treatment. Diagnosis is difficult because it takes 
        time to unravel the interacting effects of substance abuse and the mental 
        illness. They may have difficulty being accommodated at home and may not 
        be tolerated in community residences of rehabilitation programs. They 
        lose their support systems and suffer frequent relapses and hospitalizations. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Violence is more prevalent among the dually diagnosed population. Both 
        domestic violence and suicide attempts are more common, and of the mentally 
        ill who wind up in jails and prisons, there is a high percentage of drug 
        abusers. Given severe consequences of drug abuse for the mentally ill, 
        it is reasonable to ask: &quot;Why do they do it?&quot; Some of them may 
        begin to use drugs or alcohol for recreational use, the same as many other 
        people do. Various factors may account for their continued use. Probably 
        many people continue their use as a misguided attempt to treat symptoms 
        of the illness or the side effects of their medications. They find that 
        they can reduce the level of anxiety or depression -- at least for the 
        short term. Some professionals speculate that there may be some underlying 
        vulnerability of the individual that precipitates both mental illness 
        and substance abuse. They believe that these individuals may be at risk 
        with even mild drug use. <br>
        <br>
        Social factors may also play a part in continued use. People with mental 
        illnesses suffer from what has been called &quot;downward drift.&quot; 
        This means that as a consequence of their illness they may find themselves 
        living in marginal neighborhoods where drug use prevails. Having great 
        difficulty developing social relationships, some people find themselves 
        more easily accepted by groups whose social activity is based on drug 
        use. Some may believe that an identity based on drug addiction is more 
        acceptable than one based on mental illness. <br>
        <br>
        We realize that this overview of the problem of drugs and mental illness 
        is not a very positive one. However, we believe there are some encouraging 
        signs that better understanding of the problem and potential treatments 
        are on the way. Just as families have faced other very troublesome problems 
        in the past and developed adequate responses to them, we believe that 
        they can learn to deal with this one in a way that their lives become 
        less troubled and their relatives begin receiving better treatment. <br>
        <p></p>
      </dl>
      <h4>Treatment Programs For The Dually Diagnosed </h4>
      <dl> 
        <p>As many families have probably discovered, service systems have not 
          been well designed with this population in mind. Typically a community 
          has treatment services for people with mental illness in one agency 
          and treatment for substance abuse in another. Clients are referred back 
          and forth between them in what some have called &quot;ping-pong&quot; 
          therapy. What is needed are &quot;hybrid&quot; programs that address 
          both illnesses together. Development of these programs locally requires 
          considerable advocacy efforts. </p>
      </dl>
      <h4>Limitations Of Traditional Drug Treatment Programs </h4>
      <dl> 
        <p>Treatment programs designed for people whose problems are primarily 
          substance abuse are generally not recommended for people who also have 
          a mental illness. These programs tend to be confrontive and coercive 
          and most people with severe mental illnesses are too fragile to benefit 
          from them. Heavy confrontation, intense emotional jolting, and discouragement 
          of the use of medications tend to be detrimental. These treatments may 
          produce levels of stress that exacerbate symptoms or cause relapse. 
        </p>
      </dl>
      <h4>Characteristics Of Appropriate Programs </h4>
      <dl> 
        <p>Desirable programs for this population should take a more gradual approach. 
          Staff should recognize that denial is an inherent part of the problem. 
          Patients often do not have insight as to the seriousness and scope of 
          the problem. Abstinence may be a goal of the program but should not 
          be a precondition for entering treatment. If dually diagnosed clients 
          do not fit into local Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous 
          (NA) groups, special peer groups based on AA principles might be developed. 
          Clients with dual diagnosis have to proceed at their own pace in treatment. 
          An illness model of the problem should be used rather than a moralistic 
          one. Staff needs to convey understanding of how hard it is to end an 
          addiction problem and give credit for any accomplishments. Attention 
          should be given to social networks that can serve as important reinforcers. 
          Clients should be given opportunities to socialize, have access to recreational 
          activities, and develop peer relationships. Their families should be 
          offered support and education. </p>
      </dl>
      <h4>Advocacy For Effective Treatment </h4>
      <dl> 
        <p>If no appropriate programs exist in the community, families of dually 
          diagnosed persons may need to advocate for them. References at the end 
          of the paper describe a number of experimental programs that can serve 
          as sources of information. Advocacy should also be directed at research 
          and training. An example of a recommended program is one conceptualized 
          by Sciacca (1987). It uses an educational approach and recognizes the 
          tendency for dually diagnosed individuals to deny their problem. The 
          patient does not have to recognize or publicly acknowledge that he or 
          she has a problem. Patients meet in a group and talk about the issue 
          of substance abuse, view videotapes and involve themselves in helping 
          others. Only later do members get around to talking about their problem 
          and the potential for treatment. A nonconfrontational style is maintained 
          throughout. Rather than send participants to AA or NA, members of these 
          groups are invited to visit the agency. Eventually some of Sciacca's 
          groups do go to AA and NA. </p>
      </dl>
      <h4>Family Management And Coping</h4>
      <dl> 
        <p>It is difficult enough to cope with problems presented by a relative's 
          mental illness, but when substance abuse is also a problem, family stress 
          can be multiplied. These families need all the help they can get to 
          help them cope with the additional burdens they face. </p>
      </dl>
      <h4>Recognizing The Problem</h4>
      <dl> 
        <p>It was stated earlier than many families do not recognize that their 
          mentally ill member also has a substance abuse problem. This is not 
          surprising because many of the behavioral changes that lead to suspicion 
          of drug problems in other people, already exist in persons with mental 
          illness. Therefore, such behaviors as rebelliousness and argumentiveness 
          or being &quot;spacey&quot; may be less reliable clues in this group. 
          Observation of some of the following behaviors, however, may put families 
          on the alert: -- Suddenly having money problems -- Appearance of new 
          friends -- Valuables disappearing from the house -- Drug paraphernalia 
          in the house -- Long periods of time in the bathroom -- Dilated or pinpointed 
          eyes -- Needle marks Of course, there are also those individuals who 
          react strongly to drugs and alcohol and whose unusually chaotic behaviors 
          leave little doubt regarding the use of drugs. </p>
      </dl>
      <h4>Confronting The Problem</h4>
      <dl> 
        <p>Confronting the problem may or may not involve confronting the individual. 
          It is usually best not to immediately and directly accuse the individual 
          of using drugs because denial is a likely response. Unless one has irrefutable 
          evidence, the person is entitled to be presumed innocent. What one can 
          object to are behaviors, whether or not they are known to be influenced 
          by drugs, which are interfering with family life. These behaviors may 
          take any number of forms: apathy, irritability, neglect of personal 
          hygiene, belligerence, argumentiveness, and so forth. Since the problem 
          of drug use is a very serious and complicated matter, it should be addressed 
          in a careful deliberate manner. It is best not to try to deal with the 
          individual when he or she appears to be under the influence of drugs 
          or alcohol, nor when family members are feeling most emotionally upset 
          about the situation. Avoid making dire threats such as calling the police, 
          resorting to hospitalization, or exclusion from the home unless you 
          really mean to do it. There is a risk that you may say things under 
          the stress of the situation that you don't mean. It is important that 
          your relative knows where he or she stands with you and that you mean 
          what you say. </p>
      </dl>
      <h4>Develop A Plan Of Action </h4>
      <dl> 
        <p>Since it is likely to be difficult at best, select a time when things 
          are relatively calm to decide what to do. Involve as many members of 
          the family as possible and develop an approach all can agree upon. The 
          following set of guidelines may help you come up with a plan: </p>
        <p>1. Be sure that all members agree on what the problem is. What exactly 
          have members observed that has to be dealt with? Is it some unacceptable 
          behavior that might be caused by drugs or is there clear evidence of 
          drugs? What is the evidence? </p>
        <p>2. Generate a number of possible solutions to the problem with the 
          goal of acting on the one(s) that all agree are the best one(s). Of 
          course, families will differ a great deal in what they think is possible 
          in their situation. What follows is a hypothetical family who might 
          come up with some of the following suggestions: -- Relate your concerns 
          to your relative's psychiatrist or therapist. -- Confront him or her 
          with your observations and request very specific changes in behavior. 
          -- Plan ways to reduce access to money that might be going for drugs. 
          -- Do anything possible to reduce his or her needs for or interest in 
          social groups that use drugs. -- Confront the person with clear evidence 
          that he or she is using drugs and suggest treatment. </p>
        <p>3. Come to an agreement about what may be the best approach to try 
          first. </p>
        <p>4. Develop very specific steps to carrying out your plans. Decide what 
          role each member will have in implementing the plan. If there is a decision 
          to confront the person directly about drug use, be prepared to give 
          the evidence. State calmly that you believe drug use is occurring, provide 
          the evidence, and what you want the person to do about it. Refuse to 
          get in an argument with the person. </p>
        <p>Have a definite plan in mind, including a contact with an available 
          treatment center, telephone numbers, etc., so you can proceed immediately 
          if he or she should agree to treatment. It is important to avoid a moralistic 
          tone about drug use. It is better to focus on the consequences that 
          you have observed for the person and for his or her family. If the family 
          decides that the problem is serious and the individual is likely to 
          be lax about compliance with the family's reasonable requests, then 
          negative consequences may be considered for failure to comply. This 
          must be weighed very carefully. It is not easy to think of negative 
          consequences for adults that one can enforce and, as we have said before, 
          it is never wise to make threats that you don't intend to carry out. 
        </p>
        <p>For the usual misbehaviors, the person should be asked to make amends 
          or the person may lose a privilege he or she enjoys. When problems get 
          so severe that other members are at risk, the person may be forewarned 
          that he or she will be asked to leave. Then the family must follow through. 
          This works better if alternate housing can be arranged ahead of time 
          so that the streets do not become the only option. Families often ask 
          if the family should insist on total abstinence from all drug use. While 
          authorities in the field point out that abstinence is by far the safest 
          option, some families may find that tolerance of occasional use or agreement 
          to cut back may get reasonable cooperation whereas insistence on total 
          abstinence will result in denial and inability to communicate further 
          on the subject. Recreational drugs and alcohol and prescribed medications 
          might have serious interactive effects. Clients and families need to 
          be fully informed about these possibilities. </p>

      <h4>Support And Self-Care For The Rest Of The Family </h4>
      <dl> 
        <p>Coming to terms with chemical dependency of a mentally ill relative 
          does not come easily. For a time, it just feels too painful, too bewildering, 
          too overwhelming to face. The family may feel terribly angry at the 
          person and blame him or her for seeming so stupid, so weak willed as 
          to add problems of substance abuse to an already highly disturbed life. 
        </p>
        <p>Feeling angry and rejecting unfortunately does not help the situation 
          and delays rational thinking about how to approach the situation. Parents 
          and siblings may be hurt because the addicted person blames others for 
          his or her problems and breaks trust by lying and stealing, and in general, 
          creates chaos throughout the household. A great deal of fear and uncertainty 
          may prevail as behavior becomes more irrational and violence or threats 
          of violence increases. </p>
        <p>Members of the family may feel guilty because they feel their relative's 
          substance abuse is in some way their fault. It is important, first of 
          all, to realize that substance abuse is a disease. The person who is 
          truly addicted is no more able to take control of this problem without 
          help than he or she is able to take control of his mental illness. Thinking 
          of this problem as a disease may reduce the sense of anger and blame. 
          Family members may learn to take negative behaviors less personally 
          and feel less hurt. People may cease blaming themselves and each other 
          for a disorder that no one could have caused or prevented. </p>
        <p>Coming to terms with substance abuse in someone you love will take 
          time. It will be easier if the family can close ranks, avoid blaming 
          each other, agree on a plan of action, and provide support to each other. 
          It is also important to seek support from other families who are dealing 
          with dually diagnosed relatives. This subset of families in the local 
          Alliance of the Mentally Ill may find it beneficial to meet separately 
          at times to provide support in a way best done by other people who also 
          have the problem. </p>
        <p>Families may want to investigate their local Alcoholic Anonymous (Al-Non) 
          and/or Narcotics Anonymous (NA) groups. These support groups have proven 
          to be immensely helpful to some families. Finally, it is important to 
          say that families cannot stop their relative's substance abuse. They 
          can, however, avoid covering it up or doing things that make it easy 
          for the person to continue the denial. Families can learn what they 
          can do about the problem, but they must be realistic that much of it 
          is out of their hands. With great efforts some of the painful emotions 
          will subside, members will feel more serene, and life can be worthwhile 
          again. </p>
        <p>Twelve Things To Do If Your Loved One Is Addicted To Drugs And/Or Alcohol 
        </p>
        <p>1. Don't regard this as a family disgrace. Recovery from an addiction 
          can come about just as with other illnesses. </p>
        <p>2. Don't nag, preach or lecture to the addict/alcoholic. Chances are 
          he/she has already told him or herself everything you can tell them. 
          He/she will take just so much and shut out the rest. You may only increase 
          their need to lie or force one to make promises that cannot possibly 
          be kept. </p>
        <p>3. Guard against the &quot;holier-than-thou&quot; or martyr-like attitude. 
          It is possible to create this impression without saying a word. An addict's 
          sensitivity is such that he/she judges other people's attitudes toward 
          him/her more by small things than spoken words. </p>
        <p>4. Don't use the &quot;if you loved me&quot; appeal. Since the addict/alcoholic 
          is compulsive and cannot be controlled by willpower, this approach only 
          increases guilt. It is like saying, &quot;If you loved me, you would 
          not have tuberculosis.&quot; </p>
        <p>5. Avoid any threats unless you think it through carefully and definitely 
          intend to carry them out. There may be times, of course, when a specific 
          action is necessary to protect children. Idle threats only make the 
          addict/alcoholic feel you don't mean what you say. </p>
        <p>6. Don't hide the drugs/alcohol or dispose of them/it. Usually this 
          only pushes the addict/alcoholic into a state of desperation. In the 
          end he/she will simply find news ways of getting more drugs/liquor. 
        </p>
        <p>7. Don't let the addict/alcoholic persuade you to use drugs or drink 
          with him/her on the grounds that it will make him/her use less. It rarely 
          does. Besides, when you condone the using/drinking, he/she puts off 
          doing something to get help. </p>
        <p>8. Don't be jealous of the method of recovery the addict/alcoholic 
          chooses. The tendency is to think that love of home and family is enough 
          incentive for seeking recovery. Frequently the motivation of regaining 
          self respect is more compelling for the addict/alcoholic than resumption 
          of family responsibilities. You may feel left out when the addict/alcoholic 
          turns to other people for helping stay sober. You wouldn't be jealous 
          of the doctor of someone needing medical care, would you? </p>
        <p>9. Don't expect an immediate 100 percent recovery. In any illness, 
          there is a period of convalescence. There may be relapses and times 
          of tension and resentment. </p>
        <p>10. Don't try to protect the recovering person from using/drinking 
          situations. It's one of the quickest ways to push one into relapse. 
          They must learn on their own to say &quot;no&quot; gracefully. If you 
          warn people against serving him/her drinks, you will stir up old feelings 
          of resentment and inadequacy. </p>
        <p>11. Don't do for the addict/alcoholic that which he/she can do for 
          him/herself. You cannot take the medicine for him/her. Don't remove 
          the problem before the addict/alcoholic can face it, solve it or suffer 
          the consequences. </p>
        <p>12. Do offer love, support and understanding in the recovery. </p>
