  <h1><a name="content" id="content"></a>Tobacco FAQs and Answers</h1>
        <p><a name="TOPICS" id="TOPICS"></a><strong>Revised: </strong>07/25/07</p>
        <h2>General  Tobacco</h2>
        <p><a name="t1" id="t1"></a><strong>T1: What do I need to know about ordering tobacco  products, such as cigarettes, through the Internet?&nbsp; Can I receive these products &ldquo;tax free&rdquo; or  &ldquo;duty free&rdquo;?</strong></p>
        <p>There is currently no  Federal law that prohibits Internet tobacco product sales. 
          However, there is also no  exemption from Federal laws for tobacco products ordered over the  Internet.&nbsp; Therefore, consumers who order  tobacco products to be shipped to them from outside the United States are  not exempt from payment of Federal excise tax and customs duties due on these  products when imported.</p>
        <p>In addition, consumers who  use the Internet to buy cigarettes from vendors outside their State may be  liable for their State&rsquo;s cigarette excise and/or sales taxes, and a State may have  prohibitions or restrictions on Internet or mail-order purchases of tobacco  products, or may have special requirements for such purchases. &nbsp;For information about State requirements,  contact the agency in your State with authority for tax administration.&nbsp; Under Federal law, cigarette vendors who sell  and ship cigarettes into another State to anyone other than a licensed  distributor must report to the State (1) the name and address of the person(s)  to whom cigarettes shipments were made, (2) the brands of cigarettes shipped,  and (3) the quantities of cigarettes shipped. (Jenkins Act 15 U.S.C. 375 &ndash; 378) </p>
        <p>Consumers should also be aware that cigarettes manufactured in  the U.S. and labeled and shipped for export cannot be brought back into the  U.S. except by the original manufacturer or by an export warehouse proprietor  authorized by the original manufacturer.&nbsp;  No quantity of cigarettes originally manufactured in the U.S. for export may be brought back into the U.S. by you as  a consumer, except for the limited quantity that you are allowed to bring back  into the country as a returning traveler.&nbsp;  This prohibition applies to even small Internet purchases that you make  for your own personal use.&nbsp; Cigarettes  manufactured in the U.S.  for export are required to have a notice on the package.&nbsp; In general, this notice is: &ldquo;U.S. Tax-exempt.  For use outside the U.S.&rdquo;&nbsp; Packages bearing the export mark may not be  sold or held for sale for domestic consumption in the U.S. and are subject to seizure by U.S.  officials.</p>
        <p><strong><a name="t2" id="t2"></a>T2: What Federal laws does the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB)  enforce concerning</strong> <a href="faq_answers.shtml#t11">tobacco  products</a>?&nbsp; <br />
          <br />
          In  general, TTB enforces <a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title26/subtitlee_chapter52_.html" target="_blank">Chapter 52 of the Internal Revenue Code</a>  (Title 26 of the United States  Code). <u><a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title26/subtitlee_chapter52_.html" target="_blank">Chapter  52 of the Internal Revenue Code</a></u> deals mainly with the Federal excise taxes on <a href="faq_answers.shtml#t11">tobacco  products</a> and cigarette papers and tubes and other requirements, such as  permits required for engaging in business related to the manufacture,  importation and other operations involving such products. <br />
          <br />
          <strong><a name="t3" id="t3"></a>T3:&nbsp; What other  Federal laws relate to tobacco products and who enforces these other Federal  laws?</strong></p>
        <p>As of July 5, 2007, the  following Federal laws related to tobacco products apply.&nbsp; Please note that this list may not be  comprehensive, is subject to change, and is provided for general information  purposes only. &nbsp;TTB does not administer,  enforce, or interpret these statutory provisions.&nbsp; For any questions about a statutory provision  listed here, please contact the agency responsible for its administration.</p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li><strong>Jenkins       Act (15 U.S.C. 375 &ndash; 378). &nbsp;</strong>In general, under the Jenkins Act, cigarette       vendors who sell and ship cigarettes into another state to anyone other       than a licensed distributor must report to the receiving State (1) the       name and address of the person(s) to whom cigarettes shipments were made,       (2) the brands of cigarettes shipped, and (3) the quantities of cigarettes       shipped.&nbsp; Reports must be filed with       a State&rsquo;s tobacco tax administrator no later than the 10th day       of each calendar month covering each and every cigarette shipment made to       the State during the previous calendar month.&nbsp; The sellers must also file a statement       with the State&rsquo;s tobacco tax administrator listing the seller&rsquo;s name,       trade name (if any), and address of all business locations.&nbsp; Failure to comply with the Jenkins Act&rsquo;s       reporting requirements is a misdemeanor offense, and violators are to be       fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than 6 months, or       both.&nbsp; The Bureau of Alcohol,       Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives and the Federal Bureau of       Investigation, U.S. Justice Department enforces these provisions of law.</li>
          <li><strong>Contraband       Cigarette Trafficking Act (18 U.S.C.

        <p>The  Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act, in part requires each manufacturer,  packager, or importer of smokeless tobacco products to annually submit to the  Department of Health and Human Services the list of ingredients added to  tobacco in the manufacture of smokeless tobacco products (Ingredient  Report).&nbsp;&nbsp; It further requires the  submission of the quantity of nicotine contained in each smokeless tobacco  product (Nicotine Report).&nbsp; The Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Office on Smoking and Health (OSH),  has been delegated the responsibility of implementing these provisions.&nbsp; More information can be found at  www.cdc.gov/tobacco. </p>
        <p>In addition to the reporting  requirements, under the FCLAA, Federal Trade Commission has administrative  responsibilities for the Surgeon General's health warnings required for  cigarettes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The FTC has both  administrative and enforcement responsibilities for the health warnings  required for smokeless tobacco packaging and advertising under the  Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The FTC&rsquo;s regulations specify the  placement and rotation of the warnings on these products, and require companies  to submit plans to the Commission setting forth their rotation schedules.

          <li><strong>Importation  requirements</strong>.&nbsp; U. S.  Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collects the Federal excise tax as well as  customs duties and other fees imposed on imported tobacco products, and  enforces the statutory requirement that persons engaged in the business of  importing tobacco products first obtain a TTB permit.&nbsp; Separate from TTB requirements, CBP also  requires certain records and reports (19 U.S.C. 1484).&nbsp; In addition, CBP enforces some statutory  provisions related to markings on imported products.&nbsp; In general, under 19 U.S.C. 1304, every  article of foreign origin, or its container, imported into the United States  must be conspicuously marked with the English name of the country of origin of the  article. &nbsp;More information about  importation requirements can be found at www.cbp.gov. </li>

          Like all Federal agencies, TTB publishes official notices of its actions in the <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/index.html" target="_blank">Federal  Register</a>, a publication of the Government Printing Office. The <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/index.html" target="_blank">Federal  Register</a> is published daily, both on paper and online. &nbsp;Notices are also available for viewing through <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/component/main" target="_blank">Regulations.gov</a>  a Federal government Web site  whereby the public can search, view, and comment on any Federal regulatory  actions. &nbsp;<br />
          When  you access the Federal Register online, you can search by subject or use the  Browse Feature to view the Table of Contents of any recent issue. Using either  of these means, you can view a document as either a text file or as a PDF file,  using Adobe Acrobat. In addition, we place a copy of these documents in <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/component/main" target="_blank">Regulations.gov</a>   shortly after the Federal Register makes the documents available through their Web  site. When you access a notice of proposed rulemaking through <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/component/main" target="_blank">Regulations.gov</a>   you will have an opportunity to submit a comment in response to the  rulemaking.&nbsp; You may also mail your  comment to us by using the contact information in the Federal Register notice.&nbsp; <br />
          <br />
          As  part of publishing a document, the Federal Register places a copy of the  manuscript &quot;on file&quot; in its offices the day before it is printed. &nbsp;&nbsp;The public may view the document at that  time. Call the Federal Register for details at (202) 741-6000. <br />

          <strong><a name="t12" id="t12"></a>T12: What are tobacco products?</strong> <br />

          <br />
          The  only law that TTB enforces that relates to advertising of <a href="faq_answers.shtml#t11">tobacco  products</a> and cigarette papers and tubes is a prohibition against lottery  features and indecent, immoral picture, print or representation attached to such packages.&nbsp; Refer to <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&amp;docid=Cite:+26USC5723" target="_blank">section 5723(c) of Title  26 of the United States Code</a>.&nbsp; For advertising in general for such  products, the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Trade  Commission</a> may be helpful.&nbsp; The Federal Trade Commission enforces a  variety of federal antitrust and consumer protection laws. <br />

          <br />
          TTB  has conducted several examinations of samples of these products in the  past.&nbsp; All of the examinations concluded the products contained tobacco  and for Federal excise tax purposes  were cigarettes.&nbsp; See <a href="../rulings/69-488.htm">Revenue Ruling  69-488</a>. <br />

          <strong><a name="t16" id="t16"></a>T16: If I grow tobacco, do I need a license or permit from  the TTB?</strong> <br />
          <br />
          TTB does not license, or require a permit for, growing tobacco. In addition, TTB   does not regulate the sale of tobaccos that are not <a title="faq_answers.shtml#t11" href="faq_answers.shtml#t11">tobacco   products</a>. The <a href="http://www.usda.gov" target="_blank">U.S. Department of   Agriculture</a> may regulate the growing and sale of such   tobacco. &nbsp;You may find additional information from the <a href="http://www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA/webapp?area=home&amp;subject=landing&amp;topic=landing" target="_blank">U.S. Farm Service Agency</a>.    <br />

          <br />
          Under  Federal law and regulations, dealers must sell cigarettes or other <a href="faq_answers.shtml#t11">tobacco  products</a> from packages in which the manufacturer or importer originally  placed them. Manufacturers and importers must place certain notices and marks  on packages as required by <a href="../rrd/index.shtml">27 CFR part 40</a>. Dealers must not remove the cigarettes or other <a href="faq_answers.shtml#t11">tobacco  products</a> from their original package until the customer removes them, or  until the dealer removes them in the presence of the customer. For example,  dealers are prohibited from selling loose cigarettes that have been removed  from their packages and placed in a jar for sale. Dealers should also check  with their <a href="http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/link/link.html" target="_blank">State  agency</a> for additional restrictions. <br />

          <strong><a name="t21" id="t21"></a>T21: Are cigarettes marked &quot;not for sale&quot; or  &quot;complimentary&quot; subject to the new Floor Stocks Tax in 2002?</strong> <br />
          <br />
          If  cigarettes are sold &quot;complimentary/not for sale&quot; as a promotion such  as &quot;buy two, get one free,&quot; all three packs of cigarettes are subject  to floor stocks tax and must be included in the book or record inventory. <br />
          If  cigarettes are given away as &quot;complimentary/not for sale&quot; for a  promotion and not sold, these cigarettes are not subject to tax and do not have  to be included in the book or record inventory</p>
        <p><strong><a name="t22" id="t22"></a>T22: May I purchase, for my personal consumption or use, <a href="faq_answers.shtml#t11">tobacco  products</a> or cigarette papers or tubes on which Federal excise tax has not  been paid? </strong> <br />
          <br />
          You  may purchase, for your personal consumption or use, <a href="faq_answers.shtml#t11">tobacco  products</a> or cigarette papers or tubes on which the Federal excise tax has  not been paid if:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You are departing from the United States and purchase <a href="faq_answers.shtml#t11">tobacco  products</a> or cigarette papers or tubes from a duty-free shop (class 9  customs bonded warehouse) or an export warehouse proprietor qualified by the  Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB); OR</li>
          <li>You are entering the United States  with accompanying <a href="faq_answers.shtml#t11">tobacco  products</a> or cigarette papers or tubes purchased outside the United States under the conditions and the  quantities specified under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.  For example, a United States  resident who has traveled abroad generally may return with not more than 200  cigarettes, and not more than 100 cigars. For actual quantities that apply to  your situation upon returning to the United States, read <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/vacation/kbyg/" target="_blank">http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/vacation/kbyg/</a> or ask for &quot;Know Before You Go&quot; brochure from the U.S. Customs  and Border Protection. The limits apply even if you receive <a href="faq_answers.shtml#t11">tobacco  products</a> or cigarette papers or tubes as a gift. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Otherwise,  Federal law provides both criminal and civil penalties regarding sales of <a href="faq_answers.shtml#t11">tobacco  products</a> or cigarette papers or tubes, for personal consumption or use, on  which Federal excise tax has not been paid.</p>
