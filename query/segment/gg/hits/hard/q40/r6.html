<i>Note</i> <b>It is known that many more Allied merchant ships were
sunk by Japanese naval surface ships, aircraft, submarines, and
possibly in minefields planted by submarines. However, this is all that
I have been able to find names for. If you have additional documented
information on Allied merchant ship losses other than those listed
above, please contact either <a href="mailto:muir@carlnet.org">Dan Muir</a> or <a href="mailto:a.biemond@wxs.nl">Arie Biemond</a>.<br>
<blink><font color="red">NOTE !</font></blink> The list "Allied
Merchant Ship Losses" is not yet completely completed, and there still
may be some mistakes regarding some ships, so please take this
information (list) with some "reserve" and not as a final one. Mr. Dan
Muir and Mr. Arie Biemond are, however, trying to compile the list and
make it accurate as much as possible. Information about several ships
(like tonnage, date of sinking, name ...) are different in English and
Dutch sources, so they need to be examined again.</b>
</p><p>

<i>Note</i> <b>According to Roger Jordan's book, the British ships</b> <i>Silksworth, Autolycus, Malda, Shinkuang, Dardanus, Gandara</i> <b>and</b> <i>Indora</i> <b>were all sunk by the Japanese cruiser fleet in the Gulf of Bengal on April 6th, 1942, together with five other Allied ships.</b>
</p><p>

<i>Note</i> <b>The first Japanese merchant vessel sunk in the Pacific War 1941-1945 was freighter</b><i> Awazisan Maru</i><b>, sunk by RAAF aircraft on December 8th, 1941 off Kota Bharu, followed by the</b> <i>Takao Maru,</i> <b>sunk by USAAF aircraft on December 10th, 1941, West of Luzon.</b>

<i>Note</i> <b>The Dutch Merchant Navy lost during the World War Two in
total 525 merchant ships measuring 1.692.773 tons. The Merchant Ship
