        And in New York City, the conspiracy case against eleven men charged with 
        plotting to bomb city landmarks was in court today. A suspect in the case, 
        Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali declared his innocence before United States 
        District Court Judge Michael Mukasey, and he said he intended to retain 
        attorney William Kuntsler. Kunstler is also representing co-defendant 
        Ibrahim El-Gabrowny. Judge Mukasey has warned he will put Government agents 
        under oath to determine the sources of leaks in the case. Kunstler has 
        argued that the leaks are making it difficult to find an unbiased jury.</font></p>
      <font face="Times" size=4> 
      <p>Speaking at a forum last week, Kunstler laid out the strategy, which 
        he plans to follow in the trial. The renowned defense attorney says he 
        plans to attack the credibility of the Government&#146;s star witness. 
        More on the story from Paul DeRienzo.</p>
      <p><b>PAUL DeRIENZO</b>: Eleven people have been charged in the alleged 
        plot to bomb the United Nations building, FBI Headquarters, and the Lincoln 
        and Holland Tunnels. According to the FBI, the conspirators were captured 
        on June 24th in the act of mixing bomb-making chemicals at a rented garage 
        in Queens, New York. The alleged ring leader of the plot was Siddig Ali. 
        But several days later, Ibrahim El-Gabrowny was indicted in the same scheme.</p>
      <p>El-Gabrowny has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 
        Lower Manhattan since his arrest shortly after the World Trade Center 
        bombing. He wasn&#146;t charged in that attack but on lesser charges of 
        obstruction of justice and possession of five forged Nicaraguan passports. 
        The passports contain the names and photos of El Sayyid Nosair and his 
        family.</p>
      <p>Nosair is in Attica Prison doing time on gun charges related to the assassination 
        of right-wing Jewish leader, Meir Kahane. The Government alleges that 
        the passports were part of a plot to break Nosair out of jail, but attorney 
        William Kunstler says that the Government&#146;s case is a product of 
        the FBI&#146;s confidential informant, Emad Salem, a former Egyptian Army 
        officer.</p>
      <p><b>WILLIAM KUNSTLER:</b> It was Salem who asked El-Gabrowny, some time 
        ago, for pictures of the Nosair family. He said he wanted to use them 
        for fund raising purposes. He took the pictures and attached them to phony 
        Nicaraguan passports which had been outlawed by [Nicaraguan President] 
        Mrs. Chamorro as soon as she replaced the Sandanista Government. So the 
        passports were invalid to start with. He gave the passports back to El-Gabrowny, 
        and he said to El-Gabrowny: &quot;We can break this man out of Attica 
        Correctional Facility and then get him off to Nicaragua with these passports.</p>
      <p>El-Gabrowny told him that was a crazy scheme and that he would have none 
        of it.</p>
      <p><b>PAUL DeRIENZO:</b> El-Gabrowny&#146;s trial for possessing the forged 
        passports is due to begin today. But last week, the Government convened 
        a grand jury that combined the cases of the men charged in the conspiracy 
        to bomb city landmarks with El-Gabrowny&#146;s case. Kunstler says that 
        the Government&#146;s strategy was designed to eliminate the possibility 
        of the informant, Emad Salem, from testifying in the relatively minor 
        passport case because, says Kuntsler, Salem cannot afford too much public 
        exposure as a witness. The source of Kunstler&#146;s assertion is testimony 
        in a civil trial several months ago after a car accident where Salem was 
        the victim.</p>
      <p><b>WILLIAM KUNSTLER:</b> He [Salem] told the jury, under oath, that he 
        had been one of [Egyptian President Anwar] Sadat&#146;s guards when Sadat 
        was assassinated, and that he had five bullets in his body from that experience. 
        You know, the Egyptian Government&#150;and I believe this is the only 
        truthful thing they&#146;ve told yet&#150;said that he had nothing to 
        do with Sadat, that he was not his guard, at all. Secondly, he divulged 
        that he had had amnesia since January of 1992, and that he had been going 
        to a psychiatrist by the name of Dr. Stein to help him with this situation. 
        Thirdly, he committed bigamy here in New York, for which he is NOT being 
        prosecuted. He married a woman here while he had a wife living in Egypt 
        who was still his wife. Fourthly, they got rid of his Federal tax lien. 
        The Government had a tax lien on him, and they got rid of that. And they 
        also got rid&#133;. he was marked as a persistent scofflaw by the parking 
        bureau here. Twenty- two tickets in a very short period of time. They 
        got rid of those tickets. And on the sheet of paper, which quashes the 
        tickets, it says: &quot;On Federal Business&quot;.</p>
      <p>He [Salem] is the only real conspirator in this case.</p>
      <p><b>PAUL DeRIENZO:</b> Kunstler charges that the Government&#146;s wiretaps 
        back up his contention that the defendants were entrapped by Salem.</p>
      <p><b>WILLIAM KUNSTLER:</b> I&#146;ve read a lot of the tapes by now&#150;transcriptions 
        of the tapes, which were just furnished to me today. Before I came here, 
        I read some of them, and they are things like&#133; having him [Salem] 
        say:</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, I think we ought to bomb the George Washington Bridge. That&#146;s 
        a very good target. It would make the commuters raise hell with this Government 
        of ours.&quot;</p>
      <p>And so then Siddig Ali says:</p>
      <p>&quot;Yeah?&quot;</p>
      <p>[Salem]: &quot;And I think&quot; so and so&#133;</p>
      <p>[Ali]: &quot;Yeah?&quot;</p>
      <p>&#133;. and so on. That&#146;s the way it goes, virtually throughout 
        these HUNDREDS of pages of transcriptions. There are a hundred and fifty 
        hours of tapes. A lot of them are in Arabic. Some are in English. But 
        this is the kind of man they&#146;re going to put on the [witness] stand.</p>
      <p><b>PAUL DeRIENZO:</b> Kunstler adds that Salem was the recipient of between 
        two hundred fifty thousand and one million dollars for his services as 
        an informant&#150;plus moneys paid to him by other sources linked to foreign 
        governments, including money from an organization founded by assassinated 
        Rabbi Meir Kahane.</p>
      <p><b>WILLIAM KUNSTLER</b> [attorney]: He [FBI informant Emad Salem] also 
        received money from Kahane Chai, Rabbi Meir Kahane&#146;s group. Probably 
        from a lot of other people. [Israel&#146;s secret service,] the Mossad 
        is not someone to exclude. Probably [received money] from the Egyptian 
        Government. He was a lieutenant colonel in the Egyptian Army, which apparently 
        he was.</p>
      <p><b>PAUL DeRIENZO:</b> Kunstler said that, despite the United States Government&#146;s 
        move to protect the informant, he&#146;s going to enjoy attacking Salem&#146;s 
        credibility during the trial.</p>
      <p><b>WILLIAM KUNSTLER:</b> He&#146;s just a dirty son-of-a-bitch. But he&#146;s 
        THEIR son-of-a-bitch, you see. He&#146;s not ours. And they did NOT want 
        to expose him in this minor trial. We&#146;re going to have a good time 
        with him if only we can get the jury to think&#150;think that maybe [our] 
        Government DOES lie once in a while. Maybe Government wants to use this.</p>
