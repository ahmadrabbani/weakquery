 The Oklahoma City Bombing

  The Oklahoma City Bombing           There are many unanswered questions about the Oklahoma City Bombing, and many people are convinced that the official explanation omits many important facts.          Many important issues are handled very superficially by television news shows.  If you're looking for details on important stories, you'll find that today's TV news is "all sizzle and no steak."  That's because it's safer and easier and less expensive for TV news editors to tell you only the federal or state government's side of each story.  (This is especially true if the government is in possession of almost all the physical evidence.)  It would take a lot of effort and expense to put conflicting viewpoints on television.  After all, a documentary is a lot of work.  That's especially true with a controversial topic like the Oklahoma City bombing.  The official explanation of the Oklahoma City bombing, dispensed with no questions asked by the national news media,  just doesn't add up. And there are a number of sidebar issues in this story that are just a little too suspicious.  For example, the remains of the half-destroyed Federal building were demolished just a few weeks after the explosion.  What was the rush?  A crime scene of this importance is usually pored over for months after the incident.  (People are still visiting the scene of the Kennedy assassination every day, studying all the distances and angles.  A substantial percentage of the people roaming around Dealey Plaza do not believe the official lone-gunman explanation.)  So why was the Murrah Building leveled so quickly? This page gets a lot of hits.  Apparently there are many people interested in this topic, for a variety of reasons.  I suspect there are many people who distrust the national news media and the federal government as a result of the way this incident was reported. When you're finished here, be sure to visit the   Home Page  .  The latest:    Did Juan Williams Link Christians to The Oklahoma City Bombing?    [Scroll down]  Williams' premise is simply not correct.  You see, Timothy McVeigh was not a "Christian terrorist."  He was born of Christian parents and lived in a nominally Christian culture, sure, but he did not perpetrate his crime  in the name of the Christian God .  On the other hand, the Saudi terrorist  did kill thousands in the name of their Muslim God.  Thus, Williams' claim that we didn't hold McVeigh's crime against Christians is a logical fallacy at the outset because McVeigh was neither representative of, nor claimed to be representing, Christians, Christianity, nor a Christian God when he bombed the Murrah Federal Building in 1995.  FBI Official to Federal Judge: OKC Bombing Videotapes 'Might Have Been Misfiled'  .  In a response filed yesterday to a federal judge's order May 11, an FBI official offered no denials about the existence of video images captured by more than 20 surveillance cameras operating prior to 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, in the vicinity of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City.  Instead, he explained that officials at the bureau merely cannot find the tapes and raised the possibility that they "might have been misfiled and thus could be located somewhere other than in the OKBOMB file (though it would be impossible to know where)."  Final Chapter of OKC Bombing Not Yet Written  .  Most members of the mainstream news media consider the investigation into the Oklahoma City Bombing closed and have, for the most part, stopped writing about it.  And then there are people like me and Wes Vernon, a Washington, D.C.-based writer and veteran broadcast journalist who writes for Renew America.  I think it's safe to say, both of us believe the final chapter about the bombing is yet to be written.  Families Observe Okla. City Bombing Anniversary  .  Sixteen years after a bomb destroyed the Oklahoma City federal building, survivors of the attack and family members of its 168 victims have gathered at the building's former site to observe the anniversary.  Oklahoma City bomber threatened within prison walls?    Terry Nichols, serving life without parole in the supermax prison ADX Florence in Colorado for his part in the Oklahoma City bombing (1995), says "John Doe 2" — a mysterious accomplice in that terrorist act — does exist.  Nichols has offered "not so subtle hints" of foreign complicity in the terror attack.  Meanwhile, Hussain al-Hussaini — identified by multiple witnesses as "John Doe 2" in the murderous attack that killed 171 innocent people — is due for a hearing April 26 in the Boston area, where he has been jailed on unrelated mayhem charges.  Confession of the Oklahoma City Bomber: John Doe 2 Exists  .  The conviction of American terrorists, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, symbolizes the FBI's crown jewel of criminal prosecutions.  So why do questions linger?  Does the official account of what transpired on April 19, 1995 reveal all that certain federal investigators know?  In the wake of the 1995 bombing, national polls showed 80 percent of Americans believed additional conspirators evaded capture.  Today, as the 16th anniversary approaches, the prospect of shadowy terrorists walking free still pervades the country's psyche.  This time, however, the FBI itself is fueling the flames of public distrust.  "Homeless" Man Hussain Hashem al-Hussaini is "John Doe #2 in Oklahoma bombing  .  On Wednesday [3/9/2011], a "homeless man" was arrested in the Boston suburb of Quincy, Massachusetts, on a charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon after allegedly striking another man with a beer bottle.  His name is Hussain Hashem al-HUSSAINI, although has several other aliases and a previous arrest record.  His arrest would have likely gone unnoticed except for the tenacious investigative journalism conducted in the months and years following the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City by author and investigative journalist Jayna Davis.  Author links man arrested in Quincy to the Oklahoma City bombing  .  It was a routine call for Quincy police about two homeless men fighting.  Hussain Al-Hussaini was arrested.  The victim was taken to the hospital.  Then came the surprise.  Readers commenting on a story about Wednesday's arrest on The Patriot Ledger's website noted that a man with the same name was mentioned prominently in a book about the deadly bombing of an Oklahoma City federal building in 1995.  Iraqis linked to Oklahoma atrocity  .  The FBI is under pressure from the highest political levels in Washington to investigate suspected links between Iraq and the Oklahoma bombing.  Senior aides to US Attorney-General John Ashcroft have been given compelling evidence that former Iraqi soldiers were directly involved in the 1995 bombing that killed 185 people.  The methodically assembled dossier from Jayna Davis, a former investigative TV reporter, could destroy the official version that white supremacists Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were solely responsible for what, at the time, was the worst act of terrorism on American soil.  Was the Oklahoma City bombing the silver bullet that could have prevented 9-11?    Is this Iraqi man, likely a member of Unit 999 of the Iraq Intelligence Service, John Doe #2?  Jayna Davis was among the first correspondents on the scene of the Oklahoma City bombing.  During the past nine years, Jayna has compiled a comprehensive and compelling investigative dossier, which unveils the Middle East's hand in the Oklahoma bombing.  Her new book ... expertly examines the connections between the Oklahoma City bombing, Iraq, and possibly even Al Qaeda.  Editor's note:  The article immediately above is a synopsis of a   book  by   Jayna Davis  that comprises a great deal of reliable information about the Oklahoma City bombing and the subsequent  cover-up , frankly, of a number of important loose ends in the government's investigation.  I would like to believe that the fine folks at the FBI and BATF are merely following orders from higher up, but it certainly appears that the investigators know about witnesses and evidence that they would prefer to suppress.  The most astonishing aspect of this whole story is the malleability of the news media.  At first the local TV stations were spreading an all points bulletin for John Doe #2, and before long they just dropped him down the memory hole, hoping nobody would notice.  Jayna Davis, from KFOR-TV, is apparently the only reporter who didn't let the matter drop.  As a result, she had a number of unpleasant experiences which she relates in her book.  If you have even a mild interest in the Oklahoma City story, I urge you to buy the book.  Before Able Danger and Mohamed Atta, There Was Murrah Building Bombing and Hussain Al-Hussaini  .  Captain Ed notes the Pentagon's decision yesterday to bar several military officials and intelligence analysts from testifying today before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing investigating whether the Able Danger program identified Mohamed Atta months before the 9/11 attacks.  The Pentagon's decision to keep the witnesses silent "only demonstrates that the program found something that the Pentagon still wants hidden," according to the Captain.  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter is less unconcerned about the Pentagon's action, saying his panel has already established the credibility of other witnesses who will testify at the hearing.  The Oklahoma City Bombing: 30 Unanswered Questions  .  [#11] Why did the Director of the University of Oklahoma's Geological Survey, Dr. Charles Mankin, tell the media that according to two different seismographic records there were TWO blasts, the second approximately eight seconds after the first?  [#12] The news media initially reported that there were two explosions, based on eyewitness testimony.  Why did this version of events disappear from print and the air waves within twenty-four hours?  The Real Story of the Oklahoma City Bombing  .  While liberal news outlets such as MSNBC were cynically exploiting the April 19 anniversary of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing by attempting to tie the terrorist attack to the anti-government sentiments of the modern-day Tea Party movement, investigative reporter Jayna Davis was setting the record straight in an exclusive interview on the AIM radio show, Take AIM.  The Oklahoma City bombing was an Arab/Muslim terrorist attack on the United States, she says.  Davis, author of a blockbuster book on the attack,  The Third Terrorist , has examined and presented the evidence showing that Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh was in fact a front man for Middle Eastern terrorists.  The third terrorist, in addition to the two, McVeigh and Terry Nichols, who were convicted, was an Arab.  This was the mysterious "John Doe" who was never found.  Podcast:  Jayna Davis on OKC Third Terrorist  .  [Scroll down]  The most incriminating testimony centers around just one man, who not only fit the FBI's physical description in the official arrest warrant for the infamous John Doe Two, McVeigh's elusive accomplice, who was never captured, but according to Federal law enforcement officers this man, an Iraqi soldier known as Hussein Hashem al-Hussaini, was a dead ringer for the third profile sketch that was issued for John Doe Two.  Now witnesses identified Hussein al-Hussaini in the company of McVeigh.  He was, prior to the bombing, at a local bar; he was seated in the passenger seat of the Ryder truck that carried the bomb the morning of April 19th; he was seen by a witness stepping out of that truck at ground zero, right in front of the federal complex; he was seen speeding away from downtown seconds after the blast in a brown Chevrolet pickup.  The Tea Party, Timothy McVeigh, and Tainted History  .  [Scroll down slowly]  To this day, the FBI has failed to investigate the multiple sightings of Iraqi Republican Guardsman Hussain Al-Hussaini in the presence of Timothy McVeigh prior to the bombing, exiting the bomb-laden Ryder truck the morning of April 19, and escaping the ill-fated Murrah Building in a getaway vehicle pursued by the FBI in an all-points-bulletin issued for Middle Eastern terrorists.  More significantly, two federal court rulings establish that this Iraqi soldier has no provable alibi for the morning of the bombing.  The FBI never questioned Hussain Al-Hussaini and has refused repeated requests from Congress and the press to clear him officially of complicity in the Murrah Building bombing.  Why?  It is my firm belief that Bill Clinton and Janet Reno should be called upon to answer that question. Amazon review of Jayna Davis's book:    The Third Terrorist: The Middle East Connection to the Oklahoma City Bombing  .  Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were not the lone conspirators in the Oklahoma City bombing-the attack that killed nearly 170 people in a few short seconds.  They were part of a greater scheme, one which involved Islamic terrorists and at least one provable link to Iraq.  This book, written by the relentless reporter who first broke the story of the Mideast connection, is filled with new revelations about the case and explains in full detail the complete, and so far untold, story behind the failed investigation — why the FBI closed the door, what further evidence exists to prove the Iraqi connection, why it has been ignored, and what makes it more relevant now than ever. Another new book:    Deadly Secrets: Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City Bombing  .  "Beyond the thousand-yard stare, beneath the buzz cut, there was another Timothy McVeigh.  Now America finally gets to meet the real Oklahoma City Bomber, and hear his shocking account of his crime, as reported by McVeigh's fellow death row inmate, David Paul Hammer."  Grain of salt:  This book was written by a death row inmate — a man who has nothing to gain by telling the truth and nothing to lose by publishing a work of fiction as some kind of exposé.  The author's   biography  shows that "he is serving 1232 years for his 11 convictions."  Even if the book is completely truthful and accurate, who would believe him?  Nevertheless, the publication of this book may help keep the Oklahoma City story from going down the memory hole quite as fast.  The Left's Blind Eye to the Obvious  .   All witnesses who saw Timothy McVeigh on the morning the Murrah Building blew up saw him with a short, swarthy fellow.  According to the  Washington Post , a judge detained McVeigh without bail "after listening to four hours of testimony from FBI special agent John Hersley in which he described eyewitness  accounts of a yellow Mercury with McVeigh and another man inside speeding away from a parking lot near the federal building."  Oklahoma City bombing tapes erased  .  Security tapes of the Oklahoma City bombing just released had key sections erased.  Salt Lake City attorney Jesse Trentadue obtained the security camera tapes of the bombing through the Freedom of Information Act.  After many years of secrecy around these critical tapes, the missing portions only fuel conspiracy fires.  Secret Oklahoma City Bombing Tapes Released:  Claims of FBI Doctoring  .  The F.B.I. finally released 20 secret, long-held security camera tapes of the deadly 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, after a Freedom of Information Act request from Utah attorney Jesse Trentadue.  The disturbing, soundless images don't show the actual bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, on 9:02 a.m. April 19, 1995, but do provide images of the chaos, minutes after the bombing, captured from security tapes of nearby buildings.  Attorney:  Oklahoma City bombing tapes appear edited  .  Long-secret security tapes showing the chaos immediately after the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building are blank in the minutes before the blast and appear to have been edited, an attorney who obtained the recordings said Sunday [9/27/2009].  Journalist Threatened For Exposing Cover-Ups  .  A journalist who has uncovered evidence of al-Qaeda involvement in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 has been threatened with a lawsuit by powerful U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald.  Government officials blamed the crash of TWA Flight 800, which killed 230 people, on a mysterious mechanical malfunction, while the Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168, was quickly labeled the work of domestic "right-wing" terrorists.  Accuracy in Media has long maintained that Clinton Administration officials concealed the truth about both incidents. Did someone mention   TWA 800  ?  Team O Turns Left on Sanity with "Right-Wing Extremists"  .  Hollywood-fantasy-turned-Washington-reality isn't simply crummy entertainment.  It presents a grave menace to political discourse in this country.  "We want to move away from the politics of fear," Napolitano declared last month to explain her new secretary-caused euphemism for Islamic terrorism.  But not too far.  That is, Napolitano, who supports the DHS report, is plenty content to deal in the politics of fear — just not fear of Islam.  Fear of conservatism, however, is OK by her.  How to make it stick?  The DHS report repeatedly reaches back for inspiration to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing... More about the   DHS report  .  Update:  A two-year congressional investigation shows the FBI made serious errors while investigating the Oklahoma City bombing.  The reports of the committee's work hit the news wires late in the afternoon on Sunday, December 24, 2006.  What better time could there be to release a news story, in order to draw the absolute minimum of attention to it, and provoke the least discussion?  Report faults FBI's Oklahoma City bomb probe  .  The FBI failed to fully investigate information suggesting other suspects may have helped Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols with the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, allowing questions to linger more than a decade after the deadly attack, a congressional inquiry concludes.  FBI Chided for OKC Bomb Investigation  .  A two-year congressional inquiry into the Oklahoma City bombing concludes that the FBI didn't fully investigate whether other suspects may have helped Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols with the deadly 1995 attack, allowing questions to linger a decade later.  The House International Relations investigative subcommittee will release the findings of its two-year review as early as Wednesday, declaring there is no conclusive evidence of a foreign connection to the attack, but that far too many unanswered questions remain.  The Oklahoma City Bombing Case Revelations  :  The OKC bombing was a failed federal sting operation that was, and still is, being covered up by federal officials and bureaucrats.  Officials had prior warnings from domestic and Islamic terror groups and foreign governments including West Germany and Israel.  But the officials also had their own prior warnings because of intelligence they had gathered from informants and provocateurs that U.S. government agencies had planted within the groups responsible for carrying out the OKC bombing.  The government officials and agents involved are criminally and civilly liable because they did not have adequate fail-safes built in to warn the public or preempt the OKC bombing if things got out of control.  Were there additional explosive charges and additional bombers?    The minister who married my wife and I was in OK City right after the Murrah Building bomb(s) exploded, and he volunteered to help dig for survivors.  He told of three very odd occurrences.  In the first, he was required to show his ID six times before being allowed to help look for survivors.  In the second, he confirmed the stories told by others that men in suits and ties were literally stepping over the wounded in their haste to gather up files and certain other items in the debris.  Lastly, and the oddest story of all, he told of more men in suits and ties taping plastic sheeting over portions of the building wreckage!  Was Iraq Behind the Oklahoma City Bombing?    On Tuesday's show [4/19/2005] you heard FOX News' Rita Cosby talking about the quite shocking claims made by a group of victims' families that Iraq was at the bottom of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing in Oklahoma City.  This has come up before: A reporter named Jayna Davis has a book out about it.  A Morass of Unanswered Questions  .  [Scroll down]  The problem is that the official account of what happened in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, has more holes than Swiss cheese.  Every independent investigation I am aware of has concluded that others besides Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were involved, though they diverge on the details.  Some pick up on obscure remarks in McVeigh's recent letter to Fox News as pointing to a connection between the bombing and the leading terrorist Osama bin Laden, suggesting that Terry Nichols met with bin Laden's agents in the Phillipines two months earlier to help plan the bombing.  Jayna Davis, an NBC reporter in Oklahoma City, claimed to have turned up evidence that McVeigh was involved with Iraqi immigrants.  Feds failed to follow bombing evidence  .  For years, Salt Lake City attorney Jesse Trentadue has maintained his brother was killed in prison months after the Oklahoma City bombing by interrogators who mistakenly believed he was connected to the attack.  Now, a new congressional report says federal authorities failed to investigate evidence suggesting Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols had assistance plotting the bombing — and some of the information pointing to co-conspirators came out of Trentadue's lawsuits against the FBI.  Latest OKC Bombing Probe Finds New Ramzi Yousef Leads, But No Smoking Gun  .  A new Congressional report outlines additional — but still circumstantial — links between Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry Nichols and World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef.  Titled "The Oklahoma City Bombing:  Was There A Foreign Connection?," the investigation was conducted by the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House International Relations Committee, at the request of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif.  Full Text of the Congressional Report  .  Oklahoma Bombing Chronology  .  14 Islamic Terrorist Suspects Identified in OKC Bombing  .  The FBI issued an all points bulletin (APB) in OKC for two weeks starting after the OKC bombing on April 19, 1995.  The APB said to be on the look out for two Middle Eastern males seen fleeing the scene in a late model brown Chevy truck with a bug shield moments for the Murrah Federal building was bombed by Timothy McVeigh and "others unknown."  According to news accounts, witnesses near the scene, including phone company employee, Kay Heron, identified Abraham Ahmad and Al Hussain Hussaini in the truck that was the subject of the FBI's APB.  Interesting:    Muslim Provocateurs in OKC Bombing Protected by Government Officials  .  In fact the US attorneys office in New York that prosecuted the 1993 WTC bombing case have been stonewalling. … The reason for the stonewalling may be because on the lists of conspirators prepared by US attorney Andrew McCarthy for the 1993 WTC bombing there are many of the same men also who are prime suspects in the OKC bombing, namely, Samir Khalil and his brother Akmed Yousef, Ali Mohammad, Menepta, Anis and Asad Siddiqy, and Mohammed Chafti.  An Islamist Connection to OKC Bombing  .  The mainstream media have gone AWOL again -- this time by missing the complete story on the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.  There are leads suggesting the bombing that killed 168 innocent American men, women, and children had been ordered by Saddam Hussein -- then in power in Iraq, and possibly with the help of other Middle East terrorists.  Lawyer pursues links between neo-Nazis, Oklahoma City bombing  .  Kenneth Trentadue's body bore severe cuts and contusions, and signs of possible strangulation with a pair of plastic handcuffs, but prison officials insisted he committed suicide by hanging himself with a bedsheet.  What potentially linked him to the Oklahoma City bombing was his strong resemblance to one of the members of the neo-Nazi bank robbery gang that the FBI was investigating for possible ties to McVeigh.  Jesse Trentadue believes federal agents mistook his brother for one of the bank robbers, killed him during an interrogation about the Oklahoma City bombing and then tried to cover up the crime — a belief fueled by the disappearance of key evidence in the case and the rush by prison authorities to scrub Trentadue's cell before any investigators could examine it.  [Richard Lee] Guthrie was arrested on bank robbery charges in 1996 and eventually struck a plea bargain with prosecutors.  In fall 1996, he claimed he would soon be revealing information that "would blow the lid off the Oklahoma City bombing case," according to the report.  The next day, he was found dead, hanging in his cell in Kentucky, purportedly a suicide.    *     The Third Terrorist:  The Middle Eastern Connection to the Oklahoma City Bombing  .  Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were not the lone conspirators in the Oklahoma City bombing -- the attack that killed nearly 170 people in a few short seconds.  They were part of a greater scheme, one that involved Islamic terrorists and at least one provable link to Iraq.  Was OKC Bomber Timothy McVeigh Working for the FBI?    In a 19-page affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City, convicted Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry Lynn Nichols alleges that the bombing plot was actually under the supervision of top FBI officials.  Papers at UT show McVeigh had little remorse  .  Timothy McVeigh appeared to show little remorse as he described for his attorneys how he bombed the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, according to defense documents donated to the University of Texas at Austin.  The Clinton legacy Hillary wants you to forget  :  President Clinton took no action after the first World Trade Center attack in 1993.  There was proof-positive of a third terrorist with definitive connections to Middle Eastern Terrorists in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, that was never fully investigated and hidden by the media.  No action was taken after the 1996 attacks on Kohbar towers is Saudia Arabia, nor the bombing of a U.S. embassy in Peru in 1998.  Book dispels Oklahoma City bomb conspiracy  .  In his new memoir, "On-Scene Commander," former FBI deputy director Weldon Kennedy criticizes those who believe federal authorities did not find all the people involved in the terrorist attack's planning.  "There's no possible way there were other conspirators," Kennedy wrote.  "I can say with total confidence that we identified all three conspirators in the case and arrested them."  The Unfinished Investigation:  al Qaeda links to the Oklahoma City bombing  .  Within hours of the Oklahoma City bombing, many observers of terrorist activity speculated that the attack may have been sponsored by Islamic extremists or other Middle Eastern interests.  When Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested in the case, the media pendulum swung to the other extreme, dismissing such early speculation as the result of ethnic and religious bigotry. … But new information continued to trickle out during the intervening years, and that trickle increased to a flood in the wake of the September 11 attack on America, which brought intense scrutiny of Islamic extremist "sleeper cells" operating on U.S. soil.  Based on this new information, there is good reason to re-examine our national assumptions about Oklahoma City.  Secret Service took thousands of phone records without court approval, documents show  .  A series of internal documents from the U.S. Secret Service obtained by this   newspaper  provide details of a project involving the transfer of thousands of telephone and bank records to a government database with the help of U.S. telephone and financial company executives.

OKC Bombing:  Precursor to 9-11?    Evidence links the OKC bombing to Middle Eastern terrorists, and the failure of officials to examine this evidence in 1995 may have set the stage for the September 11th attacks.  Agent:  Feds told of threats to blow buildings  .  Unearthed by a Salt Lake City, Utah, attorney, statements made by a Tulsa Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms agent in a federal courtroom confirm that a confidential informant did warn the agency of plans to bomb federal buildings before the attack in Oklahoma City that left 168 dead and hundreds more injured.  'Compelling' evidence of another terrorist  .  U.S. senator forecasts investigation by Congress.

OKBOMB case now open again, bombing documents ordered turned over to judge  .  A U.S. District Court judge in Salt Lake City, Utah, has ordered the Oklahoma City FBI office to turn over unredacted copies of all documents currently at issue in a Freedom of Information (FOIA) lawsuit involving additional evidence and the names of additional conspirators in the Oklahoma City bombing case.  Oklahoma City Bombing Questions  .  When the word first got out that no Federal agents had been present in the building, the BATF produced its Resident Agent Alex McCauley who told a long story about his own heroism and that of a fellow ATF man who allegedly fell three floors in an elevator, walked away from it, and then helped rescue others trapped by the bomb.  This was quickly exposed as a fabrication in an angry interview by building maintenance supervisor Duane James, who described McCauley's story as "pure fantasy". … The McCauley account was quietly retracted and flushed down the memory hole by the ATF, with the help of the media.  They now admit that McCauley was nowhere near the building when the bomb went off, although they refuse to discuss his exact whereabouts or the whereabouts of any other ATF agent at the time of the explosion.  Former high-ranking FBI official calls for new OKC bombing probe  .  A former deputy assistant director of the FBI with extensive experience in domestic terrorism cases is calling for additional investigation into the 1995 bombing of the A.P. Murrah Federal Building.  The Left's privacy hypocrites  .  According to the McCurtain Daily Gazette, in the days after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the U.S. government used a spy satellite to gather intelligence on a white separatist compound in Oklahoma. … Investigators zeroed in on the compound in nearby Elohim City. … Photoreconnaissance satellites that gather intelligence from space usually target hostile governments and foreign terrorists.  "The domestic use of a military satellite for domestic spying is a violation of DoD and CIA regulations regarding the proper use of top-secret national security satellites," the Gazette reported.  But with the exception of a brief Associated Press recap, the story received absolutely no mainstream-media attention.  Red Flags From an Expert  :  As one of the world's foremost experts in both the theoretical and practical applications of explosives technology, Brigadier General Benton K. Partin (USAF, retired) possesses virtually unparalleled qualifications to authoritatively evaluate the public-source information available on the bombing.  From the start, the general expressed very strong misgivings about the "official" story — that the horrendous damage to the federal building had been caused solely by the reported truck bomb.  Too many facts, he said, "simply just don't add up" to support that convenient explanation.  Helicopter Above Murrah at the Moment of the OKC Bombing  .  On the morning of April 19, 1995 a helicopter hovered near and then over the Murrah building before and after it was bombed at 9:02 am.  Several very reliable witnesses told me they saw this helicopter above the Murrah building. … Former Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating did a taped interview with FOX news reporter Rita Cosby in 1995 in which Keating acknowledged but ridiculed and downplayed the helicopter story.  Istook and the OKC Cover-up  :  Considerable independent evidence indicates that there was indeed official knowledge of specific prior warning before the Oklahoma City bombing.  That evidence includes:  • Many witnesses who saw bomb squad trucks and personnel around the Murrah Building before the blast. • The absence of ATF agents from their offices in the Murrah Building at the time of the blast. • ATF-FBI informant Carol Howe's testimony that she gave specific warning. • Federal informant Cary Gagen's testimony (supported by a corroborating witness) that he warned authorities on April 6th. • A U.S. Marshals' memo of March 22, 1995 warning of expected bomb attacks on federal buildings.

Did the Oklahoma City Bombers Have Help?  .  One month after the April 19, 1995, Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people, authorities demolished what was left of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.  Officials said the implosion was a necessary part of the psychological recovery for the citizens of Oklahoma City.  But critics question the FBI's tactics and argue the building came down too soon and the implosion is one piece of a government cover-up.  The FBI – A Legend Decays  .  For most Americans the Federal Bureau of Investigation ranked up there with motherhood and cherry pie.  They were a legend, clean as the fabled hound's tooth – an investigative agency whose work went unchallenged. … That's all over now – in the wake of the revelations about their activities in the Oklahoma bombing case they have been shown to be a dangerously unreliable government agency which has abused its enormous power in ways that boggle the imagination.  Was Timothy McVeigh Really Executed?    [Scroll down]  Shortly after the actual bombing, [Mike] Loudenslager was seen by many witnesses, including police officers and rescue workers, involved in a very "heated" confrontation.  Much of his anger being due to the fact that he felt that the B.A.T.F. and D.E.A. were responsible for the extent of the blast damage.  However to the astonishment of those who had seen him in the immediate aftermath of the bombing, it was later reported that Loudenslager was found at his desk, a victim of the 9:02 A.M. bombing.

FBI refused 22 eyewitness testimonies  .  Evidence implicating a Mideast connection created a 'discovery problem'.  Oklahoma City blast linked to bin Laden  .  A former investigative reporter for the NBC affiliate in Oklahoma City last night [3/20/2001] told Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly she has gathered massive evidence of a foreign conspiracy involving Saudi terrorist leader Osama bin Laden in the 1995 bombing of the federal building that killed 168 people.  OKC and WTC Bombers Met in the Philippines  .  Oklahoma City bomber Terry Nichols met with World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef in the Philippines before he and Timothy McVeigh carried out their plot, investigative reporter Jayna Davis said Wednesday [5/26/2004].  The Oklahoma City bombing  .  For six weeks, John Doe No. 2 is the most hunted man in the world until, without explanation, he just kind of goes away.  Emmy-award-winning filmmaker Jack Cashill traces the roots of Sept. 11 to the political exploitation of terror investigations by the Clinton White House in the desperate 1995-1996 election cycle.  This 8-part series begins in Oklahoma City. Editor's note:  Jack Cashill has written six books this decade, one of which, "Hoodwinked," dealt with literary fraud.  He has a Ph.D. in American studies from Purdue University.  *    You can read about one of his most recent investigations   here  .  The Oklahoma City aftermath  .  In the case of the Oklahoma City bombing, as we will see in the investigation of TWA Flight 800, the Clinton Justice department's most dazzling sleight of hand was to make the eyewitnesses disappear.  The FBI refused to even look at the material Oklahoma City TV reporter Jayna Davis had gathered.  Rather than put a single witness on the stand who could place McVeigh in or near Oklahoma City on April 19, the prosecution chose to build an entire case on circumstantial evidence.  Oklahoma City Bombing:  Startling Evidence Proves Government Cover-up  .  For the most part, the media has accepted and promoted the government's version of the bombing:  that McVeigh — with minor assistance from Terry Nichols — acted alone.  The one-man, one-bomb scenario.  Some writers, though, have questioned these conclusions.  Unresolved Deaths in Oklahoma  :  To the absolute astonishment of a large number of police officers and rescue workers, it was later reported that G.S.A. employee Mike Loudenslager's body had been found inside the Murrah Building the following Sunday, still at his desk, a victim of the 9:02 A.M. bombing!  This, mind you, after he'd already been seen alive and well by numerous rescue workers at the bomb-site AFTER the bombing!  He is also officially listed as one of the 168 bombing fatalities.  The question now becomes:  Was he murdered and placed at his desk by federal agents?  Or was he just simply murdered by them and SAID to have been found at his desk?  Access to the inside of the building, from shortly after the bombing onward was extremely limited to nearly all but federal employees by the F.B.I.  His death is UNQUESTIONABLY the most important sidelight of the Oklahoma City bombing.  It's dangerous to know too much  .  As in the Whitewater affair, Oklahoma City bombing witnesses are dying fast.  Two key witnesses in the Oklahoma City bombing case will not appear to testify at the Denver trial of Timothy McVeigh, one of the two accused of being responsible for the bombing, because they are dead.  One death has been labeled a suicide.  The other victim was killed in an air crash. Both deaths took place under questionable circumstances.  The Terrance Yeakey Story  :  Immediately, it became obvious to Officer Yeakey that a number of things about the "bombing" just didn't add up.  If this was a terrorist bombing, then why were police line already up behind the building when he first arrived, within two minutes after the fact?  And where had all of the ATF & FBI agents come in so quickly outside the building (most relatively unharmed) when he'd first gotten there as well?  The Murder of Oklahoma City Police Department Sgt. Terrance Yeakey  :  Sgt. Yeakey's death was NEVER properly investigated according to the basic standards of criminal law.  Consequently, his death was erroneously ruled a suicide vs. an unsolved homicide.  Public Officials Accessories to OKC Bombing Murders  .  Sworn testimony by US prosecutor Beth Wilkinson to federal Judge Matsch in Denver in a November 1996 hearing reveals that the entire federal family (included US Marshals, FBI, US judges, Congressman Istook, etc) in OKC was officially forewarned warned of an attack on Murrah a few weeks before the bombing.  [Congressman Ernest] Istook told an OKC bombing victim in a taped conversation shortly after the bombing that Istook knew that the OKC bombing was an FBI staged failed sting operation that the public did not have a right or need to know about since Istook said it was a national security operation.  Oswald and Dealey Plaza vs. McVeigh and the OKC Bombing  .  Many other questions remain to be answered, as in the Kennedy investigation, but will probably never be breached.  Questions such as:  Was there an Iraqi connection?  Were there actually two (or more) explosions?  Were there two or more other bombs inside the building?  Why did McVeigh's license tag "fall off" his car?  Why was the APB on the brown pickup not followed up on, then later cancelled altogether and denied to exist by the FBI?  Exactly what number was found on the truck axle that would identify the vehicle?  Why have we not seen photographs of this number plate?  Why was not John Doe #2, the Iraqi Republican Guard Division officer, not followed up in detail by the FBI?  And why, after it was shown there was no connection, did the media continue to shift public attention to right wing groups ranging from the NRA to various militia organizations when those entities had the most to lose from such a tragic event?  Death-penalty trial for Oklahoma bomb accomplice could backfire on FBI  .  A flurry of new evidence promises to demonstrate quite the opposite of what the prosecutors are hoping to prove:  that Nichols, far from being a key player in the conspiracy, was a relatively marginal figure, and that a gang of neo-Nazi bank robbers, hitherto ignored by federal and state prosecutors, had a far more prominent role.   Update and Correction:       30 Crucial OKC Bombing Questions Remain Unanswered  .  The statement that no federal agents were in the building when it blew up is not true.  There were eight federal agents who died in the building.  The Oklahoma City Bombing  :  According to the March 20, 1996 issue of Strategic Investment newsletter, a classified Pentagon study confirms that the Oklahoma bombing was caused by more than one bomb.  A classified report prepared by two independent Pentagon experts has concluded that the destruction of the federal building in Oklahoma City in April 1995 was caused by  five separate bombs.  Cover-up in OKC  .  In trying to pin the blame for the bombing solely on despicable mass-murderer Timothy McVeigh, federal officials have ignored and covered up evidence of a wider conspiracy.  FBI Cover-up Continues in OKC  .  The document in question is a hotel receipt for FBI agent Danny Coulsen, who was one of the Bureau's counter-terrorism experts in the mid-90s.  The electronic printout shows that Coulsen checked into the Oklahoma City Embassy Suites at twenty minutes after midnight on the morning of April 19, 1995 — more than 8½ hours before the multiple bombs decimated the Murrah Building. … Coulsen is not commenting about the document and has claimed that he was in Fort Worth, Texas on the morning of the 19th before driving to Oklahoma as soon as he learned of the tragedy at Murrah.  However, the FBI has listed these official records and all others on Coulsen prior to April 19, 1995, as "Missing".  So what else is new?  Conspiracy?  Oklahoma City Bombing  .  Timothy McVeigh claimed he acted alone. Yet, multiple eyewitnesses identified McVeigh at ground zero with unknown accomplices before and after the blast.  The original indictment charged McVeigh, Terry Nichols, and "others unknown" with conspiracy and murder.  Was the bombing part of a greater pattern of Middle East-sponsored terrorist attacks, including the 1993 World Trade Center attack, bombing of the Khobar Towers and the USS Cole, and 9/11?  The FBI's "Ten Most Un-Wanted List"  .  For the past two years, Oklahoma State Representative Charles Key, former grand juror Hoppy Heidelberg, Glenn and Cathy Wilburn, and a great many other Oklahomans have called attention to the many credible eyewitnesses who say they saw Timothy McVeigh with a man answering the description of John Doe No. 2, or with other men, on the morning of the Oklahoma City bombing.  Also important are the many witnesses who connect McVeigh and the Ryder truck with other John Does in Kansas. … However, federal prosecutors have pointedly excluded from their list of trial witnesses any of those who have attested to seeing anyone besides McVeigh.  Much more material about the OKC bombing  .  The Oklahoma City Bombing and the Middle East  .  Years Ahead on the OKC Cover-up  .  The Associated Press has recently reported some of the OKC bombing evidence  The New American first brought to light many years earlier.  (840k PDF)  Another Chance at OKC Justice?    The upcoming state trial of convicted OKC bomber Terry Nichols offers another chance to expose any co-conspirators — and any officials who have covered up crucial evidence.  Multiple Blasts in the OKC Bombing:  More Evidence  .  A new study analyzing explosive tests conducted by the U.S. Air Force against a reinforced concrete structure may provide an important key to understanding the Oklahoma City bombing.  The report, lends powerful support to the arguments of those experts who have challenged the official government position….  Witnesses heard multiple explosions  .  Multiple witnesses reported hearing more than one explosion the day the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City was bombed, while other explosives experts contend that the damage done to the building could not have been caused by a single bomb placed outside in a truck.  Oklahoma City:  Two Blasts and Strange Facts  .  A seismograph at Stillwater (50 miles away) measured two tremors.  Bomb experts say there is no way to direct a car bomb to utterly destroy a federal building and leave the YMCA across the street unaffected (window washers weren't even knocked off their scaffolding).  Retired Brigadier General Partin had much experience with explosives and visited OKC.  He found evidence of some supporting columns under the Murrah Building were pulverized while some closer to the street (and "car bomb") were intact.  Oklahoma City Bombing Cover-up  :  [Mike Loudenslager's] death is unquestionably the most important sidelight of the Oklahoma City bombing.  [His] murder, most assuredly was one of the major factors leading to the demise of both Dr. H. Don Chumley and later Terry Yeakey!  In an effort to cover up Mike Loudenslager's murder and to intimidate others who were there early-on that morning, someone has taken out a number of internal witnesses.  Dr. Don Chumley and Terry Yeakey, both, besides being at the Murrah Building that morning, shared one other commonality.  Each at the time of his death was attempting to deliver evidence concerning the fact Mike Loudenslager was alive and well after the bombing, and also to get certain other facts out about the bombing as well.  The 3rd terrorist:  Mideast tie to OKC bombing  .  Investigative reporter has evidence of Islamic plot.  The Oklahoma City Bombing:  What is the True Story?    There is evidence that the truck bomb could not have operated the way we have been told, and that there were in fact  two explosions.  There are reports that the Government knew of the blast ahead of time (why were ATF employees told not [to] be in the building that day?).  Key witnesses have mysteriously died (gee, where have we heard of  that before?).  There has been a coverup of huge proportions, hiding facts and unanswered questions from the public.   (Numerous additional links here.)     OKC Bombing's "Lost Information"  :  An analysis of raw news footage and reports in the immediate aftermath of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City, Okla., shows local television reporters stating repeatedly that two additional, sophisticated, undetonated explosive devices were found by investigators on the scene.  Ex-FBI Agents Call for New McVeigh Probe  :  FBI agents destroyed evidence and failed to share other information that raised the possibility that a gang of white supremacist bank robbers may have assisted Timothy McVeigh during the Oklahoma City bombing, according to documents never introduced at McVeigh's trial.  Was Timothy McVeigh Really Executed?    [Scroll down]  Significantly, by court order there was no autopsy and no cremation of his [McVeigh's] body after execution, this despite the fact that both are standard practise for executed prisoners.  Moreover according to reporters covering the execution, McVeigh seemed remarkably calm.  So there were no last minute nerves, no clinical autopsy, no cremation and maybe no body too?  The Murrah Building Cover-up (literally)  :  The minister who married my wife and I was in OK City right after the Murrah Building bomb(s) exploded, and he volunteered to help dig for survivors.  He told of three very odd occurrences. ...  What was Iraq's role in Oklahoma blast?    Lawyers want to question ambassador to U.N. before he leaves the U.S.  Was Tim McVeigh an agent of Iraq?    Top Defense officials think so, reports U.S. News.  Oklahoma City bombing John Doe No. 2?    Like the Kennedy assassination, many Americans remained deeply skeptical about the government's assurances that McVeigh and Nichols acted alone in this horrible crime.  And for good reason, as it seems that the FBI ignored important investigative leads, failed to interview potentially significant witnesses, and destroyed the Murrah building before experts could examine the crime scene.  Reporter stands by allegations  :  Jayna Davis rebuts critic and says evidence shows Iraq was involved in the OKC attack.  Update:    Reporter's Oklahoma City coverage vindicated  :  Appeals court dismisses defamation suit filed by Iraqi soldier.  Be sure to visit   Jayna Davis dot com  .  A body of compelling evidence proves that Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols did not act alone. … In 1995, the federal grand jury proclaimed in the official indictment that McVeigh and Nichols acted with "others unknown."  And several members of the Denver juries who convicted the two said publicly that they thought they had help.  Since 1997, Davis has repeatedly tried to interest the FBI in her investigation.  She has been rebuffed.  Iraqis linked to Oklahoma atrocity  :  The FBI is under pressure from the highest political levels in Washington to investigate suspected links between Iraq and the Oklahoma bombing.  Senior aides to US Attorney-General John Ashcroft have been given compelling evidence that former Iraqi soldiers were directly involved in the 1995 bombing that killed 185 people.  OKC Bombing Cover-Up  :  Numerous additional articles and lots of discussion about this incident and the loose ends that many people find so interesting.  Numerous other documents  :  The Tiffany Bible affidavit.  Press release from Arlene Blanchard.  FEMA situation report.  Statement by Jane Graham.  Statement by Joe Harp.  Oklahoma Highway Patrol radio logs.  The Oklahoma City Bombing  :  PROOF there were additional explosive charges.  Tiffany Bible affidavit  :  Tiffany Bible was a paramedic called to the Murrah Building following the bombing.  This affidavit reports three important facts.  1. The ATF were not in the building.  2. That the ATF was already putting out a story that the Murrah Building was bombed "because of Waco" only a few hours after the actual blast and before Tim McVeigh was even arrested.  3. That an unexploded bomb was found attached to a gas line inside the building.  Iraq Linked to 9-11 and Oklahoma City Bombing  :  The Wall Street Journal has added its voice to those - in and out of government - who have concluded the circumstantial evidence linking Saddam Hussein's Iraq to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the 1993 first World Trade Center bombing, as well as the 9-11 attacks, is overwhelming. Apocryphal but interesting:    Mysteries of the 2nd Ryder truck  .  Among many of the locals who vividly recall activities of McVeigh and Nichols, in the days before the bombing, the certain belief exists that the defendants (and other unknown persons) had, for a time, a second Ryder truck.  But when such information is passed to the FBI, witnesses say the agents don't appear interested or the sightings are wholly discounted.  The Importance of Jane Graham  :  Eyewitness accounts before the bombing strongly suggest that demolition charges were placed elsewhere.  On the Friday before the bombing several persons at the Murrah building saw three men (they took for maintenance or utility workers) "working" in a reserved area of the underground parking structure.  These men had what appeared to be a set of plans or "blue prints," telephone wire and a large block of "clay."

The Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee  :  More related stories and links.  More OKC bombing links  .  Turning the Tables on Oklahoma City  :  As the nation tried to figure out "whodunit," the political left already had an answer, and no amount of facts would change it:  "The killer was 'the political right.'"  Iraq link to OKC, Sept. 11 attacks?    An Oklahoma City attorney says he and others have gathered a "mountain" of evidence that implicates Iraq in both the Oklahoma City bombings and the September 11 attacks.  Terror Trail:  WTC, OKC, 9-11  .  Journalists and congressional investigators are beginning to trace the terror trail backward from 9-11 to Oklahoma City and the earlier World Trade Center bombing.  Why 9-11?    The FBI had no scientific evidence for concluding the OKC bombing was the result of an ammonium nitrate fertilizer bomb.  The Justice Department found that the explosives unit simply guessed that the bomb was made of 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate after the FBI found a receipt suggesting Terry Nichols had purchased that amount.  No tests were conducted.  No detonator was recovered.  Widespread Failure In McVeigh Case  :  Widespread failures by the FBI led to the belated disclosure of thousands of pages of documents that caused a one-month delay in the execution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, the Justice Department said in releasing the results of an investigation Tuesday [3/19/2002].  36,000 pages of undisclosed evidence?    Convicted Oklahoma City bomber Terry Nichols may get some help in his appeal as U.S. judges in Colorado consider whether some 36,000 pages of undisclosed FBI tips and evidence should be provided to his attorneys.  Oklahoma Bombing Linked to bin Laden  .  Was FBI early arrival in Oklahoma City?  :  The FBI's top counterterrorism agent checked into an Oklahoma City hotel nearly nine hours before a truck bomb nearly leveled the Alfred P. Murrah Building, according to a [hotel] receipt obtained by   WorldNetDaily  , despite claims that he was in Texas the morning of the attack.  Dead men tell no tales  .  What is the government hiding?  It is absolutely outrageous that after the millions of man-hours, the tens of millions in tax dollars spent, and the ultimate closing of the case by the execution of McVeigh, the government continues to withhold the surveillance videotapes from the day of the Murrah bombing.  The resurrection of President Clinton  :  The inspector general's report found that the FBI crime labs had "repeatedly reached conclusions that incriminated the defendants without a scientific basis" in the Oklahoma bombing case.  Oklahoma City's lost information :  Early accounts differ from today's 'official' explanation of the bombing.  Initial news broadcasts by KWTV-9, KFOR TV-5 and Channel 4 News all feature reports confirmed by state, local and federal officials that a total of three bombs had been placed inside the Murrah building.  Does the FBI have a hidden hero? The Trail of John Doe No. 2  :  For six weeks in the spring of 1995 this shadowy figure was the most hunted fugitive in the world.  OKC Legacy of Lies Lives On  :  The New American has been charging cover-up in the Oklahoma City bombing case for six years.  Now some FBI agents close to that investigation are making similar charges.  Author ties McVeigh to Aryan group  :  Criminologist says 10 others likely helped with 1995 assault.  Revealing the truth about OKC  :  Geoff Metcalf interviews bombing investigator Charles Key.  Pattern of Deceit Emerges From Bomb Investigation  :  Stephen Jones, former attorney for recently executed bomber Timothy McVeigh, says there appears to be a pattern of deceit emerging that points to FBI senior level management in charge of the bureau's OKBOMB investigation.  Jones made the comments after learning additional evidence in the bombing case may have been wrongly withheld from the defense team while he represented McVeigh.  Key Report on OKC Bombing  :  Timothy McVeigh has been punished for his crime, but the Final Report of the Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee indicates that other perpetrators remain at large.  We Will Not Forget  :  The McVeigh execution supposedly brings "closure" to those who survived or lost loved ones in the Oklahoma City bombing.  But what those survivors and victims really want is justice.  Unsung Hero:  Glenn Wilburn  .  Glenn and Kathy Wilburn recognized very early on that there was something terribly wrong with the federal investigation into the terrorist attack that took the lives of their grandsons Chase and Colton.  Astounded and angered at the government's refusal to follow some of the most important leads and its repeated cover-up of important evidence and testimony, the Wilburns launched their own intensive investigation.  Through their tireless efforts, many important witnesses and a great deal of vital evidence that had been previously suppressed has been brought to light.  The Truth Is Still Out There  :  A new book about Timothy McVeigh claims to be the definitive study of the Oklahoma City bombing.  In reality, it is merely a rehash of the old Justice Department "lone wolf" scenario.  Rubber Stamp Report on OKC  :  The long-awaited report of the Oklahoma County Grand Jury, released on December 30th, was undoubtedly cause for wild celebration and early New Year's merriment at the Clinton White House, Janet Reno's Justice Department, and Louis Freeh's FBI.  The grand jury, which had been empaneled in June 1997 to investigate the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, held the potential for exposing the massive bungling, corruption, cover-up, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and conspiracy that had been so blatantly evident in the biggest and deadliest terrorist case the federal government had ever prosecuted.  But the jury's report showed once again the awesome power of the federal apparatus — especially since the advent of the Clinton regime — to smother truth and subvert justice.  Ignoring mountains of contradicting evidence, the jury bent over backwards to produce a ludicrously glowing endorsement of the federal government's absurd lone-bomber/single-bomb theory.  OKC Grand Jury  :  Testimonies conflict with government story.  Oklahoma City terrorism report released  :  6-year investigation concludes the government "concealed" the truth. Major points outlined in the committee's report include:  Evidence suggesting the federal government had prior knowledge that the bombing was going to occur, and where;  Evidence others besides McVeigh and Nichols had a hand in planning the attack, securing the materials for the explosives, and carrying the bombing out;  Materials detailing the government's early assertion that other unexploded bombs were found by authorities immediately after the first bomb went off;  Failures by federal law and court officials before, during and after the bombing.  Judge in Bombing Trial Failed to Read Howe's ATF File  :  An examination of a sealed transcript made during a closed door session in the waning days of the Terry Nichols' bombing trial indicates that United States District Judge Richard P. Matsch admitted to lawyers for the government, and to Nichols, that he received Carol Howe's extensive and sensitive ATF informant file - months earlier - but never read it. Another case which is possibly related:  Lawyer outlines a broader conspiracy in search for FBI documents on Oklahoma City bombing  .  A Utah attorney alleges informants gathering information on Timothy McVeigh or his associates warned the FBI about the plot to bomb the Oklahoma City federal building but the agency took no action to stop the 1995 attack.  Jesse Trentadue also says there were others involved in carrying out the bombing besides McVeigh and Terry Nichols, despite investigators' conclusion that they were the only ones responsible for the crime.  The allegations are made in a brief filed Monday in a lawsuit by Trentadue, who believes his brother's death in a federal prison was linked to the bombing.  12 Years Later, John Doe No. 2 Remains Focus Of Conspiracy Theory  .  [Jesse] Trentadue's theory is full of intrigue.  He claims it points to a wide conspiracy, a conspiracy the government says did not exist.  He has collected volumes of information from the government and other sources as he investigates the death of his brother, Kenneth Michael Trentadue, at a federal prison in Oklahoma City just four months after the Oklahoma City bombing.  A Coverup That Won't Stay Covered  :  CNN recently reported that "the Justice Department is re-examining its investigation into the 1995 death of a federal prisoner that the victim's family alleges was murdered at the hands of the government."   Editor's Note:     I found this case interesting, and after doing a little searching on the internet for the name of the victim in this case, it appears that he might have been the elusive John Doe #2 in the Oklahoma City bombing investigation, or at least he may have known the identity of John Doe #2.  Reno closes Trentadue case; Senator Hatch opens it!    Fred B. Jordon, the Chief Medical Examiner (who examined the victims in the Murrah Building Explosion), reacted to the government's "case closed" statement with dismay, "Kenneth Trentadue died a violent and unusual death, the mechanism of which may never be satisfactorily explained."   In the matter of Kenneth Michael Trentadue  :  A five part series which seems to suggest that Mr. Trentadue was John Doe #2.  The Strange Case of Kenny Trentadue's Jail "Suicide"  .  William F. Jasper, Senior Editor of The New American, interviews attorney Jesse Trentadue, Kenny Trentadue's brother. In this four-part interview Jesse reveals how he was led reluctantly to the conclusion that his brother's death in jail was part of a government coverup of the truth about the Oklahoma City Bombing.  Oklahoma City bombing:  New evidence renews conspiracy debate  .  Kenneth Trentadue was no angel.  In the 1980s, he did time for robbing banks.  But in a strange twist, the circumstances behind his violent death 10 years ago in prison are playing out in federal court in a case that hints at a wider conspiracy in the Oklahoma City bombing.  Recently released documents unearthed because of a lawsuit against the FBI suggest that the long-standing allegations may not be so far-fetched.  The mysterious death of Kenneth Trentadue  .  "They (prison officials) thought we were going to get the body home and just have funeral services and that would be it.  They didn't think they were going to run into a strong family like this."  Another Suicide Or Another Cover-up?  .  Like everyone who is admitted into the prison system, Kenneth underwent routine psychological tests to determine if he had suicidal tendencies.  The results indicated he didn't.  Nevertheless, he was placed, for some unknown reason, in a specially designed, suicide-proof cell in a special unit on the seventh floor that's segregated from the general prison population. … On Aug. 21, 1995, Trentadue died in that isolation cell.  Officials promptly declared the death a suicide. … The following day the Inspector General's Office of the Justice Department ruled that no "prosecutable federal crime had occurred."  Two years later, that's still the official government line despite a staggering amount of evidence indicating Trentadue was murdered.  Uncovering a DOJ Coverup  .  In 1995 Kenneth Trentadue was murdered by federal agents in a federal prison in Oklahoma City.  A coverup immediately went into effect.  Federal authorities claimed Trentadue, who was being held in a suicide-proof cell, had committed suicide by hanging himself, but the state coroner would not buy the story. The Exploitation of Oklahoma City for Political Purposes  How Clinton exploited Oklahoma City for political gain  .  With the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing Monday, former President Bill Clinton is playing a starring role in the liberal effort to draw what the New York Times calls "parallels between the antigovernment tone that preceded that devastating attack and the political tumult of today."  The short version of the narrative is:  Today's Tea Partiers are tomorrow's right-wing bombers.  Bill Clinton Returns to the Scene of the Crime  .  The fifteenth anniversary of Timothy McVeigh's Oklahoma City bombing has just passed, and the Democrats are seizing every opportunity to wring political advantage out of that sorrowful event.  Bill Clinton appeared at a symposium on the bombing sponsored by a left-wing think tank and linked the mad bomber to today's opponents of the Democrats' radical agenda.  There He Gropes Again  .  [Scroll down]  Now just the other day, ex-President Bill Clinton — some of us still call him The Groper — rose up at the Center for American Progress, and drew parallels between the Tea Partiers (call them the Caffeinated Right) and the homicidal maniacs who participated in the Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 people and injuring hundreds more.  Clinton's charge was typically duplicitous. ... He also said, "Before the [Oklahoma] bombing occurred, there was a sort of fever in America," which I guess depends on the meaning of the word fever.  I recall no fever, but then I was not impeached for lying and obstruction of justice.  Could Tea Party Rhetoric Lead to Another Oklahoma City?    Former President Bill Clinton, among others, see echoes of the rhetoric that drove McVeigh in the current political discourse.  In an op-ed in the New York Times today [4/19/2010] tied to the bombing, he wrote that the bombers were driven by "the belief that the greatest threat to American freedom is our government, and that public servants do not protect our freedoms, but abuse them."  Clinton Rewrites History, Shifts Blame for Oklahoma City Bombing  .  [Scroll down]  Starting last Wednesday or Thursday into the weekend the media template was established, the narrative was there, Bill Clinton and Obama blaming the tea parties for a future Oklahoma City type bombing, which hasn't happened.  Let me ask you a question.  What was a more likely cause of the Oklahoma City bombing:  talk radio or Bill Clinton and Janet Reno's hands-on management of Waco, the Branch Davidian compound, and maybe to a lesser extent Ruby Ridge.  Don't forget that the Oklahoma City bombing occurred two years to the day after the Waco invasion, two years to the day, and Tim McVeigh as much as said so.  What's behind the anti-Tea Party hate narrative?    There's a new narrative taking hold in the wake of the recent Tea Party protests and the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing:  The Tea Partiers' intense opposition to the Obama administration has led to overheated political rhetoric, which could in turn lead to violence, perhaps as devastating as Oklahoma City.  Former President Clinton is the leading voice of this new narrative.  The Democrats' Big Disconnect  .  By the weekend, Bill Clinton and Rush Limbaugh were going after each other with bung starters and busted beer bottles.  Did anti-government rhetoric contribute to the Oklahoma City bombing of April 1995, which killed 168?  Yes!  No!  Guess which party to the discussion said which.  Jim Inhofe:  Bill Clinton comments 'unconscionable'  .  Former President Bill Clinton's comments surrounding the Oklahoma City bombing commemoration are "unconscionable" and an "over-the-top" effort to silence critics, Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) said Tuesday [4/20/2010].  Clinton has drawn fire for reprising criticism he made of conservative talk radio 15 years in the wake of the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building that took 168 lives and injured more than 500 others.  Using the Oklahoma City Bombing  .  Monday was the anniversary of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that left 149 men and women — most of them federal workers — and 19 children dead.  As is his habit, former President Bill Clinton used the occasion to bash his critics.  Clinton Plays the Oklahoma City Card  .  The Obama strategy of vilifying the tea party protesters and trying to link them to the violence of Oklahoma City is cynical and ridiculous.  The tea party protesters are, in many cases, decorated war veterans and can, in the main, only be described as patriots.  That Obama needs to paint them as violence prone extremists who are fanning flames that could lead to Oklahoma City-style bombings is offensive and vile in the extreme.  To Clinton, criticism is terrorism  .  Just as he did in 1995, [Bill] Clinton is again peddling the argument that a new wave of domestic terrorism is coming this time because millions of Tea Partying Americans have during the past year or more taken to the streets to protest, often loudly, many of the policies advanced by President Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the Democratic majority in Congress.  Democrats Hate That Tea Parties Are Peaceful  .  Former President Clinton reminds us, on the 15th anniversary of the bombing in Oklahoma City, to police our discourse so as not to incite the "delirious" and "unhinged." ... This is only the latest and most high profile installment of a long-running campaign by Democrats to malign their opposition.  It worked very well for Mr. Clinton in 1995 — the baseless insinuation that right-wing radio hosts had ignited murderous rage with their intemperate rhetoric — and he's reaching into that seedy toolbox again.  Criminalizing Debate  .  There is something terrifying to Democratic leaders about the flavor and the force of the Tea Party, so on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, they portrayed the group as a bunch of Timothy McVeighs.  The Violence Card  .  Liberal Democrats and their friends in the media have tried just about everything to dismiss and discredit the tea-party movement.  They've accused Americans who are anxious and angry about a rapidly encroaching government of being racists, extremists, birthers, pawns of a corporate "AstroTurf" effort — and, now, potential Timothy McVeighs.  Liberals and the Violence Card  .  Few presidents have sunk so low as Mr. Clinton did with his accusations about Oklahoma City.  Last week ... Mr. Clinton used the 15th anniversary of that horrific day to regurgitate his claims about talk radio. ...
