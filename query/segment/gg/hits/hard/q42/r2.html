<p>It was reported the van contained tonnes of explosives (<a 
href="http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2001/09/12/story23429.asp" target="_blank">14</a>).</p><p>What's 
really intriguing is that ABC's 20/20 (<a target="_blank" href="http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123885&page=1">15</a>), the New York Post (<a href="forget.html" target="_blank">16</a>), and the New Jersey 
Bergen Record (<a href="http://www.fpp.co.uk/online/01/12/WTC_Mysteries3.html" target="_blank">17</a>) all <i>
clearly and unambiguously </i>reported that a white van with Israelis was intercepted on a ramp near Route 3, 
which leads directly to the <i>Lincoln Tunnel.</i></p><p>But the Jerusalem Post, Israeli National News (Arutz 
Sheva) (<a href="forget.html" target="_blank">18</a>), and Yediot America, (<a 
href="http://www.gothamgazette.com/citizen/jan02/7.shtml" target="_blank">19</a>) all reported, <i>just as 
clearly and unambiguously</i>, that a white van with Israelis was stopped on a ramp leading to the <i>George 
Washington Bridge</i>, which is several miles north of the Lincoln Tunnel.</p><p>It appears as if there may 
actually have been two white vans involved, one stopped on each crossing. This would not only explain the 
conflicting reports as to the actual location of the arrests, but would also explain how so many credible 
eye-witnesses all saw celebrating &quot;middle-easterners&quot; in a white van in so many different locations. It also 
explains why the New York Post and Steve Gordon (lawyer for the 5 Israelis) originally described how three 
Israelis were arrested but later increased the total to five.</p><p>Perhaps one van was meant to drop off a 
bomb while the other was meant to pick up the first set of drivers while re-crossing back into New Jersey? If 
a van was to be used as a parked time-bomb on the GW Bridge, then certainly the drivers would need to have a 
&quot;get-away van&quot; to pick them up and escape. And notice how the van (or vans) stayed away from the third major 
crossing -the Holland Tunnel- which was where the police had originally been directed to by that 
anti-Palestinian 9-1-1 &quot;mystery caller&quot;. A classic misdirection play.</p><p>From there, the story gets becomes 
even more suspicious. The Israelis worked for a Weehawken moving company known as Urban Moving Systems.<font color="#000000" size="3"><b><i> </i></b></font>An American 
employee of Urban Moving Systems told the The Record of New Jersey that a majority of his co-workers were 
Israelis and they were joking about the attacks.</p><div align="center">

<p>A few days after the attacks, Urban Moving System's Israeli owner, Dominick Suter, dropped his business and 
fled the country for Israel. He was in such a hurry to flee America that some of Urban Moving System's 
customers were left with their furniture stranded in storage facilities (<a

<p align="left">The Jewish weekly The Forward reported that the FBI finally concluded that at least two of the

Systems, the ostensible employer of the five Israelis, was a front operation. This was confirmed by two former 
CIA officers, and they noted that movers' vans are a common intelligence cover. (<a target="_blank"

<tr>
<td>1. The Israeli &quot;movers&quot; cheered the 9-11 attacks to celebrate the successful accomplishment of the 
greatest spy operation ever pulled off in history.<p>2. One of them, or an accomplice, then calls a 9-1-1 
police dispatcher to report <i>Palestinian bomb-makers in a white van</i> headed for the Holland Tunnel. </p>
<p>3. Having thus pre-framed the Palestinians with this phone call, the Israeli bombers then head for the <i>
George Washington Bridge</i> instead, where they will drop off their time-bomb van and escape with Urban 
Moving accomplices.</p><p>4. But the police react very wisely and proactively by closing off <i>ALL</i> 
bridges and tunnels instead of just the Holland Tunnel. This move inadvertently foils the Israelis' 
misdirection play and leads to their own capture and 40 day torture.</p><p>5. To cover up this story, the U.S. 
Justice Department rounds up over 1000 Arabs for minor immigration violations and places them in New York area 
jails. The Israelis therefore become less conspicuous as the government and media can now claim that the 
Israelis were just immigration violators caught in the same dragnet as many other Arabs.</p><p>6. After 
several months, FBI and Justice Department &quot;higher-ups&quot; are able to gradually push aside the local FBI agents 
and free the Israelis quietly.</table></div>
<p>Osama bin Laden was immediately blamed for the 9/11 attacks even though he had no previous record of doing 
anything on this scale. Immediately after the Flight 11 hit World Trade Center 1<br>CIA Director George Tenet 
said &quot;You know, this has bin Laden's fingerprints all over it.&quot; (<a target="_blank" 
href="http://www.billstclair.com/911timeline/2002/abcnews091402.html">27</a>)</p><p>The compliant mainstream 
media completely ignored the Israeli connection. Immediately following the 9-11 attacks the media was filled 
with stories linking the attacks to bin Laden. TV talking-heads, &quot;experts&quot;, and scribblers of every stripe 
spoon-fed a gullible American public a steady diet of the most outrageous propaganda imaginable.</p><p>We were 
told that the reason bin Laden attacked the USA was because he hates our &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot;. The 
Muslims were &quot;medieval&quot; and they wanted to destroy us because they envied our wealth, were still bitter about 
the Crusades, and were offended by Britney Spears shaking her tits and ass all over the place!</p><p>But bin 
Laden strongly denied any role in the attacks and suggested that Zionists orchestrated the<br>9-11 attacks.
