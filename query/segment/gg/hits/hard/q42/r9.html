<!-- <b><font size="3">Introduction:</b></font><br><br> -->

Many important issues are handled very superficially by television news shows.&nbsp; If you're 
looking for details on important stories, you'll find that today's TV&nbsp;news is "all sizzle and no 
steak."&nbsp; That's because it's safer and easier and less expensive for TV news editors to tell you 
only the federal or state government's side of each story.&nbsp; (This is especially true if the government
is in possession of almost all the physical evidence.)&nbsp; It would take a lot of effort and expense to 
put conflicting viewpoints on television.&nbsp;  After all, a documentary is a lot of work.&nbsp; That's 
especially true with a controversial topic like the Oklahoma City bombing.&nbsp; The official explanation
of the Oklahoma City bombing, dispensed with no questions asked by the national news media, 
<!-- (and repeated verbatim by the local media)--> just doesn't add up.<br><br>

And there are a number of sidebar issues in this story that are just a little too suspicious.&nbsp; For 
example, the remains of the half-destroyed Federal building were demolished just a few weeks after the 
explosion.&nbsp; What was the rush?&nbsp; A crime scene of this importance is usually pored&nbsp;over for 
months after the incident.&nbsp; (People are still visiting the scene of the Kennedy assassination
every day, studying all the distances and angles.&nbsp; A substantial percentage of the people
roaming around Dealey Plaza do not believe the official lone-gunman explanation.)&nbsp;  So why was the 
Murrah Building leveled so quickly?<br><br>

This page gets a lot of hits.&nbsp; Apparently there are many people interested in 
this topic, for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; I suspect there are many people who 
distrust the national news media and the federal government as a result of the way 
this incident was reported.<br><br>

Juan Williams Link Christians to The Oklahoma City Bombing?</b></a>&nbsp; [Scroll down]&nbsp; Williams' premise 
is simply not correct.&nbsp; You see, Timothy McVeigh was not a "Christian terrorist."&nbsp; He was born of 
Christian parents and lived in a nominally Christian culture, sure, but he did not perpetrate his crime <i>in 
the name of the Christian God</i>.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Saudi terrorist <i>did kill thousands</i> in 
the name of their Muslim God.&nbsp; Thus, Williams' claim that we didn't hold McVeigh's crime against Christians
is a logical fallacy at the outset because McVeigh was neither representative of, nor claimed to be representing,
Christians, Christianity, nor a Christian God when he bombed the Murrah Federal Building in 1995.<br><br>

Official to Federal Judge: OKC Bombing Videotapes 'Might Have Been Misfiled'</b></a>.&nbsp; In a response 
filed yesterday to a federal judge's order May&nbsp;11, an FBI official offered no denials about the 
existence of video images captured by more than 20 surveillance cameras operating prior to 9:02&nbsp;a.m. on
April&nbsp;19, 1995, in the vicinity of the Alfred&nbsp;P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City.&nbsp;
Instead, he explained that officials at the bureau merely cannot find the tapes and raised the possibility
that they "might have been misfiled and thus could be located somewhere other than in the OKBOMB file 
(though it would be impossible to know where)."<br><br>

<a href="http://bobmccarty.com/2011/05/13/final-chapter-of-okc-bombing-not-yet-written/"><b>Final Chapter of 
OKC Bombing Not Yet Written</b></a>.&nbsp; Most members of the mainstream news media consider the investigation 
into the Oklahoma City Bombing closed and have, for the most part, stopped writing about it.&nbsp; And then 
there are people like me and Wes Vernon, a Washington, D.C.-based writer and veteran broadcast journalist 
who writes for Renew America.&nbsp; I think it's safe to say, both of us believe the final chapter about 
the bombing is yet to be written.<br><br>

<a href="http://www.koco.com/news/27595112/detail.html"><b>Families Observe Okla. City Bombing Anniversary</b></a>.&nbsp;
Sixteen years after a bomb destroyed the Oklahoma City federal building, survivors of the attack and family 
members of its 168 victims have gathered at the building's former site to observe the anniversary.<br><br>

<a href="http://www.aim.org/guest-column/oklahoma-city-bomber-threatened-within-prison-walls/"><b>Oklahoma 
City bomber threatened within prison walls?</b></a>&nbsp; Terry Nichols, serving life without parole in the
supermax prison ADX Florence in Colorado for his part in the Oklahoma City bombing (1995), says "John 
Doe&nbsp;2"&nbsp;&#8212; a mysterious accomplice in that terrorist act&nbsp;&#8212; does exist.&nbsp; Nichols 
has offered "not so subtle hints" of foreign complicity in the terror attack.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Hussain 
al-Hussaini&nbsp;&#8212; identified by multiple witnesses as "John Doe&nbsp;2" in the murderous attack that
killed 171 innocent people&nbsp;&#8212; is due for a hearing April&nbsp;26 in the Boston area, where he has
been jailed on unrelated mayhem charges.<br><br>
<!-- I predict his bond will be posted by a generous third party and then Mr. al-Hussaini will disappear again. -->

<a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/04/confession_of_the_oklahoma_cit.html"><b>Confession of the 
Oklahoma City Bomber: John Doe 2 Exists</b></a>.&nbsp; The conviction of American terrorists, Timothy 
McVeigh and Terry Nichols, symbolizes the FBI's crown jewel of criminal prosecutions.&nbsp; So why do 
questions linger?&nbsp; Does the official account of what transpired on April&nbsp;19, 1995 reveal all that 
certain federal investigators know?&nbsp; In the wake of the 1995 bombing, national polls showed 80&nbsp;percent 
of Americans believed additional conspirators evaded capture.&nbsp; Today, as the 16th anniversary approaches, 
the prospect of shadowy terrorists walking free still pervades the country's psyche.&nbsp; This time, 
however, the FBI itself is fueling the flames of public distrust.<br><br>

<a href="http://canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/34299"><b>"Homeless" Man Hussain Hashem al-Hussaini is 
"John Doe #2 in Oklahoma bombing</b></a>.&nbsp;  On Wednesday [3/9/2011], a "homeless man" was arrested 
in the Boston suburb of Quincy, Massachusetts, on a charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon 
after allegedly striking another man with a beer bottle.&nbsp; His name is Hussain Hashem al-HUSSAINI, 
although has several other aliases and a previous arrest record.&nbsp; His arrest would have likely gone 
unnoticed except for the tenacious investigative journalism conducted in the months and years following 
the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City by author and investigative journalist
Jayna Davis.<br><br>

police about two homeless men fighting.&nbsp; Hussain Al-Hussaini was arrested.&nbsp; The victim was taken 
to the hospital.&nbsp; Then came the surprise.&nbsp; Readers commenting on a story about Wednesday's 
arrest on The Patriot Ledger's website noted that a man with the same name was mentioned prominently in
a book about the deadly bombing of an Oklahoma City federal building in 1995.<br><br>

<a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-1678779-iraqis-linked-to-oklahoma-atrocity.do"><b>Iraqis 
linked to Oklahoma atrocity</b></a>.&nbsp; The FBI is under pressure from the highest political levels in 
Washington to investigate suspected links between Iraq and the Oklahoma bombing.&nbsp; Senior aides to US
Attorney-General John Ashcroft have been given compelling evidence that former Iraqi soldiers were directly
involved in the 1995 bombing that killed 185&nbsp;people.&nbsp; The methodically assembled dossier from
Jayna Davis, a former investigative TV reporter, could destroy the official version that white supremacists 
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were solely responsible for what, at the time, was the worst act of terrorism 
on American soil.<br><br>

the Oklahoma City bombing.&nbsp; During the past nine years, Jayna has compiled a comprehensive and compelling
investigative dossier, which unveils the Middle East's hand in the Oklahoma bombing.&nbsp; Her new book ... expertly

The article immediately above is a synopsis of 
a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Third-Terrorist-Connection-Oklahoma-Bombing/dp/1595552367/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1287402796&sr=8-1"><b>book</b></a> 
by <a href="http://www.jaynadavis.com/"><b>Jayna&nbsp;Davis</b></a> that comprises a great deal of reliable
information about the Oklahoma City bombing and the subsequent <i>cover-up</i>, frankly, of a number of
important loose ends in the government's investigation.&nbsp; I would like to believe that the fine folks 
at the FBI and BATF are merely following orders from higher up, but it certainly appears that the investigators
know about witnesses and evidence that they would prefer to suppress.&nbsp; The most astonishing aspect 
of this whole story is the malleability of the news media.&nbsp; At first the local TV stations were 
spreading an all points bulletin for John&nbsp;Doe&nbsp;#2, and before long they just dropped him down 
the memory hole, hoping nobody would notice.&nbsp; Jayna&nbsp;Davis, from KFOR-TV, is apparently the only 
reporter who didn't let the matter drop.&nbsp; As a result, she had a number of unpleasant experiences which
she relates in her book.&nbsp; If you have even a mild interest in the Oklahoma City story, I urge you 
to buy the book.<br><br>

Ed notes the Pentagon's decision yesterday to bar several military officials and intelligence analysts from 
testifying today before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing investigating whether the Able Danger program 
identified Mohamed Atta months before the 9/11 attacks.&nbsp; The Pentagon's decision to keep the witnesses
silent "only demonstrates that the program found something that the Pentagon still wants hidden," according
to the Captain.&nbsp; Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter is less unconcerned about the Pentagon's
action, saying his panel has already established the credibility of other witnesses who will testify at the

there were two explosions, based on eyewitness testimony.&nbsp; Why did this version of events disappear from

<a href="http://www.aim.org/aim-column/the-real-story-of-the-oklahoma-city-bombing/"><b>The Real Story of the 
Oklahoma City Bombing</b></a>.&nbsp; While liberal news outlets such as MSNBC were cynically exploiting the 
April&nbsp;19 anniversary of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing by attempting to tie the terrorist attack to the 
anti-government sentiments of the modern-day Tea Party movement, investigative reporter Jayna Davis was setting
the record straight in an exclusive interview on the AIM radio show, Take AIM.&nbsp; The Oklahoma City bombing
was an Arab/Muslim terrorist attack on the United States, she says.&nbsp; Davis, author of a blockbuster book 
on the attack, <i>The Third Terrorist</i>, has examined and presented the evidence showing that Oklahoma City 
bomber Timothy McVeigh was in fact a front man for Middle Eastern terrorists.&nbsp; The third terrorist, in 
addition to the two, McVeigh and Terry Nichols, who were convicted, was an Arab.&nbsp; This was the mysterious 
"John Doe" who was never found.<br><br>

<a href="http://www.aim.org/podcast/take-aim-jayna-davis-on-okc-third-terrorist/"><b>Podcast:&nbsp; Jayna Davis
on OKC Third Terrorist</b></a>.&nbsp; [Scroll down]&nbsp; The most incriminating testimony centers around just 
one man, who not only fit the FBI's physical description in the official arrest warrant for the infamous John Doe
Two, McVeigh's elusive accomplice, who was never captured, but according to Federal law enforcement officers this 
man, an Iraqi soldier known as Hussein Hashem al-Hussaini, was a dead ringer for the third profile sketch that
was issued for John Doe Two.&nbsp; Now witnesses identified Hussein al-Hussaini in the company of McVeigh.&nbsp;
He was, prior to the bombing, at a local bar; he was seated in the passenger seat of the Ryder truck that 
carried the bomb the morning of April&nbsp;19th; he was seen by a witness stepping out of that truck at ground
zero, right in front of the federal complex; he was seen speeding away from downtown seconds after the blast 
in a brown Chevrolet pickup.<br><br>

McVeigh, and Tainted History</b></a>.&nbsp; [Scroll down slowly]&nbsp;  To this day, the FBI has failed to 
investigate the multiple sightings of Iraqi Republican Guardsman Hussain Al-Hussaini in the presence of 
Timothy McVeigh prior to the bombing, exiting the bomb-laden Ryder truck the morning of April&nbsp;19, and 
escaping the ill-fated Murrah Building in a getaway vehicle pursued by the FBI in an all-points-bulletin 
issued for Middle Eastern terrorists.&nbsp; More significantly, two federal court rulings establish that this 
Iraqi soldier has no provable alibi for the morning of the bombing.&nbsp; The FBI never questioned Hussain 
Al-Hussaini and has refused repeated requests from Congress and the press to clear him officially of complicity 
in the Murrah Building bombing.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; It is my firm belief that Bill Clinton and Janet Reno should 
be called upon to answer that question.<br><br>

terrorists and at least one provable link to Iraq.&nbsp; This book, written by the relentless reporter who 
first broke the story of the Mideast connection, is filled with new revelations about the case and explains in
full detail the complete, and so far untold, story behind the failed investigation&nbsp;&#8212; why the FBI

Investigation</b></a>.&nbsp; A two-year congressional inquiry into the Oklahoma City bombing concludes that 
the FBI didn't fully investigate whether other suspects may have helped Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols 
with the deadly 1995 attack, allowing questions to linger a decade later.&nbsp; The House International 
Relations investigative subcommittee will release the findings of its two-year review as early as Wednesday, 
declaring there is no conclusive evidence of a foreign connection to the attack, but that far too many 
unanswered questions remain.<br><br>

<a href="http://www.devvy.com/briley/OKC_Bombing_Revelations.pdf"><b>The Oklahoma City Bombing Case Revelations</b></a>:&nbsp;
The OKC bombing was a failed federal sting operation that was, and still is, being covered up by federal officials and 
bureaucrats.&nbsp; Officials had prior warnings from domestic and Islamic terror groups and foreign governments including 
West Germany and Israel.&nbsp; But the officials also had their own prior warnings because of intelligence they had 
gathered from informants and provocateurs that U.S. government agencies had planted within the groups responsible for 
carrying out the OKC bombing.&nbsp; The government officials and agents involved are criminally and civilly liable 
because they did not have adequate fail-safes built in to warn the public or preempt the OKC bombing if things 
got out of control.<br><br>

<a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/OK/ok.html"><b>Were there additional explosive charges 
and additional bombers?</b></a>&nbsp; The minister who married my wife and I was in OK City right after the 
Murrah Building bomb(s) exploded, and he volunteered to help dig for survivors.&nbsp; He told of three very 
odd occurrences.&nbsp; In the first, he was required to show his ID six times before being allowed to help 
look for survivors.&nbsp; In the second, he confirmed the stories told by others that men in suits and ties 
were literally stepping over the wounded in their haste to gather up files and certain other items in the 
debris.&nbsp; Lastly, and the oddest story of all, he told of more men in suits and ties taping plastic 
sheeting over portions of the building wreckage!<br><br>

On Tuesday's show [4/19/2005] you heard FOX News' Rita Cosby talking about the quite shocking claims made by a 
group of victims' families that Iraq was at the bottom of the Alfred&nbsp;P. Murrah Federal Building bombing 
in Oklahoma City.&nbsp; This has come up before: A reporter named Jayna Davis has a book out about it.<br><br>

<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/yates/yates33.html"><b>A Morass of Unanswered Questions</b></a>.&nbsp; 
[Scroll down]&nbsp; The problem is that the official account of what happened in Oklahoma City on April&nbsp;19, 
1995, has more holes than Swiss cheese.&nbsp; Every independent investigation I am aware of has concluded that 
others besides Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were involved, though they diverge on the details.&nbsp; Some 
pick up on obscure remarks in McVeigh's recent letter to Fox News as pointing to a connection between the 
bombing and the leading terrorist Osama bin Laden, suggesting that Terry Nichols met with bin Laden's agents 
in the Phillipines two months earlier to help plan the bombing.&nbsp; Jayna Davis, an NBC reporter in Oklahoma
City, claimed to have turned up evidence that McVeigh was involved with Iraqi immigrants.<br><br>

swung to the other extreme, dismissing such early speculation as the result of ethnic and religious

trickle increased to a flood in the wake of the September&nbsp;11 attack on
