<h2>THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMB: 
<br>
Who is Ramzi Yousef? And Why It Matters</h2>
<P>
by Laurie Mylroie
<P>
ACCORDING TO THE presiding judge in last year's trial, the bombing
of New York's World Trade Center on February 26, 1993 was meant
to topple the city's tallest tower onto its twin, amid a cloud
of cyanide gas.  Had the attack gone as planned, tens of thousands
of Americans would have died.  Instead, as we know, one tower
did not fall on the other, and, rather than vaporizing, the cyanide
gas burnt up in the heat of the explosion. &quot;Only&quot; six
people died.
<P>
   Few Americans are aware of the true scale of the destructive
ambition behind that bomb, this despite the fact that two years
later, the key figure responsible for building it--a man who had
entered the United Stares on an Iraqi passport under the name
of Ramzi Yousef--was involved in another stupendous bombing conspiracy.
 In January 1995, Yousef and his associates plotted to blow up
eleven U.S. commercial aircraft in one spectacular day of terrorist
rage. The bombs were to be made of a liquid explosive designed
to pass through airport metal detectors. But while mixing his
chemical brew in a Manila apartment, Yousef started a fire.  He
was forced to flee, leaving behind a computer that contained the
information that led to his arrest a month later in Pakistan.
 Among the items found in his possession was a letter threatening
Filipino interests if a comrade held in custody were not released.
 It claimed the &quot;ability to make and use chemicals and poisonous
gas... for use against vital institutions and residential populations
and the sources of drinking water.&quot; [1]   Quickly extradited,
he is now in U.S. custody awaiting trial this spring.
<P>
   Ramzi Yousef's plots were the most ambitious terrorist conspiracies
ever attempted against the United States.  But who is he?   Is
he a free-lance bomber?  A deranged but highly-skilled veteran
of the Muslim jihad against the Soviets in Afghanistan?   Is he
an Arab, or of some other Middle Eastern ethnicity?  Is there
an organization--perhaps even a state--behind his work?
<P>
   These questions have an obvious bearing not only on past events
but on possible future ones as well. [2]  It is important to know
who Ramzi Yousef is and who his &quot;friends&quot; are, because
if he is not just a bomber-for-hire, or an Islamic militant loosely
connected to other Muslim fundamentalists, Yousef's &quot;friends&quot;
could still prove very dangerous to the United States.  It is
of considerable interest, therefore, that a very persuasive case
can be made that Ramzi Yousef is an Iraqi intelligence agent,
and that his bombing conspiracies were meant as Saddam Hussein's
revenge for the Gulf War.  If so, and if, as U.S. officials strongly
suspect, Baghdad still secretly possesses biological warfare agents,
then we may still not have heard the last from Saddam Hussein.
<P>
   This essay will focus on three points.  First, it will argue
that, as things stand now, coordination between  the  Justice
Department and the relevant national security agencies is such
that the latter--and thus national security itself gets very short
shrift when it comes to dealing with terror incidents perpetrated
on U.S. soil.  Second, it will look afresh at the evidence from
the World Trade Center bombing case and suggest that the most
logical explanation of the evidence points to Iraqi state sponsorship.
Third, it will assay briefly what dangers the Iraqi regime may
still pose to the United States should this analysis prove correct.
<P>
<h3>A High Wall</h3>
<P>
THE SUGGESTION THAT Iraq might well have been behind Ramzi Yousef's
exploits may initially strike many as implausible.  Wouldn't the
U.S. government investigation of the World Trade Center bombing
have uncovered evidence to that effect, evidence that the press,
in turn, would have broadcast far and wide?  Wouldn't America's
robust anti-terrorist intelligence capacities have focused on
such suspicions long ago?
<P>
   While these are reasonable questions, they reveal a lack of
understanding about how the U.S. government works when legal and
national security issues of this special sort overlap.   A high
wall, in fact, stands between the Justice Department, including
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on the one hand, and the
national security agencies on the other. Once arrests are made,
the trials of individual perpetrators take bureaucratic precedence
over everything else.  The Justice Department inherits primary
investigatory jurisdiction, and the business of the Justice Department
is above all the prosecution and conviction of individual criminals.
 Once that process is underway, the Justice Department typically
denies information to the national security bureaucracies, taking
the position that passing on information might &quot;taint the
evidence&quot; and affect prospects for obtaining convictions.
[3]
<P>
   In effect, the Justice Department puts the prosecution of individual
perpetrators--with all the rights to a fair trial guaranteed by
the U.S. judicial system--above America's national security interest
in determining who may be behind terrorist attacks.  Questions
of state sponsorship that are of pressing interest to national
security agencies are typically relegated to a distant second
place, or never properly addressed at all, because the national
security agencies are denied critical information.  In particular,
whenever early arrests are made regarding a terrorist incident
on American soil, the U.S. government cannot properly address
both the national security question of state sponsorship and the
criminal question of the guilt or innocence of individual perpetrators
at the same time.
<P>
   This is precisely what happened in the World Trade Center bombing.
 In the case of Ramzi Yousef, the perfectly reasonable questions
posed above about who this man is and who may sponsor him have
never been properly investigated.  Instead of the appropriately
trained people conducting a comprehensive investigation, the World
Trade Center bombing was followed by an undercover operation,
in which an informant of dubious provenance led a handful of local
Muslims in a new bombing conspiracy, aimed at the United Nations
and other New York landmarks.  For this conspiracy Sheikh Omar
Abdul Rahman and nine others were found guilty in early October
1995.  Yet none of those in the trial of Sheikh Omar et al., as
it is formally called, was accused of actually participating in
the World Trade Center bombing.[4]  They were only charged with
conspiracy regarding it.  The government contended that other
followers of Sheikh Omar--four fundamentalists who stood trial
in 1994--were actually responsible for puffing it into effect.
<P>
   But what if Ramzi Yousef, who eluded the grasp of U.S. authorities
until after his second bombing conspiracy, is neither a follower
of Sheikh Omar nor a Muslim fundamentalist?  That if he is an
Iraqi agent?  From a legal perspective--as the judge in that trial
advised the defense team--whether state sponsorship played a role
in the World Trade Center bombing was irrelevant to the guilt
or innocence of Sheikh Omar et al.  And indeed, the prosecution
did not need to address the question of whether the World Trade
Center bombing had state sponsorship in order to obtain the convictions
sought against Sheikh Omar and the others.
<P>
   Indeed, that state sponsorship can be irrelevant to a criminal
prosecution was explained most clearly by the federal prosecutors
in the New York bombing conspiracies, the lead prosecutor in the
trial of Sheikh Omar et al., and the lead prosecutor in last year's
Trade Center bombing trial, who will also prosecute Ramzi Yousef.
 When I put it to them that Iraq was probably behind the Trade
Center bombing, they replied, &quot;You may be right, but we don't
do state sponsorship. We prosecute individuals.&quot; Asked who
does &quot;do&quot; state  sponsorship,  they  answered, &quot;Washington.&quot;
&quot;Who in Washington?&quot; No one seemed to know.[6]
<P>
   Yet by responding to state-sponsored terrorism solely by arresting
and trying individual perpetrators, the U.S. government, in effect,
invites such states to commit acts of terror in such a way as
to leave behind a few relatively minor figures to be arrested,
tried, and convicted.  Done adroitly, this makes it unlikely that
the larger, more important, and more difficult question of state
sponsorship will ever be addressed.
<P>
   The problem is illustrated vividly in the case of Ramzi Yousef
since his arrest in February 1995.  The Justice Department has
passed on very little information to other bureaucracies.  The
FBI's typical response to any question about Yousef is: &quot;We
can't tell you much because of the trial.&quot; [7]  As a result,
the State Department, which is responsible for determining whether
a terrorist act had state sponsorship, lacks the most basic information--
even, for example, a point as simple as what passport Yousef was
traveling on when he was arrested in Islamabad.
<P>
   The details of the World Trade Center case are chilling.  
From the outset, the Justice Department refused to share key information
with the national security agencies.  The government had two sets
of relevant information--foreign intelligence, gathered by the
CIA from watching terrorist states such as Iran and Iraq, and
evidence gathered by the FBI largely within the United Stares
for use in the trial. The FBI flatly told the national security
bureaucracies that there was &quot;no evidence&quot; of state
sponsorship in the World Trade Center bombing.  When the national
security agencies asked to see the evidence themselves, the FBI
replied, &quot;No, this is a criminal matter. We're handling it.&quot;
Thus, all that the national security agencies had available to
decide the question of state sponsorship was foreign intelligence
they themselves had collected.
<P>
   But many cases of stare-sponsored terrorism cannot be cracked
by means of intelligence alone. The crucial element linking the
bombing of Pan Am flight 103 to Libya, for example, was not intelligence
but a piece of physical evidence--a microchip, part of the bomb's
timing device, that could be tied to other bombs built by Libyan
agents.
<P>
   After the World Trade Center bombing, the FBI was the only
bureaucracy with both the intelligence and the evidence. Even
if the FBI did make a serious effort to examine the evidence for
state sponsorship--and it is not clear that it did--the Bureau
alone is not competent to carry out such an investigation. &quot;They're
head hunters&quot;, one official in Pentagon Counterterrorism
remarked--that is, they are oriented to the arrest of individuals.
 A State Department expert described the FBI's new Office of Radical
Fundamentalism as &quot;a joke&quot;, bereft of any genuine Middle
East expertise.
<P>
   But the more fundamental problem is that the Justice Department
in Washington seems not to have been interested in pursuing the
question of state sponsorship.  In fact, the New York FBI office
suspected an Iraqi connection early on, but the Washington brass
seemingly wanted to tell America that they had already cracked
the case and caught most of the perpetrators.  It is always easier
to go after the small fry than to catch the big fish, and law
enforcement is ever vulnerable to the temptation to cut off a
conspiracy investigation at the most convenient point.
<P>
   Thus, five weeks after the World Trade Center bombing, four
 Arabs were under arrest. The mastermind, Ramzi Yousef, had fled.
 Still, at that point in early April 1993, the FBI proclaimed
that it had captured most of those involved. The bombing, it claimed,
was the work of a loose group of fundamentalists with no ties
to any state.  The predictable media frenzy followed and, perhaps
as a result, some obvious questions were not asked.  How could
the government know so early in the investigation that those it
had arrested had no ties to any state?  If the government knew
so much so soon, then why did one of those arrested never stand
trial for the bombing, and why were three others indicted much
later?  In short, the Justice Department determined that the bombing
had no state sponsorship even before it decided definitively who
had been involved.
<P>
   Moreover, by April it was impossible to have conducted a sufficiently
thorough investigation.  Such an investigation required, at a
minimum, a meticulous examination of all records associated with
the defendants to insure that they had had no contact with foreign
intelligence agencies--or at least that none could be found. 
That process simply could not have been accomplished in five weeks.
 And it must be kept in mind that, at the time, the mastermind
of the bomb was a fugitive about whom almost nothing was known.
 How could anyone therefore declare confidently that he was not
a foreign agent, especially in light of the fact that he had entered
the United States on an Iraqi passport and had been known among
the New York fundamentalists as &quot;Rashid, the Iraqi&quot;?
<P>
   Ironically, this sort of problem would not have arisen had
the bombing occurred abroad.  In such cases there are usually
two separate investigations by two different bureaucracies, one
to determine state sponsorship, the other to catch the individuals
responsible.  After the bombing of Pan Am 103, for example, the
CLA led an inter-agency intelligence investigation addressing
the question of state sponsorship.  There was also a separate
criminal investigation, headed by the FBI, aimed at individual
perpetrators.
<P>
   But there was no intelligence investigation of the World Trade
Center bombing.  The CIA is, after all, prohibited from operating
in America.  Of course, a crack inter-agency team could have been
established to examine the question of state sponsorship.  But
Clinton administration officials set up no such team.
<P>
   In  September  1995,  the  State Department forwarded to Congress
the report of an independent panel, established to examine whether
mistakes in security training had contributed to the March 8 assassination
of two U.S. consular officials in Karachi--apparent retaliation
for Ramzi Yousef's extradition. The report expressed concern about
the FBI's lack of cooperation with the national security agencies.
 Clearly, discontent with the FBI is growing among those agencies
as issues such as international crime--and with them the Bureau's
international role--assume a mare prominent role in the post-Cold
War world.  Indeed, one State Department official described the
FBI'S unwillingness to share information as &quot;the train wreck
coming&quot;--meaning that given the FBI's lack of expertise in
international politics, there may well come a time when the Bureau
will be sitting on information that, in the hands of others, could
have been used to avert a disaster.
<P>
   One may indeed ask whether the World Trade Center bombing itself
is not a harbinger of the train wreck coming.  For if Saddam Hussein
was behind it, then the Justice Department, in effect, has blinded
the national security bureaucracies to a serious danger, namely
the possibility that in the extreme Iraq might use biological
agents, whether for terrorism in America or in the context of
military' action in the region, possibly involving U.S. troops.
<P>
   Of course, that is an important &quot;if.&quot;  It is to that
issue we now turn.
<P>

<P>
<h3>Forty-Six Calls to Iraq</h3>
<P>
ALTHOUGH THE national security agencies never received the World
Trade Center evidence, at the conclusion of a trial evidence becomes
public.  Anyone can examine it, and I did so meticulously.  The
raw data consist mostly of telephone records, passports, and airplane
tickets.  Such data reveal nothing directly about state sponsorship,
but under close analysis certain facts begin to stand out and
certain patterns emerge. And it helps to know the Middle East
well.
<P>
   The story begins in November 1990 when an Egyptian fundamentalist,
El Sayid Nosair, shot and killed Meir Kahane, an extreme right-wing
Israeli-American, in Manhattan.  A year later, in November 1991,
Nosair's trial became a cause celebre among local fundamentalists,
who turned out in force to support their &quot;martyr.&quot; 
Planted among them was an Egyptian, Emad Salem, working as an
FBI informant, even as he maintained ties to Egyptian intelligence.
 In December, the jury returned a bizarre verdict, acquitting
Nosair of murder and finding him guilty on lesser charges.  An
outraged judge gave Nosair a maximum sentence on those lesser
charges, and sent him to Attica.
<P>
   The fundamentalists continued to support Nosair, arranging
bus trips from their mosques to visit him in prison. Salem, the
FBI plant, remained among them.  In early June 1992, with Salem
acting as an agent provocateur, Nosair convinced his friends to
execute a bomb plot.  He wanted them to make twelve pipe bombs,
to be used for assassinating his judge and a Brooklyn assemblyman,
the others to be used against Jewish targets.  A cousin was to
organize the plot, and Salem was to build the bombs.
<P>
   A twenty-six year old Palestinian, Mohammad Salameh, was soon
recruited into the plot.  Salameh comes from a long line of terrorists
on his mother's side. His maternal grandfather fought in the 1936
Arab revolt against British rule in Palestine, and even as an
old man joined the PLO and managed to get himself jailed by the
Israelis.  A maternal uncle was arrested in 1968 for terrorism
and served eighteen years in an Israeli prison before he was released
and deported, making his way to Baghdad where he became number
two in the &quot;Western Sector&quot;, a PLO terrorist unit under
Iraqi influence.
<P>
   Despite this pedigree, Salameh himself is naive and manipulable.
 When one considers that he was arrested in the process of returning
to collect the deposit on the van he had rented to carry the Trade
Center bomb, it is not so surprising that on June 10, soon after
being recruited into Nosair's plot, Salameh made the first of
forty-six calls to Iraq, the vast majority to his terrorist uncle
in Baghdad.  We can only speculate about what Salameh told his
uncle, but it seems very likely that he spoke about the bold new
project Nosair was organizing, perhaps seeking his help and advice.
 Salameh's telephone bills suggest that the pipe bombing plot
was one of the most exciting events in his life:  In six weeks
he ran up a bill of over four thousand dollars and lost his phone
service.
<P>
    Iraq is one of the few remaining Stalinist states.  Iraqis
routinely assume their telephones are bugged, and are even cautious
about discussing sensitive issues in their own homes.   The more
significant the person, the greater the likelihood his activities
are monitored--at least that is what Baghdadis assume.  My own
experience in Baghdad makes clear that when Iraqis want to be
sure that a conversation is not monitored, it takes place out
of doors.  It is thus more than likely that Iraqi intelligence
learned of Nosair's bombing plot and Salameh's participation in
it through Salameh's phone calls to his uncle. In any event, key
preparatory steps to the World Trade Center bombing were taken
within days of Salameh's first call-including steps taken in Baghdad.
<P>
    On June 21, an Iraqi living in Baghdad, Abdul Rahman Yasin
(subsequently an indicted fugitive in the Trade Center bombing)
appeared at the U.S. embassy in Amman asking for a U.S. passport.
 Born in America, Abdul Rahman received his passport, which he
soon used to travel to this country.
<P>
   Just at this crucial point, unfortunately, the FBI lost track
of the Nosair-Salameh conspiracy.  It did not fully trust its
informant, Emad Salem, and Salem's ties to Egyptian intelligence;
the Bureau severed relations with him in early July when he refused
to follow its procedures relating to criminal investigations.
<P>
   Salameh's phone bills and other evidence raise the distinct
possibility that, Iraqi intelligence having learned of Nosair's
plans from Salameh's calls to his uncle, Baghdad decided to help
out, transforming the plot in the process. If so, the speed of
the reaction suggests that Iraqi intelligence may have already
been planning some operation against America, and that Salameh1s
calls to his uncle provided it with a fortuitous means of carrying
it out. Here probably lies the source of Ramzi Yousef s exploits
in America.
<P>
<h3>Enter Ramzi Yousef</h3>
<P>
ON SEPTEMBER 1, 1992, Ramzi Yousef arrived at JFK airport.  He
presented an Iraqi passport without a U.S. visa, was briefly detained
(and fingerprinted) for illegal entry, and granted asylum pending
a hearing.  Yousef went to stay at the apartment of Musab Yasin,
an Iraqi living in Jersey City.  So too did Abdul Rahman Yasin,
Musab's younger brother, who arrived in America from Iraq soon
after Yousef.  (Musab had an unlisted telephone number under an
Israeli-sounding alias, Josie Hadas.)
<P>
   Musab lived in the same building as Mohammad Salameh.  Many
young Arab men used their two apartments, praying and eating together;
relations were so close that the apartments were connected by
an intercom. Once established within this group, Ramzi Yousef
befriended Salameh, and the two left to share an apartment elsewhere
in Jersey City.  From then on, the impressionable Salameh was
under Yousef s  wing.
<P>
   Although the principal conspirators had been in place since
September, it was not until after the U.S. elections on November
3 that Yousef began to prepare the World Trade Center bomb.  In
mid-November the first of many calls to chemical companies appears
on his phone bills.  At the same time, Yousef also began calling
surgical supply companies for the gloves, masks, and rubber tubing
he needed to make the bomb.  In the meantime, two other local
fundamentalists were recruited into the plot, Nidal Ayyad and
Mahmud Abu Halima.  Ayyad, a Palestinian, was the same age as
Salameh and Salameh's friend.  Abu Halima, a thirty-four year
old Egyptian cab driver, was a friend of Nosair.  Abu Halima was
older and generally savvier than the two Palestinians.
<P>
   In January 1993, Yousef and Salameh moved into another Jersey
City apartment where the bomb was actually built.  Set well back
from the street, the building provided seclusion.  On February
21  a twenty-one year old Palestinian named Eyyad Ismail arrived
from Dallas.  Ismail is charged with having driven the bomb-laden
van.[8] On February 23, Salameh went to a Ryder rental agency
to rent the van to carry the bomb.  On the morning of February
26, the conspirators gathered at a local Shell gas station where
they topped up the tank--one last explosive touch--before driving
to Manhattan.  Shortly after noon, the bomb went off, on--let
it be well noted--the second anniversary of the ending of the
Gulf War.
<P>
   That evening Salameh drove Yousef and Ismail to JFK airport;
Yousef escaped to Pakistan on falsified travel documents, and
Ismail flew home to Jordan.  But Salameh looks to have been deliberately
left behind by Yousef, not provided with money he needed for a
plane ticket.  Salameh had a ticket to Amsterdam on Royal Jordanian
fight 262, which continues on to Amman, dated for March 5, but
it was an infant ticket that had cost him only $65. While Salameh
had been able to use this ticket to get himself a Dutch visa,
he could not actually travel on it Needing more money for an adult
fare, he tried to get his van deposit back by telling the rental
agency that the van had been stolen. With either desperate or
inane persistence, he returned three times before he was finally
arrested on March 4.
<P>
   Salameh had used Musab Yasin's phone number when renting the
van, and Abdul Rahman Yasin was picked up the same day in a sweep
of sites associated with Salameh.  Abdul Rahman was taken to New
Jersey FBI headquarters in Newark.  He is reported to have been
extremely cool, as a trained intelligence agent would be. He was
helpful to investigators who themselves faced tremendous pressure
to produce answers.  He told them, for instance, the location
of the apartment that was used to make the bomb, a key bit of
information.  They thanked him for his cooperation and let him
walk out.  This, although he had arrived just six months before
from Iraq, and might well attempt to return there.  And indeed,
the very next day, Abdul Rahman Yasin boarded Royal Jordanian
262 to Amman, the same plane Salameh had hoped to catch.  From
Amman he went on to Baghdad.  An ABC news stringer saw him there
last year, outside his father's house, and learned from neighbors
that he worked for the Iraqi government.
<P>
   Meanwhile, as U.S. authorities searched for Abdul Rahman Yasin
in March 1993, after his &quot;helpful&quot; session with the
FBI and before they knew for certain that he had fled, an FBI
agent who had worked with Emad Salem in June 1992 speculated:
<P>
   &quot;Do you ever think that Iraqi intelligence might have
known of these people who were willing to do something crazy,
and that Iraqi intelligence found them out and encouraged them
to do this as a retaliation for the bombing of Iraq. . . . So
the people who are left holding the bag here in America are Egyptian.
.  . or Palestinian. . . . But the other people we are looking
for, Abdul Rahman, he is gone.   . I hate to think what's going
to happen if this guy turns out to be. . an Iraqi intelligence
operative...and these people were used.&quot; [9]
<P>
   Mahmud Abu Halima had similar thoughts.  As he told a prison
companion who later turned state's evidence:
<P>
&quot;The planned act was not as big as what subsequently occurred.
. .  Yousef showed up on the scene.  and escalated the initial
plot. . . .  Yousef used [them]. . .as pawns and then immediately
after the blast left the country.&quot; [10]
<P>
That, indeed, is the most straightforward explanation of the World
Trade Center bombing: that it was an Iraqi intelligence operation,
led by Ramzi Yousef, with the local fundamentalists serving first
as aides and then as diversionary dupes.
<P>
   Since Yousef's arrest and extradition to the United States,
the evidence for this explanation has, if anything, grown stronger.
 First of all, he is clearly no fundamentalist.  According to
neighbors, he had a Filipina girlfriend and enjoyed Manila's raucous
night life.[11]  Yousef's nationality and ethnicity have also
become known: He is a Pakistani Baluch.
<P>
   The Baluch are a distinct ethnic group, speaking their own
language, one of several Middle Eastern peoples without their
own homeland.  They live in eastern Iran and western Pakistan
in inhospitable desert terrain over which neither Tehran nor Islamabad
exercises much control. Baluchistan is a haven for smuggling,
both of drugs and of arms. The Baluch are Sunni and are at sharp
odds with Tehran's Shia clerical regime. Through Iraq's many years
of conflict with Iran, first in the early 1970s and then during
the Iran-Iraq war a decade later, Iraqi intelligence developed
close ties with the Baluch on both sides of the Iranian-Pakistani
border.  Above all, it used them to carry out terrorism against
Iran.
<P>
    Yousef's associates in Pakistan, too, were anti-Shia. This
fact, taken together with his Baluch ethnicity, make it nearly
impossible that Iran could be behind Yousef.  The most recent
inquiries, made since Yousef's arrest, have reduced the question
to two possibilities: He is a free-lancer connected to a loose
network of fundamentalists; or he worked for Iraq. [12]
<P>
<h3>Of Passports and Fingerprints</h3>
<P>
THE SINGLE MOST important piece of evidence pointing to Iraq is
the passport on which Yousef fled America.  It was no ordinary
passport.
<P>
  On November 9,1992, just after the final green light for the
bombing had been given, Yousef reported to Jersey City., police
that he had lost his passport.  He claimed to be Abdul Basit Mahmud
Abdul Karim, a Pakistani born and reared in Kuwait.  Then, between
December 3 and December 27, Yousef made a number of calls to Baluchistan.
 Several of them were conference calls to a few key numbers, a
geographical plotting of which suggests that they were related
to Yousef's probable escape route--through Pakistani and Iranian
Baluchistan--across the Arabian Sea to Oman, after which the &quot;telephone
trail&quot; ends.  After Yousef s  arrest, a National Security
Council staffer confirmed to me that Yousef had indeed fled from
the United States through Baluchistan.
<P>
On December 31, 1992, Yousef went to the Pakistani consulate in
New York with photocopies of Abdul Basit's current and previous
passports.  Consistent with his story to police in Jersey City,
he claimed to have lost his passport and asked for a new one.
 The consulate suspected his non-original documentation enough
to deny him a new passport.  But it did provide him a six-month,
temporary passport and told him to straighten things out when
he returned &quot;home.&quot; This turned out to be good enough
for the purpose at hand.
<P>
   By now it should be clear that the World Trade Center bomber's
real name is probably neither Ramzi Yousef nor Abdul Basit.  After
all, would someone intending to blow up New York's tallest tower
go to such trouble to get a passport under his own name? Yousef
was a man of many passports; he had three on his person when he
was arrested in Pakistan.  Rather, it seems that Ramzi Yousef
risked going to the Pakistani consulate with such flimsy documents
because he wanted investigators to conclude that he was in fact
Abdul Basit, and so would stop trying to determine his real identity.
 And that is pretty much what happened.
<P>
   But why Abdul Basit Karim? Here we come to one of the most
intriguing and vital aspects of the case.  Because there really
was an Abdul Basit Karim, a Pakistani born in Kuwait, who later
attended Swansea Institute, a technical school in Wales.  After
graduating in 1989 with a two-year degree in computer-aided electronic
engineering, he returned to a job in Kuwait's planning ministry.
 As Abdul Basit and his family were permanent residents of Kuwait,
Kuwait's Interior Ministry maintained files on them.  But the
files for Abdul Basit and his parents in Kuwait's Interior Ministry
have been tampered with.  Key documents from the Kuwaiti files
on Abdul Basit and his parents are missing.  There should be copies
of the front pages of the passports, including a picture, a notation
of  height, and so forth, but that material is gone. There is
also information in the file that should not be there, especially
a notation stating that Abdul Basit and his family left Kuwait
for Iraq on August 26, 1990, transiting to Iran at Salamchah (a
crossing point near Basra) on their way to Pakistani Baluchistan,
where, according to the file, they now live.
<P>
   Who put that notation into Abdul Basit's file and why?  Consider
the circumstances of the moment.  The Kuwaiti government had ceased
to exist, and Iraq was an occupation authority; bent on establishing
control over a hostile population amid near-universal condemnation,
as an American-led coalition threatened war.  The situation was
chaotic as hundreds of thousands of people were fleeing for their
lives.  While the citizens of Western countries were pawns in
a high stakes game, held hostage by Iraq, little attention was
paid to the multitude of Third World nationals bent on escape.
 It truly boggles the imagination to believe that under such circumstances
an Iraqi bureaucrat was sitting calmly in Kuwait's Interior Ministry
taking down the flight plans--including the itinerary and final
destination--of otherwise non-descript Baluchis fleeing Kuwait.
 Rather, it looks as if Iraqi intelligence put that information
into Abdul Basit's file to make it appear that he left Kuwait
rather than died there, and that, like Ramzi Yousef, he too was
Baluch.
<P>
   Moreover, Iraqi intelligence apparently switched fingerprint
cards, removing the original with Abdul Basit's fingerprints and
replacing it with one bearing those of Yousef.  Fingerprints are
decisive for investigators because no two people's match.  But
the very fact that fingerprints are so decisive makes them the
perfect candidate for careful manipulation. Thus, after U.S. authorities
learned that Yousef had fled as Abdul Basit, they sent his fingerprints
(taken by the Immigration and Naturalization Service at JFF airport
when he was briefly detained for illegal entry) to Kuwait, asking
if they matched those of Abdul Basit.  When the Kuwaitis said
that they did, everyone assumed the question settled--forgetting
that Kuwait's files were not secure during the Iraqi occupation.
<P>
Pakistan also maintains files on those of its citizens permanently
resident abroad, at the embassy in the country in which they live.
 On August 9, Baghdad ordered all embassies in Iraq's &quot;nineteenth
province&quot; to close.  Most did, including the Pakistani embassy.
 The files on Abdul Basit and his family that should be in the
Pakistani embassy in Kuwait are missing.  The Pakistani government
now has no record of the family.
<P>
   What does all this suggest?  To me it suggests that Abdul Basit
and his family were in Kuwait when Iraq invaded in August 1990;
that they probably died then; and that Iraqi intelligence then
tampered with their files to create an alternative identity for
Ramzi Yousef. Clearly, only Iraq could reasonably have: 1) known
of, or caused, the death of Abdul Basit and his family; 2) tampered
with Kuwait's Interior Ministry files, above all switching the
fingerprint cards; and 3) filched the files on Abdul Basit and
his family from the Pakistani embassy in Kuwait.
<P>
   Of course, the best way to verify or falsify this would be
to check with people who knew Abdul Basit before August 1990.
 To this end, Brad White, a former Senate Judiciary Committee
investigator and CBS newsman, contacted an overseas source he
knew in the United Kingdom who had looked into the matter.  Two
people had a good memory of Abdul Basit but, shown photos of Yousef,
were unable to make a positive identification.  They both felt
that while there was some similarity in looks, it was not the
same person. &quot;Our feeling is that Ramzi Yousef is probably
not Basit&quot;, White was told.[13]
<P>
    Logic and circumstance also suggest the same conclusion. 
Is it likely to be mere coincidence, after all, that during Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait key documents were removed from Abdul Basit's
and his parents files, while the same files were filched in their
entirety from the Pakistani embassy?  Moreover, Abdul Basit had
no criminal record in Britain, nor did he or his parents have
any security record in Kuwait.  The first concrete knowledge we
have of Ramzi Yousef/Abdul Basit comes in early 1991, around the
end of the Gulf war when he showed up in the Philippines seeking
contact with a Muslim group there.  Introduced as &quot;the chemist&quot;,
he proposed to collaborate in
<P>
bombing conspiracies.  Now, how did a young man who had led a
seemingly normal life up until August 1990 suddenly become a world
class terrorist six months after Iraq invaded his country of residence?
 Where did he get such sophisticated explosives training in just
six months?  (The real Abdul Basit's degree, remember, was in
electronic engineering, not chemistry, which Swansea Institute
does not even teach.)
<P>
   And where are Abdul Basit's parents?  They never returned to
Kuwait after its liberation, nor have they appeared anywhere else.
 Did they too take up a life of crime after decades of abiding
by the law?
<P>
     Ramzi Yousef's arrest has made it easy enough to resolve
a key question and perhaps produce important evidence implicating
Iraq in the World Trade Center bombing: Is &quot;Ramzi Yousef&quot;
really Abdul Basit or not?  Let those who remember Abdul Basit
from before August 1990 meet Yousef in person and tell us.  It
sounds simple and logical, but strangely, the Justice Department
has shown no interest in arranging such a meeting.  Moreover,
it has decided to try, the bomber as Ramzi Yousef even though
no one, including Yousef by now, maintains that that is his real
name.  If the government believes that Yousef is really Abdul
Basit, why doesn't it try him as Abdul Basit?  Why is the Justice
Department uninterested even in definitively determining his identity,
even though doing so might help get to the bottom of the matter.
 I recently asked a Justice Department official, who maintains
his confident view that Yousef is indeed Abdul Basit, &quot;Why
don't you bring the people who knew Abdul Basit to the prison
to meet Yousef, so they can say for sure if they are the same?&quot;
 &quot;But you&quot;, I was told, &quot;are interested in an intelligence
question.&quot; Earlier I had been told, &quot;It does not matter
what we call him. We just try a body.&quot;
<P>
    And so back we come to the high wall.  As before, those who
have the information about Ramzi Yousef and his bombing conspiracies
are not concerned with the question of state sponsorship, or at
least consider it secondary to their trials; while those who are
concerned with state sponsorship are denied the information that
they need to investigate the question properly.
<P>
<h3>Threats From Baghdad</h3>
<P>
MOST MEMBERS OF the U.S. national security bureaucracies think
that Saddam Hussein has largely lain low since the Gulf War, constrained
by economic sanctions and swift American reactions to his occasional
feints to the south.  But if in February 1993, Saddam ordered
his agents to try to topple New York's tallest tower onto its
twin, and if, in January 1995, Iraq sponsored an effort to destroy
eleven U.S. airplanes in the Far East, then Saddam has not been
quiescent.
<P>
   This, simply put, is why it is important to find out who Ramzi
Yousef is and who may have put him up to his murderous work. 
Maybe Iraq had nothing to do with him, despite all the circumstantial
evidence suggesting otherwise.  But if it did, then the otherwise
peculiar, bombastic, and extremely violent statements emanating
from Baghdad might make more sense than they at first seem to.
<P>
   In the fall of 1994, Baghdad's official press, in essence,
threatened that Saddam might use his remaining unconventional
agents, biological and chemical, for terrorism in America, or
in missiles delivered against his enemies in the region if and
when he became fed up with sanctions.[14]  On September 29, 1994,
following an otherwise cryptic statement of Saddam Hussein's,
the government newspaper, Babil, warned: &quot;Does the United
States realize the meaning of every Iraqi becoming a missile that
can cross to countries and cities?&quot;
<P>
Other threats followed almost daily;
<P>
<blockquote><i>   When peoples reach the verge of collective death, they will
be able to spread death to all. [15]
<P>
   When one realizes that death is one s  inexorable fate, there
remains nothing to deter one from taking the most risky steps
to influence the course of events. [16]
<P>
   We seek to tell the United States and its agents that the Iraqi
patience has run out and that the perpetuation of the crime of
annihilating the Iraqis will trigger crises whose nature and consequences
are known only to God.[17]</i></blockquote>
<P>
   These statements occurred in the context of Saddam's second
and abortive lunge at Kuwait, which was thwarted by the swift
U.S. deployment to the region. Saddam then turned around and formally
recognized Kuwait, removing what then seemed to be the last major
obstacle to lifting sanctions, and the Iraqi press soon began
to call 1995, &quot;the year of lifting sanctions.&quot;
<P>
   But that was not to be. The UN Special Commission (UNSCOM)
started to uncover evidence of a large, undeclared biological
program.  As Baghdad's disappointment grew, the Iraqi press began
to repeat the threats it had made in the fall.  The number two
man in Iraq's information ministry warned, &quot;Iraq's abandonment
of part of its weapons-the long-range missiles and chemical weapons.
. does not mean it has lost everything.&quot;[18]  Al-Quds al-Arabi,
a London paper financed by Baghdad and close to the Iraqi regime,
cautioned. &quot;Iraq still has options. But they are all destructive
options. Yet if the Americans continue to humiliate them, they
will have no option but to bring the temple down on everyone's
 head.&quot;19
<P>
    After Baghdad succeeded in getting a clean bill of health
from UNSCOM in mid-June on its chemical and missile programs,
it finally acknowledged in July having had an offensive biological
program and having produced anthrax and botulinim.  But it denied
that it had ever tried to weaponize those agents and, in any case,
claimed to have destroyed them in the fall of 1990.  The claim
was neither credible nor verifiable, particularly as Iraq produced
no documents detailing their destruction.  Indeed, the Iraqi &quot;revelations&quot;
may even have been meant as a threat, an attempt to intimidate
the United Nations by hinting at what Baghdad was still capable
of doing.[20]
<P>
    In early August 1995, as Iraq pressed UNSCOM for a clean bill
of health on its biological program, Hussein Kamil--Saddam's cousin
and son-in-law, and the man responsible for overseeing the build-up
of Iraq's unconventional weapons program defected. This precipitated
a flood of stunning revelations from Baghdad. They included the
admission that Iraq had indeed weaponized botulinim and anthrax.
 At the very same time that it had earlier claimed to be destroying
those agents, the Iraqi regime now acknowledged that it had been
stuffing them into bombs and missiles.  Yet Iraq still claimed
that whatever biological agents it had produced had been destroyed,
even as it still failed to produce any documents to confirm their
purported destruction.
<P>
   It looks as if Iraq is holding on to prohibited weapons of
mass destruction, even as it insists that sanctions be lifted.
Why?  In early September, a former adviser to Saddam Hussein predicted
that Iraq would not give up any more unconventional agents.  Instead,
Saddam would probably employ them for blackmail and brinkmanship
to get sanctions lifted.  And failing that, he would use them.[21]
 General Wafiq Samarrai, former head of Iraqi military intelligence,
told me much the same:  &quot;Tell the allies that they have to
destroy Iraq's biological agents before Saddam can use them.&quot;
 Iraq could attack its neighbors by missile, or America through
terrorism.  The United Stares might retaliate with nuclear weapons,
but by then &quot;the disaster will already have happened&quot;,
Samarrai warned. [22]
<P>
    Would Saddam actually do such a thing?  When asked about the
possibility of Saddam's using biological agents for terrorism
in America, UNSCOM chairman RoIf Ekeus replied, &quot;It is obviously
possible.&quot;[23]  Yet such thoughts seem far from the minds
of most U.S. officials, who believe that Saddam is trapped by
sanctions and can do no real harm.  They feel no urgency about
bringing Saddam down; they sense no danger.
<P>
<h3>Unfinished Business</h3>
<P>
YET IF RAMZI YOUSEF is in fact an Iraqi intelligence agent, there
obviously is a danger. Even if we cannot yet be absolutely certain
of this, so many American and allied lives are potentially at
stake that it seems the least a responsible government can do
is to make every reasonable effort to find out.  As Saddam Hussein
senses his ever-increasing isolation and sees the prospects for
lifting sanctions receding, his desperation may lead him to order
other, and even more ghastly, deeds.
<P>
    If Saddam Hussein still hungers for revenge, the question
of Ramzi Yousef's terrorism is much too important to be left solely
to the Justice Department, while the FBI continues to withhold
critical information from the national security bureaucracies.
<p></p>
 The following are among the steps that could and should be taken
to address the issue of whether Iraq is behind Ramzi Yousef and
to strengthen America's anti-terrorism efforts generally:
<P><blockquote>
 Bring those who knew Abdul Basit Karim before August 1990 to
meet Yousef in prison and pronounce definitely if they are one
and the same man.
<P>
 Demand the immediate and unconditional extradition of Abdul Rahman
Yasin from Baghdad.
<P>
 Establish a &quot;tiger team&quot;, drawn from the best and brightest
within the national security bureaucracies, to examine all the
information in the U.S. government's possession related to Yousef
and his bombing conspiracies. Yousef's apparent use of chemical
agents in New York and his threat to use them in the Philippines
deserve special attention.
<P>
 Establish appropriate procedures so that whenever a terrorist
attack occurs against U.S. targets that might be state-sponsored,
a qualified team will address the question of state sponsorship
regardless of whether the terror occurs on U.S. soil or whether
early  arrests are made.
<P></blockquote>
   Individually, the pieces of this puzzle--the elusive identity
and affiliation of the World Trade Center bomber; the series of
explicit threats against the United States issuing from Baghdad;
the question of Iraqi biological capabilities--raise troubling
questions.  Taken together, they provide the outline of a very
frightening possibility.  The lack of coordination between the
Departments of Justice and State may have created a niche for
terrorism within America's borders; while the lack of any adequate
response to the two major bombing conspiracies may have already
begun to undermine the credibility of the threat of deterrence.
 So far, State Department officials have been content to leave
the issue of Iraq's possible resort to biological terrorism on
the back burner, secure in the belief that the threat of nuclear
retaliation will be sufficient deterrent.  But Saddam has previously
miscalculated the American reaction to his provocations.  It would
be reassuring to know that, somewhere in the policy-apparatus
of the State Department, someone is looking seriously at the possibility
of future terrorist acts and at the requirements of effective
deterrence.
