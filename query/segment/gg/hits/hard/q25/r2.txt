Subsequently, the second state of the front airbag may not fire properly, which could lead to increased head and neck injuries.  The Fix: GM says that it will reprogram the sensor and diagnostic modules for free, which will remedy the problem immediately. GM hasn’t said when it will notify the owners of the cars, but Pontiac owners can call GM at 1-800-620-7668 for more information. Number of Vehicles Potentially Affected: The defect affects 12,043 2008 models made between November of 2007 and February 2008, and 26,401 2009 models that were made between May of 2008 and January of 2009.
