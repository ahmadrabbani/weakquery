CHICAGO -- Alleging that organized crime influenced government operations in the Town of
Cicero, three officials of the western suburb -- Town President <b> Betty
Loren-Maltese</b>, former public
safety director <b> Emil Schullo</b>, and former supervisor, trustee and treasurer
<b> Joseph DeChicio</b> -and seven
other defendants were indicted for allegedly diverting more than $10 million of public money to a
third party claims administrator for the town's self-insurance plans for their own personal benefit. Millions of
dollars allegedly were siphoned by the defendants to provide themselves with income and to finance
investments in a northern Wisconsin golf course, an Indiana horse farm, a home and automobiles. All 10
defendants were charged in a 17-count indictment alleging racketeering conspiracy, fraud, money
laundering and federal tax offenses, which was returned yesterday and unsealed this morning rafter FBI
and IRS agents began arresting the defendants, announced Scott R. Lassar, United States Attorney for
the Northern District of Illinois.

According to the indictment, between April 1992 and March 1997, Cicero paid a
newly incorporated and unlicenced insurance administration firm, Specialty Risk Consultants, Inc.,
(SRC), of Schaumburg, approximately $33.2 million; and SRC spent approximately $18.5 million on
town insurance expenses. Loren-Maltese, Schullo and DeChicio, who comprised the town insurance
committee, approved payment of approximately $28 million to SRC, knowing that the payments-

often weekly wire transfers of money - without complying with town ordinances and obtaining approval
from the town board, as required by a local ordinance. Of that amount, more than $10 million paid to
Specialty Risk allegedly was used for the benefit of the defendants and not for the town's insurance
expenses. The indictment seeks forfeiture of $10 million, the Four Seasons golf course in Pembine, Wis.,
which the defendants purchased and renovated to operate a casino gambling business, and a Wisconsin
residence.

Loren-Maltese was an aide to former Cicero Town President Henry Klosak until he died on
Dec. 28, 1992, and she was married to Frank Maltese, Cicero town assessor and a trustee who died on
Oct. 19, 1993. She was appointed a trustee and interim town president in January 1993 to replace
Klosak and was elected town president in 1993, 1997 and this past April for a third four-year term.

"By disguising transfers from the town as insurance payments, the defendants successfully
looted the Town of Cicero of millions of dollars," Mr. Lassar said. "They used their mob
connections to turn Cicero into their personal piggy bank."

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<p align="left">
Mr. Lassar announced the charges with Kathleen McChesney, Special Agent-in-Charge of
the Chicago Field Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and James W. Martin, Special

According to the indictment, Frank Maltese and the elder Spano "were associated with
organized crime and used their organized crime relationship to influence the operations of the Cicero
Town government." Between February 1992 and November 1998, the defendants, along with Frank
Maltese, allegedly conspired to conduct the affairs of SRC through a pattern of racketeering activity
consisting of bribery, official misconduct, mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, money laundering and
interstate transportation of money stolen from Cicero. Separately, the defendants, along with Frank
Maltese, allegedly participated in a fraud scheme to obtain money from Cicero and to deprive its
citizens of their right to the honest services of their elected and appointed officials. The defendants
allegedly caused the town to divert millions of dollars to Specialty Risk "under the guise of ensuring
the payment of health care claims of Town employees and other insurance expenses," when, in fact,
a substantial amount of money was used to enrich themselves at the expense of the town and its
citizens.

Cicero maintained a self-insured employee health plan and was self-insured for general
liability and workers' compensation losses. In 1992, the indictment alleges that the elder Spano,
John LaGiglio, Loren-Maltese, Frank Maltese and Taylor caused Cicero to drop Travelers Plan
Administrators of Illinois, Inc., as its health claims administrator. SRC, which was never licensed
to provide insurance administration services and was secretly controlled by Spano, was incorporated
in February 1992 and began providing claims services for town employees in July 1992.
Loren_Maltese, Schullo and DeChicio were responsible for fair administration of the plan. No proposal or
contract substituting SRC as the town's claims administrator was ever submitted to or approved by
the town board. In fact, to provide the appearance of legitimacy to the manner in which SRC
obtained the town's business, the indictment alleges that after Klosak died, Schullo caused Klosak's
signature stamp to be placed on the SRC proposal to be given to accountants working for the town.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<p align="left">
As part of the fraud scheme, LaGiglio hired Taylor to manage SRC and to serve as nominee
for himself and Spano Sr. in various business ventures. In turn, Taylor, who was general manager
of SRC from 1992 to the spring of 1995, was required to kickback a portion of his salary to the elder
Spano. Defendants Schneider and Ross also allegedly managed SRC for Spano Sr. and John
LaGiglio at various times.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<p align="left">
Certain defendants allegedlypaid bribes to Loren-Maltese, Schullo and DeChicio to influence
them to continue the town's fraudulent overpayments to Specialty Risk. At SRC, John LaGiglio,
the elder Spano, Ross, Schneider and Taylor allegedly failed to keep the town's insurance funds in
fiduciary accounts as required by state insurance law. Loren-Maltese, Schullo and DeChicio
transferred or fired town employees who questioned the town's overpayments to SRC, and they
repeatedly took no action regarding the town auditor's formal recommendations that the town obtain
detailed financial statements from SRC on a regular basis, the indictment alleges.

In December 1993, Loren-Maltese caused Cicero to obtain a $3 million line of credit to borrow
money to give to SRC for the payment of health claims when the town had already given SRC more than
$8 million that year. In January 1994, as a result of the excessive payments to SRC and its failure to
make timely payments of the town's claims, the three insurance committee members caused town
employees to accept payroll deductions to defray unmet health care costs. The indictment adds that
between 1993 and 1997, the trio of town officials caused SRC to reimburse their personal health claims
at 100 percent, exceeding the benefits covered by the health plan, and to provide them with free life
insurance.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<p align="left">
As part of the fraud scheme, the non-public official defendants established and operated
various related companies, including Plaza Partners, Specialty Finance, Inc., Specialty Leasing, Inc.,
Specialty Claims Management, Inc., Specialty Personnel Leasing, Inc., Global International, Co., Crown
Point Farms, Miscauno Management Company, Inc., Centrex Research of Illinois, Inc., SRC Holding
Company, Inc., and S R C Holdings, Inc., which were predominantly funded by the transfer of millions
of dollars of the town's insurance funds to these companies through Specialty Risk. The defendants used
these companies to conceal the investment and expenditure of money that they acquired from the town,
and the younger Spano and Schneider caused the creation of fraudulent records and invoices that
misrepresented SRC's expenditures of town funds to. the town's auditors, according to the indictment.&nbsp;
