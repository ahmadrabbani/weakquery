Click here for complete archive   Colorado Springs anti-tax crusader Douglas Bruce has been indicted by a statewide grand jury on allegations he failed to pay taxes on income he earned during 2005, 2006 and 2007. He was held Friday afternoon at the El Paso County jail until posting a $10,000 bond. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers announced the indictment Friday, three days after Bruce, 61, lost a bid for an at-large seat on the Colorado Springs City Council. According to the four-count indictment, Bruce is accused of unlawfully funneling income he earned as an El Paso County Commissioner to Active Citizens Together, a nonprofit he created in 2001. Suthers said Bruce is accused of filing a false tax return on income he earned during the 2005 tax year and failing to file a tax return for income he earned during the 2006 and 2007 tax years. “State law requires that citizens who live in Colorado and enjoy all of the benefits of being a resident pay the appropriate taxes,” Suthers said in a news release.  “No one is exempt from that obligation.” Bruce was arrested about 1 p.m. Friday at a Colorado Springs post office by the Colorado Springs Police and booked into jail, said Mike Saccone, communications director for Suthers' office. He will face a first hearing in about two weeks in Denver District Court, Saccone said. The most serious charge against Bruce is attempting to influence a public servant, which is a class 4 felony. If convicted, Bruce could face up to six years in prison or up to $500,000 in fines. In addition, he faces two class 5 felonies for allegedly evading taxes and allegedly filing a false tax return. The final count is a misdemeanor charge of failure to file a return or pay a tax. The Colorado Department of Revenue began investigating Bruce in 2004 after he told news reporters his salary as El Paso County Commissioner would be paid to charity. Bruce served on the county commission from 2005 until December 2007 when he was appointed to the Colorado House of Representatives. On his 2005 state tax return, Bruce showed no taxable income and requested a refund of $1,600 -- the withholding from his salary as a commissioner. In 2006, the state revenue agency wrote Bruce and notified him that his tax returns were being audited and asked him for his 2005 federal tax return with attachments. His response, in 2009, led to the most serious charge. The indictment says Bruce attempted to illegally influence Roxy Huber, the executive director of the revenue agency, and her agent Shirley Stevens "by means of deceit" in his response. "The documentation provided by Mr. Bruce in April 2009 consisted of false information that was used as an attempt to defraud and influence" Huber and Stevens, the indictment states. "This act attributed to Mr. Bruce was deceitful and done with the intent to alter or affect their decision." The indictment says Bruce's 2005 federal tax return listed wages of $39,801, interest income of $117, a rental loss of $25,000, gifts to charity of $45,376 and an IRA deduction of $5,000. Typically, the state relies on a federal tax return to assess Colorado state taxes. The indictment said Bruce's federal return "raised suspicions as to the validity" of his state return. After more investigation, the agency concluded Bruce failed to include income from a $388,233 payoff of an interest-only real estate loan as part of his 2005 return. The income from that loan included interest of $17,500, plus additional interest of $5,983 and late fees of $4,200. "As a result of his actions, Mr. Bruce willfully filed a false return" between April 2006 and 2009. The indictment further alleges Bruce received loan payments and interest income that he failed to include on state or federal tax forms. The indictment is the latest chapter in a long, colorful history of the controversial Bruce, who became the darling of limited government advocates in 1992 when he wrote and won passage of the government spending limitation measure called the Colorado Taxpayers Bill of Rights. The so-called TABOR put limits on government budget growth and its ability to raise taxes. He's had mixed success in the political arena ever since. He failed twice to win seats in the Colorado Senate, losing in 1996 and 2000. Even when he won a seat on the five-member county commission in 2004, he found himself the lone dissenting vote on most issues. And he made headlines for his comments to his colleagues and citizens that were deemed caustic and insensitive. His move to the Colorado General Assembly was equally explosive. He kicked a news photographer during the opening prayer on the day he was sworn into office, leading his colleagues to formally censure him. Bruce is the only lawmaker in state history to suffer a public censure. If convicted of all charges, Bruce may not be finished as a politician or petitioner. According to Rich Coolidge of the Secretary of State's office, if Bruce is convicted, and serves his full sentence, including parole, he'd become eligible again to register to vote, run for office and gather petitions.    Form was NOT submitted.
