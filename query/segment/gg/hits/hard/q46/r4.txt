   DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
  The Department of Justice said it has charged two Swiss bankers at the same unspecified bank with tax-evasion conspiracy on more than $600 million in U.S. clients' accounts.  The U.S. has been cracking down on alleged tax evasion through hidden offshore accounts.  Daniela Casadei and Fabio Frazzetto, the two Swiss client advisers, were charged with conspiring with U.S. taxpayer-clients and others to hide the more than $600 million in offshore accounts and void U.S. taxes.  The indictment against the two claims they advised U.S. clients to open undeclared accounts under codes or fictional names and told clients not to worry about U.S. law enforcement because their bank no longer had offices on U.S. soil.  The U.S. has been one of the most vocal critics of Switzerland's banking-secrecy laws. The U.S. pressure on Switzerland culminated with a 2009 deal in which UBS AG (UBS, UBSN.VX) agreed to hand over more than 4,000 names of U.S. account holders, which prompted thousands of others to come forward under a voluntary disclosure program. Data from those accounts is enabling U.S. officials to target more tax evasion around the world.  Tuesday, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York said Casadei worked at the bank from the early 1990s through at least 2010, and Frazzetto worked at the bank from 2005 through at least 2010. He claimed the two conspired with various U.S. taxpayers and others to ensure that clients could hide their Swiss bank accounts and the income generated in the accounts from the IRS.  The indictment further claims that the two opened and managed accounts for U.S. taxpayers under fake names like "Hydrangea" and "Red Rubin" or in the name of a non-U.S. relative or phony corporate entity to help conceal the tax-liable ownership of the accounts. It alleges they ensured that mail relevant to the accounts wasn't sent to U.S. taxpayer clients in the U.S. and insisted many of the clients travel to Switzerland to conduct business related to the funds.  Both bankers reside in Switzerland and face a maximum possible sentence of five years in prison. They also face up to three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or possibly more.   -By Joan E.
