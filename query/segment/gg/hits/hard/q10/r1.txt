 Mail relay testing

 Mail relay testing  We offer an experimental mail relay testing service. It runs in two modes:  Anonymous mode sends commands to the server to be tested but doesn't actually send any mail. This can report false positives, hosts that appear to be open relays but actually aren't because they reject or discard a message after appearing to accept it.  Registered user mode attempts to relay a message through the server to be tested. You must be a registered abuse.net user, and the relayed message will be addressed to you. If you're testing a server that accepts mail for your e-mail address, abuse.net can generate a temporary alias in the abuse.net domain that will be forwarded to you.  To limit the likelihood of abuse, the relay tester limits the number of tests a single user can make to ten per hour. If an IP address has been tested recently, it will report the results of that test, rather than retesting. If a network owner asks that we refrain from testing, we won't test any address on that network at all.  All tests are logged, of course.  If you are a registered user, you have to identify yourself with your e-mail address and the registration password that abuse.net sent in the subject line of your welcome message. If you're not a registered user but would like to register, send e-mail to  new@abuse.net and respond to the welcome message it sends.   Address to test: (as host name or dotted quad)   Your e-mail address: (leave blank for anonymous mode)   Your abuse.net password: (see below if you don't know it)   Check this box if you're testing a server that normally receives mail for you.  Create an abuse.net address (Address valid for 24 hours only)     Click this button to start testing   If you are a registered abuse.net user but don't have the abuse.net password from your welcome message, enter your e-mail address above and click this button to mail yourself your password.
