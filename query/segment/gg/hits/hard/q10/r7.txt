Abstract This document defines an extensible format and MIME type that may be used by network operators to report email abuse to other parties. This format is intended as a machine readable replacement for various existing abuse report formats currently used in Internet email.

However, different operators define their own formats and the receivers are forced to write custom software to interpret the many types of them. This memo seeks to define a standard extensible format and the "message/abuse-report" MIME type for abuse reports in accordance with  RFC 2048 Freed, N., Klensin, J. and J. Postel, Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures, November 1996.  [4]. This format and content type is intended to be used within the scope of the framework of the "multipart/report" content type defined in  RFC 3462 Vaudreuil, G., The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages, January 2003.  [1].  This document only defines the format and content type to be used for these reports. Determination of where these reports should be sent is outside the scope of this document.    TOC      2. Intent The abuse reports defined in this document are intended for several purposes:  a To inform ISPs about email abuse originating from their networks  b To provide feedback to email service providers about abuse complaints    Note that the abuse reports defined in this document are limited to reporting email abuse only.    TOC      3. Requirements The following requirements are necessary for abuse reports :  a They must be both human and machine readable  b Copy of the original email message or email headers must be enclosed in order to allow the receiver to properly handle the report.      TOC      4. Format of Email Abuse Reports An email abuse report is a MIME message with a top level MIME content type of "multipart/report" (as defined in  RFC 3462 Vaudreuil, G., The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages, January 2003.  [1]). The following apply:  a The "report-type" parameter of "multipart/report" type is set to "abuse-report".  b The first MIME part of the message contains a human readable description of the report  c The second MIME part of the message contains a machine readable abuse report with the content type of "message/abuse-report" (defined later on in this document).  d The third MIME part of the message contains either a full copy of the original message with a MIME content type of "message/rfc822" (as defined in  RFC 2046 Vaudreuil, G., The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages, January 2003.  [1]) OR a copy of the headers from the original message with MIME content type of "text/rfc822-headers" (as defined in  RFC 3462 Vaudreuil, G., The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages, January 2003.  [1]).  e Each abuse report should related to a single originating message.  f The subject line of the abuse report should read as "Email Abuse Report for IP X.X.X.X" where "X.X.X.X" is the source IP of the MTA from which the original message was received.  g Note that unlike the definition in  RFC 3462 Vaudreuil, G., The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages, January 2003.  [1], all three parts are required for abuse reports.      TOC      5. Format of 'message/abuse-report' Content Type The message/abuse-report content type consists of several header fields as follows:  a "Source-IP:" - contains an IPv4 or IPv6 address of the MTA from which the original message was received.  b "Received-Date:" - date the original message was received. This field is formatted in according to the definition in section 3.3 of  RFC 2822 Resnick, P., Internet Message Format, April 2001.  [2]  c "Original-Message-ID:" - contains the  RFC 2822 Resnick, P., Internet Message Format, April 2001.  [2] Message-ID of the original message      TOC      6. MIME Type Registration of message/abuse-report This section provides the media type registration application (as per  RFC 2048 Freed, N., Klensin, J. and J. Postel, Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures, November 1996.  [4], which will be submitted to IANA after IESG approval of this document.  To: ietf-types@iana.org  Subject: Registration of MIME media types message/abuse-report  MIME media type name: message  MIME subtype name: abuse-report  Required parameters: none  Optional parameters: none  Encoding considerations:  "7bit" encoding is sufficient and MUST be used to maintain readability when viewed by non-MIME mail readers.   Security considerations:  See section 3 of  RFC 3462 Vaudreuil, G., The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages, January 2003.  [1]   Interoperability considerations: none  Published specification: this document  Applications which use this media type: Abuse helpdesk software for ISPs  Additional information:  Magic number(s): none  File extension(s): none  Macintosh File Type Code(s): none   Person & email address to contact for further information:  Yakov Shafranovich <ietf@shaftek.org>   Intended usage: COMMON  Author/Change controller: IESG    TOC      7. IANA Considerations After IESG approval, IANA is expected to register MIME type "message/abuse-report" using the application provided in this document.    TOC      8. Security Considerations See section 3 of  RFC 3462 Vaudreuil, G., The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages, January 2003.
