Mail relay testing
</H1>
We offer an experimental mail relay testing service.
It runs in two modes:
<UL><LI>
<I>Anonymous mode</I> sends commands to the server to be tested but
doesn't actually send any mail.
This can report false positives, hosts that appear to be open relays
but actually aren't because they reject or discard a message after
appearing to accept it.
<LI>
<I>Registered user mode</I> attempts to relay a message through the
server to be tested.
You must be a registered abuse.net user, and the relayed message will
be addressed to you.
If you're testing  a server that accepts mail for your e-mail address,
abuse.net can generate a temporary alias in the abuse.net domain that
will be forwarded to you.
</UL>
<P>
To limit the likelihood of abuse, the relay tester limits the number of
tests a single user can make to ten per hour.
If an IP address has been tested recently, it will
report the results of that test, rather than retesting.
If a network owner asks that we refrain from testing, we won't test any
address on that network at all.
<P>
All tests are logged, of course.
<P>
If you are a registered user, you have to identify yourself with your
e-mail address and the registration password that abuse.net sent in the
subject line of your welcome message.
If you're not a registered user but would like to register, send e-mail
to <tt>new&#64;abuse.net</tt> and respond to the
welcome message it sends.
<P>
