PRINCIPAL EXPEDITIONS DURING THE  HEROIC AGE OF ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION    This is 'edited from and extracted from' Bob Headland's  A Chronology of Antarctic Exploration which was issued by Bernard Quaritch in 2009. It is included   here  with the permission of the author.  One can see a review of this essential volume at   elsewhere on this site  .  Also an extensive review in the recently published    Nimrod   , the journal of the 'Shackleton Autumn School.'  —Robert B. Stephenson   AN HISTORICAL TIMELINE OF ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION    I created this  Historical Timeline of Antarctic Exploration for use as a handout for talks on Antarctic history. It was done somewhat hurriedly and I haven't got around to correcting a few of the errors that I know exist. Please feel free to comment or point out mistakes.  It was created in Pagemaker at a size of 38 by 25 inches. The largest at which I've printed it out is 17 by 11 inches, just readable. It has been converted into an Adobe Acrobat document which will come up in your browser window when you   click here  .  —Robert B. Stephenson    CONCISE CHRONOLOGY OF APPROACH TO THE POLES    This chronology was prepared by  Robert K. Headland , Archivist and Curator, Scott Polar Research Institute. It appears here courtesy of Mr Headland and SPRI. Note: Only the Antarctic portion is included here.  The following Antarctic and Arctic lists give explorations, in chronological order, towards the South Pole and North Pole, their attainment (air and surface, and by sea in the Arctic), and the first crossings of the regions. There are several claims included which are unverified and extremely doubtful, although some of these pretensions have been well publicised.  —R. K. Headland  ANTARCTIC  1603. Gabriel de Castilla (Spain), aboard  Nuestra Sefiora de la Mercedes , probably penetrated to 64°S in the Southern Ocean south of Drake Passage. Subsequently several merchant vessels reported being blown south of 60°S [66·67gS] rounding Cabo de Hornos in severe weather.  1773. James Cook (Britain), with companies aboard HMS  Resolution and HMS  Adventure , crossed the Antarctic Circle (66·53°S [73·92gS]) off Enderby land, 17 January.  1774. James Cook (Britain) on the same expedition reached 71·17°S [79·08gS] off Marie Byrd Land, 30 January.  1820. Fabian von Bellingshausen (Russia), with companies aboard  Vostok and  Mirnyy , sighted the Antarctic continent at about 69·35°S [77·06gS] off Dronning Maud Land, 27 January.  1823. James Weddell (Britain), with company aboard  Jane reached 74·25°S [82.50gS] in the Weddell Sea, 20 February.  1842. James Ross (Britain), with companies aboard HMS  Erebus and HMS  Terror , reached 78·17°S [86·86gS] in the Ross Sea, 23 February.  1900. Hugh Evans (Britain) and 3 others sledged to 78·83°S [87·59gS] on the Ross Ice Shelf, 23 February.  1902.

Roald Amundsen (Norway) and 4 others dog-sledged to 90°S [100gS], 14 December.  1912. Robert Scott (Britain) and 4 others sledged to 90°S [100gS], 17 January (all perished during the return journey).  1929. Richard Byrd (United States), with an aircraft crew, claimed to have flown over the South Pole from the Ross Ice Shelf, 29 November.  1947. Richard Byrd (United States), with crew aboard two aircraft, flew over the South Pole from the Ross Ice Shelf, 15 February.  1956. John Torbert (United States) and 6 others flew across Antarctica over the South Pole (Ross Island to Weddell Sea and returned without landing), 13 January.  1956. Conrad Shinn (United States), with crew of an aircraft, landed at the South Pole, 31 October, a permanent station was then established sustained by aircraft.  Subsequently many aircraft have landed at the South Pole.  1958. Vivian Fuchs (British Commonwealth) and an expeditionary party reached the South Pole with motor vehicles and sledge dogs, 20 January and continued to cross Antarctica (Weddell Sea to Ross Sea).  Subsequently several expeditions have crossed the Antarctic through the South Pole by surface and many have made one-way surface journeys leaving by aircraft.
