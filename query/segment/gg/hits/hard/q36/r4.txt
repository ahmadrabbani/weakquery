With the silver medal, the second and the third-year students from Saint Launrencia senior high school in Serpong, Tangerang, have proven to the world that Indonesia has many young talented scientists.  "We know that the growth of the human population continues to boom while the growth of supporting resources are not that fast," Terrenz told  The Jakarta Post in an interview at her school recently.  She said it was time to think about how to curb the rapid increase in human population through fertility reduction.  "Such a condition inspired us to start an experiment titled 'The Effects of Mangosteen Peel Extract on the Fertility of Male White Mice'," she said.  Terrenz and Lynn said they wanted to take on the challenge to prove the hypothesis that mangosteen peel contained a compound that could reduce fertility.  They extracted the compound from mangosteen peel and mixed it with petroleum ether liquefier. The mixture was then fed to male white mice that were separated into three different groups. Two groups were not given the extract at all.  After 40 days, Terrenz and Lynn conducted autopsies and removed the testis and epididymis organs from the male mice to be observed under a microscope in the school's laboratory.  "If the epididymis process stopped, it meant that spermatogenesis of the mice could last, but when we found more and more empty cavities in the epididynis, it meant that spermatogenesis was hampered," Terrenz said.  Terrenz, who presented the research results at ICYS alone, as Lynn was not able to accompany her to Ukraine, said the experiment took 40 days.  The gold medal for the ecology research contest that Terrenz took part in was awarded to a team of Kroatian students.  "I was happy every day during the competition because I could see many students from various countries and they had brilliant ideas," she said.  She added her father, Joseph Sanusi Tjong, and mother, Hemelinda Brigita, supported her desire to compete in the annual international young scientists' research contest.  "My parents did not object to spending Rp 30 million to let me join the research contest, as the government does not provide any funding to support Indonesian students to compete abroad," she said.  Terrenz said she liked to read and aspired to become a scientist, with a specific interest in biotechnology.  Nine teams from Indonesia competed in the international competition, which included the fields of computer science, physics, math, engineering, ecology and environmental science.  The Saint Laurencia school sent two research teams to represent the country at the contest. Terrenz and Lynn joined the ecology research field with their research.  Another team, represented by Cassandra Jayanthy and Renatta Nataraharja, took part in the environmental science field with their research titled "Exploiting Gray Water". This team won a bronze medal.  This is the second silver medal the Saint Laurencia school has obtained through prestigious International research competitions this year.  Two other students -- Adrienne Trinovia Sulistyo and Vici Riyani Tedja -- also won a silver medal at the International Environment Project Olympiad competition held from April 1 to 6 in Baku, Azerbaijan.  Terrenz and Lynn conducted research, presented and discussed the results, formulated research reports and prepared a presentation in English prior to the contest.  "Hard work and support from our parents and teachers were the main keys to our success in the research that took me to Ukraine to competed with other students from all over the world," she said.  Such international research contests are aimed at promoting an interest in science among the younger generation, as well as discovering the potential of young researchers who would play important roles in scientific and technological innovation and development in the future.  The ICYS is an international institution that pays attention to the education and potential of highly talented high school students around the world.
