<h3>World

Population</h3>



<p><b>

<a href="../../Discover/issues.htm"><font size="2">Update here</font></a></b></p>



<p align="right"><b><font size="1">Volume 4, Number 3<br>

(1994)</font></b></p>



<p><b>The United Nations

International Conference on Population and Development was held in Cairo, Egypt from

September 5-13, 1994.</b> This was the fifth in a series of international conferences

on population since 1954, including Belgrade 1965, Bucharest 1974 and Mexico City 1984.

This was the third under U.N. auspices.</p>



<p>Writing for <em>The

Sciences</em> magazine, Nathan Keyfitz says, "One of the most vital matters facing

humankind is the expansion of the population within a fixed natural ecology and the urgent

need for the kind of economic growth which will relieve the stubborn poverty that still

exists."</p>



<p><b>There is a new

urgency since exponential growth in both population and consumption is threatening the

world's ability to develop in a sustainable manner.</b> Consider the fact that we are

adding one billion people to the worlds population every 12 years. Over the next 50 years

the world's population is projected to soar from 5.6 billion to 9.6 billion, or more, and

96 percent of that growth will be in developing nations, primarily in the Southern

Hemisphere.</p>



<p><b>The rate of growth

of the human population does not allow for sudden variations, except through widespread

mortality crises or massive, authoritarian manipulation of fertility.</b> Compared

with other animal species, human reproduction is slow, sexual maturity is late, fertility

low and the number of old individuals large. All these factors give human population

considerable inertia. Even in the unlikely event that we managed to immediately reduce

world fertility to a level of simple replacement (on the order of two children per couple)

and maintain this level in the future, the world population, due to the effects of its

present age distribution and to the expected increase in life expectancy, would continue

to grow for approximately a century before leveling off at a level which would almost

double the present figure. Currently 32 percent of the population in developing nations is

under the age of 15 and is coming into the reproductive stage.</p>



<p><b>Countries in which

people are well fed, in which infant mortality is low, in which women have access to

education are countries in which the birth rate and the rate of increase are the lowest. </b>There

is little doubt that development brings about a decline in the birth rate. However, the

world's population is growing so fast that development alone is not going to be enough.

There has been an ongoing debate about whether population control led to development or

development led to population control. Clearly these two approaches have to work hand in

hand. Family planning has to work together with economic development.</p>

<h4>Ecological

Sustainability</h4>



<p>A society

is ecologically sustainable when it:</p>



<blockquote>

  <ul>

    <li><p>Conserves

      ecological life-support systems and biodiversity.</p>

    </li>

    <li><p>Ensures

      that use of renewable resources are sustainable and minimize the depletion of nonrenewable

      resources.</p>

    </li>

    <li><p>Keeps

      within the carrying system of supporting ecosystems.</p>

    </li>

  </ul>

</blockquote>



<hr size="1">



<h4>The

Threat is Real</h4>



<p><b>The greatest

single threat to society, the economy, and the environment is human population growth.</b>

The world population is growing at the rate of three people per second, 250,000 people per

day, or 94 million per year (the population of Mexico).</p>

<p><b>China's population

is projected to reach 1.54 billion in 2025, roughly equal to the entire world population

in 1960.</b> In 2025 India's population is projected to equal that of China. India

may have achieved its "green miracle" by overworking its croplands and depleting

its watershed. Nigeria's population is expected to double to 180 million in the next 25

years. The earth is our production capacity and the earth's bounty is the production. When

production exceeds production capacity for an extended period, the production capacity is

diminished.</p>

<p><b>The pressure on

natural resources increases with global consumption, which in turn depends on the average

consumption and number of inhabitants. </b>this pressure can therefore be eased

either by acting on population growth or by acting on consumption growth. If we look at

particular areas, we realize that the demographic factor is important in developing

countries, which have a reduced and generally slow-growing rate of consumption, while in

the developed countries exactly the opposite happens.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p align="center"><b>Thirty-two

  percent of the people living in developing countries are under 15 years of age and their

  fertility as adults will make an enormous difference to population growth rates in the

  next century and consequently to the availability of resources.</b></p>

</blockquote>



<hr size="1">



<p><b>Since the per

capita levels of consumption differ so widely between rich and poor countries, the paradox

arises where every birth in the North puts as much pressure on resources as tens of births

in the South. </b>This is the cause of a lot of North-South finger pointing. We in

the North tell those in the South to get a grip on fertility and population growth. They

look back and tell us to get a grip on consumption. Ironically, a case can also be made

for a reduction of fertility in the North, something difficult to suggest since Northern

countries have already reduced their birth rates to below replacement levels and it seems

unlikely that they could go much further in this direction.</p>

<p><b>If present trends

continue, energy consumption and production of pollutants will double over the next 20

years.</b> Today, 20 percent of the worlds population consumes 80 percent of the

planet's resources and produces 80 percent of the global pollution. The real issue is not

only the total number of persons, but the resources consumed and the pollution produced by

each person. Population increases combined with consumption increases have serious human,

economic, and environmental consequences.</p>



<h4>A

National Security Issue</h4>



<p>Undersecretary of State,

Tim Wirth, Clinton's point man on population says "We have some interest in

maintaining a modicum of stability around the world. If populations grow so dramatically

that their are millions of young people with no stake in what goes on in their society,

that is an invitation to a kind of anarchy."</p>



<h4>Potential

for Anarchy</h4>



<p><b>The cover of the

February 1994 issue of Atlantic Monthly reads "The Coming Anarchy."</b> The

rest of the cover reads "nations break up under the tidal flow of refugees from

environmental and social disaster. As borders crumble, another type of boundary is erected

- a wall of disease. Wars are fought over scarce resources, especially water, and war

itself becomes continuous with crime, as armed bands of stateless marauders clash with the

private security forces of the elites. A preview of the first decades of the twenty-first

century. By Robert Kaplan."</p>



<p>Kaplan writes that

environment is the national security issue of the 21st century. "The political and

strategic impact of surging populations, spreading disease, deforestation, soil erosion,

water depletion, air pollution, and possible rising sea levels in critical overcrowded

regions that will prompt mass immigrations and in turn incite group conflicts - will be

the foreign policy change from which most others ultimately emanate, arousing the public

and uniting assorted interests left over from the cold war. Environmental scarcity will

inflame existing hatreds and affect power relationships at which we now look. Surging

populations lead to environmental degradation which leads to ethnic conflict."</p>



<p><b>West Africa

provides an appropriate introduction to the issue, often extremely unpleasant to discuss,

that will soon confront our civilization. </b>Disease, overpopulation, unprovoked

crime, scarcity of resources, refugee migrations, the increasing erosion of nation-states

and international borders, and the empowerment of private armies, security firs, and

international drug cartels are now most tellingly demonstrated through a West African

prism. Consider Nigeria now with a population of 90 million including that of its largest

city Lagos whose crime, pollution, and overcrowding make it the cliche par excellence of

Third World urban dysfunction. The population of Nigeria is projected to double in the

next 25 years while the country continues to deplete its natural resources. As the

burgeoning populations deplete the resources they move to the city and become the urban

poor.</p>



<hr size="1">



<p align="center"><b>&nbsp;Polygamy

continues to proliferate in sub-Saharan Africa boosting the birth rate, the spread of the

AIDS virus, and both deforestation and desertification which in turn drives people to the

cities to live in slums. Of the estimated 12 billion people in the world who are HIV

positive, 8 billion are in Africa.</b></p>



<hr size="1">



<h4>Water

Quality and Population</h4>



<p><b>One of the gravest

threats to water quality as a result of overpopulation is the spread of waterborne

disease, especially in tropical countries.</b> Some 25,000 people die every day from

diseases carried by polluted waters such as cholera, typhoid and dysentery.</p>



<p>Water is a finite

resource, the global water cycle remains constant. The amount of global fresh water,

approximately .5 percent of the total water on earth has not increased since the

beginnings of civilization. Yet population increases caused world water use to double

between 1900 and 1950 and double again by 1990. In addition to causing immediate

shortages, intense usage pressure severely damages water resources. Aquifer depletion,

lowered water tables and salt water intrusion decrease the amount of water suitable for

human use.</p>



<p>Water resources do not

limit population growth. Rather, they limit the level of economic development or living

standards achievable.</p>



<hr size="1">



<blockquote>

  <p align="center"><em><b>&nbsp;A

  sustainable society enables its members to achieve a high quality of life in ways that are

  ecologically sustainable.</b></em></p>

</blockquote>



<hr size="1">



<p>As urban concentrations in

developing countries intensify, the amount of human waste increases while the ability to

provide proper treatment and disposal decreases. Water pollution by human waste is

widespread and water borne disease accounts for 80 percent of all child deaths in

developing countries.</p>



<p><b>If we do not look

beyond short term profits and political boundaries to solve a pending world water crises,

the results will be devastating and potentially irreversible. </b>Mass drought,

starvation and political upheaval will be a given in the semi-arid third world, globally,

the results will be the extermination of wildlife and habitat, toxic contamination of

drinking water supplies, loss of critical farmland and a deteriorating quality of life for

all.</p>

<h4>Different

Opinions</h4>



<p><b>Economists have a

lot more faith in science and technology to accommodate more and more growth than

scientists do.</b> Looking back at previous international population conferences, it

is clear that by 1954 the chief question was whether development would by itself lead to

population control, or would population control be required before development could take

place.</p>



<p><b>The central focus

of modern economics is on growth, the idea that increasing productivity brings employment

and prosperity.</b> with sufficient economic growth, population growth is not to be

feared. The resulting wealth, economist maintain, will in turn counteract the incidental

ill effects of growth. Biologists, on the other hand, see the economy as embedded in a

fragile ecosphere, upon which growth acts in dangerous, inscrutable ways. The two groups

agree that sooner or later both the number of people in the world and the amount of goods

those people produce/consume will have to stop increasing. Beyond that, however,

economists and biologists diverge radically on some fundamental questions to include:</p>



<blockquote>

  <ul>

    <li><p>How urgent is it that

      population growth and rising productivity be curtailed?</p>

    </li>

    <li><p>What sacrifices in

      checking growth are acceptable?</p>

    </li>

    <li><p>With development, family

      size will eventually fall and sooner or later human population will stabilize. Is it safe

      to let the process take care of itself?</p>

    </li>

  </ul>

</blockquote>

  sooner population growth ceases, the more time humanity has to redress the mistakes of

<p><b>Option

#1</b> is inhumane. Unfortunately, on our current path it is an option which

is being exercised on a regular basis and one which will account for increasingly more

deaths. Many zealots even think catastrophic events are desirable or "God's

will."</p>



<p><b>Option

#2</b> is a highly charged one involving individual values, women's rights,

and religious beliefs. Abortion is commonly used for birth control, when other kinds are

not available. This option brings up the debate over whose fertility is being controlled

and how that influences the political/racial/ethnic/religious mix. Leaders of most

developing nations accept the need for family planning, but suspicions of ulterior motives

never lurk far beneath the surface.</p>



<p><b>Option

#3</b> is much less controversial. Ecologically sustainable and socially

acceptable economic development is a choice that everyone can be for. That is what

sustainable development is all about, "meeting the needs of the present without

compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." It's about a

vision where we live in harmony with nature and each other. The record shows that

education and empowerment reduce fertility rates and population growth.</p>



<p>It is quite obvious that

Options #2 and #3 will have to work in concert if we are going to head off Option #1 and

if we are going to win the race, the human race to a sustainable society.</p>

<p>In a previous <i>Eco-Link</i>

(Volume 4, Number 1) we pointed out that almost everything that reduces population growth

is considered bad which obviously creates a dilemma. What option(s) would you chose for

bringing the population under control?</p>



<h4>Family

Planning</h4>



<p>When serving as Director

For US Agency for International Developments' Office of Population, R.T. Ravenholt, M.D.

wrote a concise statement of "AID'S Family Planning Strategy," which concluded:</p>



<p>"Regardless of what

special social measures may ultimately be needed for optimal regulation of fertility, it

is clear that the main element initially in any population planning and control program

should be the extension of family planning information and means to all elements of the

population. It seems reasonable to believe that when women throughout the world need

reproduce only if and when they choose, then the many intense family and social problems

generated by unplanned, unwanted, and poorly cared for children will be greatly

ameliorated and the now acute problem of too rapid population growth will be reduced to

manageable proportions."</p>

<div align="center"><center>



<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="1" width="450">

  <tr>

    <td><p><b>In a

    paper titled "America's Shattered Child Plague" presented to Peninsula College

    in Port Angeles, Washington, Dr. Ravenholt writes, "Two fundamental precepts must

    guide reproduction in every sound society; first every child should be a wanted and

    well-cared-for child; second, no one should reproduce beyond their means of providing for

    their off-spring.</b></td>

</table>

</center></div>



<p>Writing for the Free

Inquiry Journal, Dr. Ravenholt, who is now president of Population Health Imperatives in

Seattle, says, "throughout human experience until quite recently, tribal and species

survival needs dictated that women reproduce with little or no constraint. But as

scientific knowledge and its products evolved with accelerating speed during the 19th and

20th centuries, death rates fell. Consequently, an urgent need arose to reduce population

growth to levels commensurate with available resources, in accordance with the

developmental condition equation:</p>



<p>According to John

Bongaarts of the Population Council in New York City, education, occupation, wealth,

location, religious belief and social status are indirect determinants of fertility.

Because they are indirect, their effect on fertility is difficult to interpret. Of the

direct influences, the most powerful is family planning. Bongaarts says, "a country's

contraceptive prevalence rate - the percentage of married women of reproductive age who

use any contraception - largely determines its fertility rate." The data also

confirms that better educated women are more likely to practice some form of contraception

than are women with little or no education.</p>

<h4>Demographic

Transitions</h4>



<p>An article titled

"The Fertility Decline in Developing Countries" appeared in the December 1993

edition of the Scientific American. The article says, "demographic transition theory

holds that societies are initially characterized by high fertility and high mortality,

population does not grow. This phase is followed by an intermediate stage in which

modernization begins and mortality is reduced but fertility remains high. This period is

one of rapid population growth, only later does fertility decline. The last era, one of

stable population growth, low mortality and fertility, describes most of the developed

world." The article goes on to say, "The recent decline in fertility rates among

developing countries does not fit this theoretical framework well with respect to timing

or circumstance. Fertility rates in developing countries have fallen much more rapidly

than they did during the European demographic transition. The findings dispute the notion

that "development is the best contraceptive," a phrase that originated at the

1974 World Population Conference in Bucharest. This view held that fertility would not

drop until developing economies improved."</p>



<p><b>The differences

between fertility declines in developing countries today and those seen in Europe may be

best explained by differences in the approaches to family planning.</b> During the

West's demographic transition, modern contraceptives were not yet invented, and the

concept of family planning was not quickly accepted. The availability of effective

contraception gives developing countries a major advantage over the European societies

that underwent fertility declines earlier.</p>



<h4>Survival<font size="3"><b>

of the Fittest?</b></font></h4>



<p><b>In the closing

words of The Origin of Species, Charles Darwin clearly identifies evolution with virtually

unstoppable progress. </b>He writes, "As natural selection works solely by and

for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental environments will tend to progress

toward perfection." Modern biologists, however, find thoroughly unacceptable the 19th

century view that the earth's history has been an inexorable march toward the goal of

contemporary humanity. As the geologist and paleontologist Stephen J. Gould of Harvard has

written, "This common scenario is fiction rooted in traditional hopes for progress

and predictability."</p>



<p><b>To a large extent

we have freed ourselves from natural selection or survival of the fittest in the

traditional sense. </b>We are not well equipped to live in the wild, yet we can live

wherever we want, and we can push any other creature out of its niche if we so choose. We

have controlled death to the point where our birth rate far exceeds our death rate which

accounts for runaway population growth. We have no predator to worry about except

ourselves. We have developed technology to carry us to the moon and back (significant in

biological terms as well as scientific terms). We are the only species that can visualize

our future. We need to use that vision and the technology we have developed to achieve a

sustainable society.</p>



<hr size="1">



<blockquote>

  <p><em>There is no

  doubt about the fact that we humans are the most highly evolved creatures on earth, with

  brains enormous for our body size. Yet, in a world estimated to be some 5 billion years

  old...we just got here. Our first know ancestor is "Lucy," a female who lived on

  the African continent, lived just 3.2 million years ago, a blink in time considering that

  there were 65 million years between the dinosaurs and our arrival. Where we go from here

  is up to us.</em></p>

</blockquote>



<hr size="1">



<h4>What

Can We Do?</h4>



<p><b>Because tomorrow's

parents have already been born and the impacts of fertility decline won't be felt for

several decades, the world has to prepare itself to cope with a global population of eight

billion in 2020. </b>Therefore, the measures to be taken must not be confined to the

sole objective of reducing fertility. Some other things we can do are:</p>



<blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li>Preserve the

  dignity of the family and each of its member.</li>
    <li>Reduce consumption of natural resources and consumer goods.</li>
    <li>Give priority to investments in basic health services, sanitation and clean water.</li>
    <li>Make information and education accessible to all, including women.</li>
    <li>Protect women from coercion, maltreatment and sexual violence.</li>

    <p>Over 1.3 billion people

    lack access to safe drinking water, 880 million adults cannot read or write, 770 million

    lack sufficient food for an active working life, and 800 million live in "absolute

    poverty," lacking even the most rudimentary necessities. Each year about 14 million

    children, about 10 percent of the children born annually, die of hunger.</p></li>
