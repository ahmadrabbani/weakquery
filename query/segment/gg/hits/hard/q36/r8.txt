 Can we check population growth? - Sanam's name

Population – a ticking bomb Data released in 2011 census is a wake up call which we need to take and do the needful in curbing our population growth which is eating into all our development resources and pushing us back. Our decadal growth though has declined from 21.54% to 17.64% yet we have added population almost equal to that of Brazil or that of many other countries put together in the past ten years. Our population has increased by 18.1cr. from 102.9cr. as on 2001 to 121cr. in 2011. This is equal to 17.5% of world population while we have a land mass of only 2.4%. This adds to a population density of 382 persons per sq. km. from 325 a decade ago. Thus we are the second most populated country in the world after China. If we continue to go the way we are moving by 2025 we may take over China. Our total fertility rate – the number of children a woman has in her lifetime, which ideally should be 2.1 to keep the population where it is – is 2.68 now down from 3.2 in 1998. 14 states have achieved a fertility rate of 2.1. Kerala and Tamilnadu have done better bringing down to 1.7, while states like Bihar and U P have total fertility rate of 3.9 and 3.8 respectively and these two states account for 30% of our country’s population. It is yet to be seen whether India will go sub-saharan Africa way where average is 6 or more children per woman or stabilize population growth like Thailand where average is 1.8 per woman. It is surprising that neither the govt. nor the political parties are paying any serious attention in checking the growing population. Everyone knows it well that unchecked population growth is pushing us back in our efforts on development and growth. Food security, health, education, unemployment, law and order and infrastructure development are falling short due to increase in population. In mid seventies Sanjay Gandhi did make serious effort on this front, but the implementation of family planning programme was so coercive and poor that it alienated majority of the population that ruling party lost elections and power. Ever since then no party has dared to take up the cause of population control with seriousness it deserves. Sanjay Gandhi had vision that for progress and growth it was necessary to control the population growth and then only fruits of development can be well shared by all. When he took the program, India’s population was around 68cr.as per 1980 census. Had he implemented the programme properly by motivating and educating the people on benefits of small family for them and more resources for the nation, by now after 30 years we would have stabilized our population growth to around 85cr. as recorded in 1990 or at the most to 95cr.? But this did not happen and we continued to breed unchecked. Controlling population is not only tedious but very slow moving process. Any serious efforts made in this direction will have the results if any, visible only after 10 – 15 years. Why the political parties and the govt. do not aggressively check population control? It is political dividends, they reap with growing population. More the population, more the vote bank. More the poor, more the funds required for infrastructure and social programs. More the funds, more the opportunities to swindle. Swindling the funds help in growth of crony capitalism, and multiplication of funds. Without adequate funds one cannot fight elections, strengthen the party, and provide financial security for self and the family. Thus no one wants to pursue the population control program as they find it counter productive to their political cause. The govt. should come out of the haunting memories of mid-seventies and take up population control in mission mode like many other programs. There should be incentives for those restricting themselves to one child norm like China and disincentive for those having more than two children. All states and union territories with the help of central govt. and NGOs should make sincere efforts on war footing to motivate the masses on restricting family size to the laid down norms. Bihar and U P which are high in fertility rate need aggressive approach in this direction. If we take up the program now by the year 2020 we may stabilize our population to around 125-130bn. Let the concerned authorities take it as a wake up call and do something seriously and urgently.
