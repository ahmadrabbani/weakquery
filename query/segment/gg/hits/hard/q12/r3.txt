The last Quagga died in in 1883 in an Amsterdam Zoo.                 Turanian Tiger, Caspian Tiger  Caspian Tigers lived in China, Tajikistan, Iran, Afghanistan and Turkey.  They were hunted for their furs and to protect livestock.  A ban on hunting the Caspian Tiger in the USSR in 1947 followed their greatest destruction in the 1930s.  The last Caspian Tiger reported shot was in 1957.                Steller's Sea Cow  Steller's Sea Cow was discovered in the Aleutian Islands by George Steller while exploring with Vitus Bering in 1741. They grew as large as 35 feet long and weighed up to three-and-a-half tons.    Sailors ate their meat and used their leather.  They were easily killed and vanished from their only home within 30 years after Steller's discovery.               Steller's Sea Cow Drawn by George Steller             Spectacled Cormorant, Pallas' Cormorant  Also discovered in the Aleutian Islands by George Steller while exploring with Vitus Bering in 1741.  The Spectacled Cormorant was extinct within about a century.                      Dodo, Roland Savery In 1505, Portuguese explorers discovered the island of Mauritius and the 50 lb flightless Dodos which supplemented their food stores.  Imported pigs, monkeys and rats fed on the Dodo's eggs in their ground nests.  The last Dodo was killed in 1681.       1           2        3        4        5       6       7       8       9      10      11      12                      Free Woodworking Birdhouse Plans      70 Birds that Nest in Birdhouses      Birds that Nest in Cities     Feeding Birds        About Bird Houses     Building Houses     Platform Designs     Feeder Designs     Nestbox Birds     Platform Birds      Bats                                           70 Birds Nest in Birdhouses Eastern Bluebird Mountain Bluebird Western Bluebird Bufflehead Snow Bunting Catbird Black-capped Chickadee Carolina Chickadee Mountain Chickadee Chestnut-backed Chickadee Brown Creeper Mourning Dove Wood Duck Peregrine Falcon House Finch Northern Flicker Ash-throated Flycatcher Great Crested Flycatcher Common Goldeneye Barrow's Goldeneye Grackle Red-tailed Hawk Blue Jay American Kestrel Purple Martin Common Merganser Hooded Merganser Brown-headed Nuthatch Pygmy Nuthatch Red-breasted Nuthatch White-breasted Nuthatch Osprey Common Barn Owl Barred Owl Boreal Owl Great Horned Owl Hawk Owl Pygmy Owl Eastern Screech-owl Western Screech-owl Northern Saw-whet Owl Black Phoebe Eastern Phoebe Say's Phoebe Pigeon American Robin Yellow-bellied Sapsucker House Sparrow Song Sparrow European Starling Barn Swallow Cliff Swallow Tree Swallow Violet-green Swallow Chimney Swift Brown Thrasher Siberian Tit Plain Titmouse Tufted Titmouse Prothonotary Warbler Downy Woodpecker Golden-fronted Woodpecker Hairy Woodpecker Lewis' Woodpecker Pileated Woodpecker Red-bellied Woodpecker Red-headed Woodpecker Carolina Wren Bewick's Wren House Wren Winter Wren                                                                      National Gallery of Bats       Extinct Thylacine Women's T-Shirt      Extinct Wooly Mammoth Infant-Toddler T-Shirt        Extinct Turtle Kids Light T-Shirt        Extinct Giant Moa Dark T-Shirt        Extinct Pteranodon Fitted T-Shirt        Extinct Great Auk Women's Dark T-Shirt        Extinct Dodo Bib        Mosasaur Infant-Toddler T-Shirt        Extinct Mesosaurus Green T-Shirt      Extinct Hesperornis regalis Kids Dark T-Shirt        Extinct Horned Toxodont Bib      Extinct Phororhacos Kids Baseball Jersey         Extinct Dodo Kids Dark T-Shirt      Extinct Great Auk Kids Hoodie        Extinct Pterodactylus antiquus Fossil Jr. Spaghetti Tank      Extinct Pteranodon Infant-Toddler T-Shirt        Extinct Giant Moa Kids Baseball Jersey        Extinct Dodo Women's Dark T-Shirt       Extinct Dodo Stonewashed Cap
