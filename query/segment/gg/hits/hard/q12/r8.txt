The African country's wildlife conservation authority renewed its fears over the threat of extinction to its animals, with the announcement that numbers of both species are declining. The grevy's, which is the largest species of zebra, is considered endangered as a result of habitat destruction and increased hunting, which has left its estimated population numbers at just 1,500 to 2,000 surviving in the wild. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has already listed the zebra as "endangered"; however, its views differ with KWS' regarding antelope species, which it suggests are "of least concern". Dr Charles Musyoki, senior scientist at KWS, suggested that the IUCN list in "in conflict" with what is actually occurring in Kenya. He told the Daily Nation: "Some of the animals that are quickly dying off within our borders are of least concern according to IUCN. This locks us out of funding from conservation agencies and starves us of the attention needed to be created about these dying species."
