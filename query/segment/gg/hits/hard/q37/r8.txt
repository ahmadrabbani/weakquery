India's railway safety record needs much improvement.        0  0.0/5  2  3  4  5        IN A reply to a RTI application by a Delhi resident, the information officer's replies reveal that the number of railway accidents have decreased substantially over the last decade. Against 2131 accidents in 1960-61, only 61 accidents have taken place till September this year. Five collisions and 28 derailments were reported this year against 130 and 1415 in 1960-61.       Share         A British legacy, Indian Railways is a vital national transportation grid for the country’s 1.2 billion people. It operates 15,000 trains per day, becoming a mode of conveyance for 18 million people daily. Frequent delays, low investment, patchy safety record have marred the national rail carrier.  Some 336 people were killed and 437 injured in rail accidents in India between April 2010 and mid-January 2011, according to the latest government figures. Hundreds of bridges and tracks are awaiting refurbishment despite the fact that every year that Railways returns a huge share of their allocated funds as unutilised funds. Railway safety budget was increased by Rs 700 crore this financial year and the rising safety concerns suggests that the issue lies in fund utilisation. Every year, railways ministers celebrate the increase in the revenues but the moment should have been rather used for analysing the causes behind the loss of precious human lives and property. The railways though seem to have woken up to the harsh reality, as the Union Railway Minister recently announced a high-level committee to give an assessment of the safety issues. The Committee is scheduled to submit its report in three month's time.  Without furnishing the details of the accidents that took place during the tenures of different Ministers, the RTI reply read: “Details regarding consequential train accidents reportable to the Board are not maintained separately for tenure of each minister of Railways who assumed charge in the past.”      Previous Post     Will Rahul's padyatra politics fructify?
