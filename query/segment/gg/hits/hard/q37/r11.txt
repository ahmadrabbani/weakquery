There are approximately 6,000  railroad crossing accidents each year in the United States and often they result in catastrophic injury or death. Nearly 35% of all railway crossing accidents occur to children under 16 years of age. Railway companies are often quick to place the blame on inattentive motor vehicle drivers and children who are looking to "beat the train". Railway companies must be accountable for providing adequate warning systems and safety measures such as safety gates and flashing lights at all railway crossings. If a railroad company has been negligent in providing adequate warning systems you may be able to file a claim to recover your losses including medical expenses, property damage, loss of current and future earnings, loss of future enjoyment and pain and suffering. If you or a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a railroad crossing accident, the  railroad accident attorneys at Wingate, Russotti & Shapiro, L.L.P., would like to meet with you.
