But as the freight accident two weeks ago near Elgin points out, only railroads with really lousy safety records can improve as much as CN claims it has. It had a very long way to go, and a flurry of crashes in the past four years suggests it has a ways more to go. However safer CN becomes as it weaves through the Southland on the old EJ&E trackage it bought, we should never forget a bargain we made as citizens of an industrialized nation. A 1.5-mile-long, 50-mph, 3,000-ton missile limited to a single path of steel rails might derail, blow up, spill and create occasional toxic catastrophes in your back yard. At 50 mph under perfect conditions, it takes more than a mile to stop it. Run-of-the-mill derailments such as the one near Elgin occur every two weeks. Train accidents have recurred more frequently every year since 1997, and technology to prevent such crashes has not changed much for 70 years. Except when there are fatalities, it’s hard to characterize derailments as surprising news. The Federal Railroad Administration reports that there are nearly 13,000 railroad-related accidents every year. Once every 115 minutes, a person or vehicle is hit by a train in the United States.  Our lack of appreciation for this danger makes us generally impervious to warning grades, flashing lights and common sense when it comes to trains. Half of all fatalities occur when motorists ignore warning lights. So at least half the 600 fatalities and 2,300 injuries every year occur because a driver wasn’t paying attention. Freight railroads are mostly self-regulating until they crush a car or spill deadly chemicals. Then the feds investigate and demand some response that shows the railroad will try not to do it again. We’d like to tell you the vigilance of regulators will control these potential catastrophes and make you safer. We could tell you that. But it wouldn’t be true.
