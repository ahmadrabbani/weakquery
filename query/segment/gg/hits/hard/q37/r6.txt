In today’s fast lane world of jets and cars, traveling on a train has become something of a novelty. But in fact, while passenger travel on trains has indeed decreased dramatically in America since the advent of national highways and commercial airline travel after World War II, trains are used more than ever as a high-volume, low-cost way to ship freight and cargo across the country. Because rail lines are built to weave through towns and cities and often cut across major roads and intersections in populated areas, they continue to pose a threat to pedestrians and other people using other forms of transportation. Despite notable efforts to curb railroad and train accidents through improved equipment and higher standards for railway personnel, it is estimated that train accidents still occur at a rate of one every 90 minutes in America. As urban areas continue to build and expand on commuter subway systems, the potential for high speed train wrecks is actually growing. There are several other reasons why train wrecks continue to occur so often. Not all railways are built to handle the speed and size of today’s trains. Because trains are capable of traveling at speeds that exceed 100 mph today, sudden stops or slow downs on the train can cause acceleration/ deceleration injuries or falls and accidents caused by the train’s momentum. The number of train accidents can also be attributed, in part, to increased freight railroad traffic and train density that have reached record high levels since 1980. Many of these accidents could be prevented with proper track maintenance, better worker safety standards and better management of railroad crossings. The havoc caused by train and railway accidents rivals the damage caused in plane wrecks. The few who are fortunate enough to survive these disasters usually face the severest of injuries, such as traumatic brain injury, loss of limbs, and other injuries that cost millions in medical care.
