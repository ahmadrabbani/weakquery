Metrolink commuter trains, intercity trains and Amtrak offer short and long-distance service in the state. Their presence throughout California means that trains are a key form of transit in the state. But it also means that there are a lot of railroad crossings, making car-train accidents a distinct possibility. Other types of crashes involving trains also can cause serious injuries or death. If you’ve been hurt in an accident involving a train, seek the guidance of a qualified personal injury attorney.  Facts about Train Accidents   In the U.S., more than 11,000 accidents or incidents involving trains occurred in 2009. 1,894 of those were reported as actual train accidents. A total of 4 deaths in 2009 were attributed to train accidents. More than 100 “nonfatal conditions” were reported as a result of train accidents. 127 accidents involved passenger trains in 2009. 22 train accidents resulted in hazardous material leaks. In 2009, nearly 2,000 highway-rail incidents caused 250 fatalities.

The Federal Railroad Administration attributes train accidents to a number of primary causes: Human factors Defects in tracks Equipment failure or problems Defects with signals  The agency reports that more than 95% of the fatalities linked to train crashes happen in highway-rail or trespassing incidents. Highway-rail accidents encompass collisions that happen at railroad crossings, and may include motor vehicles or other road or sidewalk users. Trespassing on railroad property leads to death for hundreds of people in the U.S. every year, and the FRA points to California as a leader in such incidents. Across the U.S., someone is struck by a train about every two hours, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is frightening to consider the kinds of injuries that can occur when trains are involved in collisions because an average freight train weighs approximately 12 million pounds. In addition, the average train requires more than a mile of track to come to a stop. Injuries resulting from train accidents may include broken bones, traumatic brain injuries and other head wounds, spinal cord damage, internal organ damage, lacerations, and just about any other type of injury the human body could sustain. The overwhelming size and weight of trains, combined with speed, provides a recipe for disaster where individuals are concerned.
