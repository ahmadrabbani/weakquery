The famous Hubble Space Telescope is certainly one of the most innovative
tools of the astronomers in this decade; the present author is just now 
going to predict (and is convinced it deserves) that it might win the 
title "Photographer of the Decade" for the 1990, as Voyager 2 was 
nominated for the 1980. Its most spectacular results, together with an 
open and intelligent public relations policy of the Space Telescope 
Science Institute, has provided astronomers with a great flood of data 
and high-quality images, and an outstanding popularity, especially as all 
the material gets public domain two years after it was obtained.
<p>
The Hubble results have revolutionized the state of knowledge in virtually
any branch of astronomy -- not that every good result comes from the HST,
but as these data are available publicly, they are used if ever possible;
from planets, comets, and asteroids to stars, clusters, nebulae, and
galaxies, every sort of objects in the sky was investigated, often 
obtaining most revolutionary results.
<p>
Among the most outstanding achievements are observations of objects from
Messier's catalog, as those are outstanding representatives of all types
of Deep-Sky objects.  Because not every author has made his results 
available to the public domain, we cannot present a comprehensive review
here at the moment.  But we have tried to link into our catalog some of 
the most interesting achievements.
<p>
There's but one fact on the Hubble Telescope's optics which must be kept 
in mind: The Hubble telescope has a very long focal length of 190 feet (58 m),
and thus a one degree field measures one full meter in the space telescope's
focal plain, and one arc minute about 1.7 cm.  As its detectors are very much 
smaller, their fields of view are actually small, so that only photos of small 
portions of extended objects like most of Messier's catalog can be obtained.
<p>
Moreover, the Hubble Space Telescope is not only an astronomical instrument
(though the telescope makes up its biggest part) but also a sophisticated
<i>spacecraft</i>. As a spacecraft, it has proven to be very reliable, and was
so well operated that the technological operations did virtually never concern 
the scientific program. 
Indeed, Hubble is one of the more important in a considerably long list of 
<a href="http://www.seds.org/~spider/oaos/oaos.html">orbiting telescopes</a>,
or astronomy satellites.

Here's a list of links to the Hubble observations of Messier objects we
could collect with our pages:

  <a href="http://tycho.la.asu.edu/scowen.html">Paul Scowen</a> of the
  Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, have obtained
  <a href="../more/m001_hst.html">gorgeous images of the Crab Nebula</a>
  with the Hubble Space Telescope. These images have been reproduced 
  previously in <i>Sky and Telescope</i> of January 1995, and have provided 
  some new and significant insight into the internal processes of this 
  supernova remnant. Some <a href="../more/m001_hd.html">views of fine detail</a> 
  have been extracted, which are e.g. suitable for computer screen background.
  On May 30, 1996, <a href="../more/m001_h2.html">new studies</a> of the same

  Moreover, this galaxy is the home of the first 
  <a href="../more/m100_hst2.html">Cepheid variables discovered 
  in the Virgo cluster of galaxies</a>, giving a distance
  of 50-60 million light years, and a Hubble constant of 80+/-17.
  However, with the refinement of the distance scale by ESA's astrometric
  Hipparcos satellite, this value must be refined by about 10 percent, and
  current estimates for H0 are closer to 67+/-7.

  <a href="../more/m105_hst.html">Central Massive Dark Object</a> (January 1997)
</ul>

We know of more good Hubble results concerning Messier objects.
They are listed below, and we would like to get images and more 
information for inclusion here:

<ul>
<li><a href="../m/m081.html">M81</a>: The distance of M81 was determined
  from early HST observations of Cepheid variables. Are these reports, and
  possibly images/data, available online somewhere ?
<li><a href="../m/m095.html">M95</a> was a target within the 
  <a href="http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/H0kp/pren3351.html">
  key project of searching for Cepheid variables in neighboring galaxies</a>.
  We are still looking for Hubble images of this galaxy though.
<li><a href="../m/m101.html">M101</a>: The distance of M101 has been 
  determined as 24 million light years, again with Cepheids.
  A HST image of M101 was in a recent issue of Astronomy magazine.
</ul>

Also, there were older images which are not yet on SEDS, e.g. in the slide
sets of the <i>Astronomical Society of the Pacific</i>, including more 
photos of M42, M77, M87, and others.

If you have info on how these materials can be obtained to include them 
here, please <a href="mailto:spider@seds.org">email me</a>.
