<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recent months have witnessed a whirlwind of diplomatic activity in an effort to find a peaceful
settlement to the Northern Ireland crisis. As the deadline for a negotiated peace process approached both British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern intensified their efforts to broker a deal on the future of
Northern Ireland. Given the fact that the compromise package presented by the talks' chairman, former U.S. Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell helped focus international attention on a crisis that has been going on for years, what
lessons can be learnt from this episode that can assist other peace negotiators resolve long-term crisis? </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first lesson that emerges from the Northern Irish saga is that peace negotiations must be all
inclusive. Unless all the parties concerned in a conflict or crisis are offered the opportunity to participate in peace
negotiations there is no chance that a credible settlement can be found. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Second, certain basic rules of diplomatic engagement must be established and punitive measures
introduced whenever parties to the talks do not abide by the agreed upon framework of the proceedings. It is clear that
this approach assisted in keeping both Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists at the table when the going got tough.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Third, third party interlocateurs must be flexible when interacting with the actors involved in peace
talks. Unless they are perceived as impartial and win the consent of those negotiating early on in discussions it is
better if third parties refrain from becoming involved in the proceedings at all. By going the extra mile both Blair and
Ahern and U.S. special envoy Mitchell won the respect of the silent majority that have been pleading for an end to the
Irish conflict that has claimed the lives of so many people over the years.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourth, the latest chapter in the Northern Irish peace process underlines the importance of hammering
out a peace document - however tentative it may be - as soon it is feasible to do so. This will assist the parties in the
conflict to focus on common ground that already exists between them which will in turn serve as a foundation upon which a
more comprehensive peace treaty can be negotiated. After 22 months of work, the U.S. chairman of multi-party Northern
Ireland peace talks former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell and his aides delivered a 65-page draft peace accord to
the eight participating political parties. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although divisions between Northern Ireland's two biggest parties: the Ulster Unionists on the pro-
British Protestant side and the Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP) on the Irish Catholic side held up talks, the
confidential draft, contained unfilled parentheses and lists of alternatives where undisputed recommendations could go. </
P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that a peace accord has been signed it is essential that the guarantors of the peace deal ensure
that the following sensitive points be respected. The British and Irish governments want Northern Ireland governed
jointly by Protestants and Catholics in an assembly and to cooperate with the Irish Republic via a cross-border council
of lawmakers. But the sticking points that stalled the signing of an historic peace accord centred around how to
structure the proposed assembly and what the relationship would be with the cross-border council. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP insisted to the very end that it wants the assembly to be a strong institution, and it wants
the cross-border council to have equal status with the assembly. The assembly is proposed to have a Cabinet-style
leadership to be open to all major parties, including the Irish Republican Army-allied Sinn Fein, a rival for the SDLP's
Catholic votes. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the Ulster Unionists opposed the formation of a Cabinet and favours a powerless cross-border
council. The unionists want to leave substantial powers with the British Parliament in London, which has governed
Northern Ireland since abolishing its parliament in 1972. Ulster Unionists also denounce the idea that Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams should have a Cabinet seat before both the IRA and UDA turn in their weapons as part of a decommissioning
process. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other issues that delayed a peace breakthrough included a proposed Council of the Isles, which
Protestants propose as a forum for representatives of the British and Irish governments, the proposed Belfast assembly, a
new Scottish parliament and a Welsh assembly. The Protestants see this proposal as having symbolic importance in
demonstrating Ireland's ties to Britain. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One will also have to wait and see how the subject of independent commissions develops. These are to
be chaired by outsiders and formed to deal with issues judged too divisive for Northern Ireland politicians to handle on
their own. These issues include: early paroles for imprisoned members of the IRA and pro-British paramilitary groups,
disarmament of outlawed groups, and reform of Northern Ireland's predominantly Protestant police. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main problem in Northern Ireland continues to be the fear that both Protestants and Catholics have
of being made subservient to each other. The growing Catholic minority wants any settlement to ensure that the
Protestants cannot outvote them within Northern Ireland, or abandon the cross-border aspects of the settlement. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionists, who were instrumental in founding Northern Ireland as a predominantly Protestant
state 77 years ago, fear that Mitchell's plan would give the Irish Republic too much influence in Northern Ireland.
Mitchell, a joint appointee of the British and Irish governments, has overseen the Belfast negotiations since their June
1996 start. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another lesson that emerges from the latest round of Northern Irish peace talks is that opponents of
peace should not be allowed to derail peace negotiations. Across Ireland sectarian killers opposed to the peace talks
have been very active in recent weeks. Such violence is reminiscent of the escalation in bombings that took place across
the Middle East the former Rabin government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority appeared to be on the verge of
reaching a breakthrough. Now that a peace deal has been brokered the Northern Irish must do their utmost to avoid a
repetition of what has happened of late in the Middle East peace process.</P>
