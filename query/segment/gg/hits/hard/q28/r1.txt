Tony Blair meeting Gerry Adams (centre) and Martin McGuinness in his office at the House of Commons in 2007          11:10PM BST 31 Aug 2010  Comments    In 2006, Unionists and Republicans were deadlocked over talks to restore the devolved institutions. Mr Blair says that, to avoid a complete collapse of the process, he sometimes lied to the parties.   He says he took “horrendous” chances in what he was telling each the other had agreed to, stretching the truth, on occasions, “past breaking point”.   Mr Blair admits to “bending and distorting” the truth as prime minister, but says a degree of manipulation and distortion are necessary to govern, and voters accept that. “Politicians are obliged from time to time to conceal the full truth, to bend it and even distort it, where the interests of the bigger strategic goal demand it be done. Without operating with some subtlety at this level, the job would be well-nigh impossible.”   Discussing his approach to the truth, he suggests that, at a deeper level, voters retained trust in him because he was trying to do his best for them.   He says the public discriminate between politicians they do not trust at a superficial level — “ie pretty much all of them” — and those they do not trust at a more profound level.

The Democratic Unionist Party wanted the sides to sit opposite each other, “to show they were still adversaries”, but Sinn Fein wanted everyone to sit next to each other “to show they were partners and equals”.  Mr Blair writes that the deal was done only after a Downing Street official suggested a diamond-shaped table “so they could sit both opposite and with each other”.
