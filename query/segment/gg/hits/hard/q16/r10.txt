FEMA has received 27,207 applications from Alabama residents through its teleregistration line  1-800-621-FEMA (3362) , now operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The TTY number for speech- and hearing-impaired is 1-800-462-7585. Internet registration is available online at  http://www.fema.gov  Federal Coordinating Officer Ron Sherman said that approved funds were being disbursed quickly to applicants, often through direct-deposit or electronic funds transfer. “We are committed to get immediate cash into the hands of people who need it for critical emergency needs,” Sherman said.  State Coordinating Officer Bruce Baughman urged all state residents with disaster damage or loss and evacuees temporarily in the state to register as soon as possible. “Every call brings the possibility of help to individuals and families and also helps our emergency management team identify pockets of unmet needs,” Baughman said.  A brief snapshot of disaster aid in the state since President Bush issued an Emergency Disaster Declaration that declared three Alabama counties, Baldwin, Mobile and Washington eligible for FEMA/state Individual Assistance on August 29 th includes:  Of the $5,195,814 approved,  more than $3.1 million is for Housing Assistance;  Other Needs Assistance totals more than $2.03 million for necessary expenses not covered by other programs;  Fifty-two state/FEMA community relations teams are in the field conducting door-to-door outreach in storm-damaged neighborhoods;  Five Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs) are currently open and assisting disaster victims. In addition to recovery specialists from state and federal agencies, crisis counselors are on hand at each DRC; More than 21,500 requests for housing inspections to assess and verify storm-related damage have been issued. To date 4,388 are complete. Nearly 200 FEMA-contracted inspectors are conducting inspections;FEMA has deployed 726 personnel to assist in response and recovery efforts in the state. A Joint Field Office (JFO) has been established in Montgomery and an Area Field Office in Mobile. These offices serve as an administrative command and control center for state and federal recovery operations;To meet the needs of Alabama residents and displaced evacuees from neighboring Gulf Coast states the state has partnered with FEMA to develop a wide range of possible alternative housing options throughout the state; With the return of power and the lifting of boil water notices in some places, current needs for water and ice have been met.    Future needs are being assessed;  More than 550 truckloads of essential supplies have arrived in the state from logistical centers in the Southeast. Large quantities of Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), infant formula, ice, water, and tarpaulin rolls continue to arrive;  FEMA and the state of Alabama have distributed more than 1.17 million liters of water, 9.7 million pounds of ice, and 1.26 million MREs throughout the disaster area. Trucks are moving supplies from local staging areas to comfort stations and distribution centers; Alternate temporary housing units are being identified and 150 travel trailer units are being deployed for use in Bayou La Batre.    Freight trains are transporting travel trailers from Atlanta for dispersion where needed; As of today, the U.S. Small Business Administration had issued 12,656 applications for long-term, low-interest disaster loans for homeowners, renters and businesses;   Providing aid to individuals and households is only one part of the disaster aid authorized by President Bush on Aug. 29.

The Alabama Department of Transportation is reporting the following road conditions: • ALDOT officials restored both westbound lanes of the Wallace Tunnel this morning, and expect to restore both eastbound lanes later today. The tunnels since Monday have been restricted to one lane in each direction with pumping equipment in the other lanes to expel floodwaters from the ventilation and drainage shafts under the driving surface. • ALDOT officials expect to open the Causeway eastbound by late Friday. The ramp bridge from the U.S. 90 Causeway eastbound onto Interstate 10 eastbound will remain closed for an extended period because five concrete spans must be replaced. These 50‐foot spans were destroyed by storm surge. There is no timeline or cost estimate, but officials will work as quickly as possible to achieve this repair. • State Road 193 – the Dauphin Island Parkway is expected to be fully open by Saturday morning. Crews are repairing washouts and shoulder damage. • The fiber optic cables to the I‐10 traffic information signs sustained major damage. Extensive repairs are necessary and this traffic information system will be out of service for an extended period until repairs are made. • Officials expect to fully open State Road 182 – Beach Road in Gulf Shores by late Thursday evening. • Fort Morgan Road is fully open to traffic with debris cleanup and sand removal continuing in some places. • ALDOT officials continue to urge motorists, especially local traffic, to take the Bankhead Tunnel or the Cochrane‐Africatown USA Bridge as an alternate to the Wallace Tunnels on Interstate 10. • Road conditions are available on the ALDOT web site at www.dot.state.al.us . The call volume to the ALDOT information linehas dropped off during the day on Thursday. Friday will be the last day the information line will be staffed. The toll‐free number is 1‐888‐ 588‐2848, and recorded information still will be available. FERRY DAMAGED; REPAIRS COULD TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS MOBILE – Hurricane Katrina damaged the state’s Fort Morgan Ferry that provides round‐trip passage across Mobile Bay from Fort Morgan to Dauphin Island. State Department of Transportation officials inspected the ferry today. A damage assessment is being conducted to determine the extent of repairs that will be necessary. While the damage assessment is not finished, officials expect it will be at least a few weeks before repairs can be completed. It will be necessary to perform the repairs at a dry‐dock facility. The ferry dock in Fort Morgan also sustained minor damage, but officials say those repairs can easily be made before the ferry repairs can be completed. The repairs consisted of erosion and toppled fences and traffic control barriers. This is the second time in less than a year the ferry service experienced a major disruption because of a hurricane. The ferry only returned to service on June 15 after Hurricane Ivan halted ferry service for about nine months because of extensive damage to the Fort Morgan dock. The Department of Transportation took over in May and repaired the Fort Morgan dock and renovated the ferry in time for the summer season. Ferry operators on Sunday, August 28, carried the ferry to hurricane anchorage at Harrison Brothers Shipyard up the Mobile River. The damage to the ferry was discovered Tuesday, but transportation officials have directed resources toward restoring the surface transportation system until today’s inspection.

As of Tuesday morning, there was wet pavement but no standing water in the tunnel. Vehicles should drive with caution and at reduced speeds through the tunnel. In addition to the tunnel’s fixed pumps, portable pumps have been deployed and will continue operations today. Fire department pumper trucks helped during the night, but have returned to fire protection duties this morning. Officials expect to open the closed lanes later today, restoring the tunnel to two lanes in each direction.  Traffic flow along Interstate 10 is currently light because of a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Mobile, but transportation officials expect Interstate 10 traffic volume to begin increasing after sunrise despite Interstate 10 being closed in Mississippi and flooding in much of downtown Mobile. Authorities in Alabama, Mississippi  and Louisiana are advising evacuees to delay return trips until damage assessments can be conducted and accessibility can be confirmed. Many major routes west of Alabama, including Interstate 10 and U.S. 90 in Mississippi, remain closed.  Alabama transportation officials expect congestion and delays along main routes across southwest Alabama in the coming days, especially in urban areas and along major junctions.  With the Cochrane-Africatown USA Bridge closed after being struck by a barge, ALDOT officials have deployed variable message boards to divert trucks hauling hazardous cargo. Those trucks should use Interstate 65 and State Highway 59 as a detour route. Hazardous cargo and oversized loads are prohibited through the Interstate 10 Wallace Tunnel.

The disaster declaration makes local governments in six counties eligible to apply for federal and state infrastructure assistance: Mobile, Baldwin, Washington, Clarke, Choctaw and Sumter. It also enables individual storm victims in Baldwin, Mobile and Washington counties to apply for federal aid. “I appreciate this quick response from President Bush and the federal assistance that will help Alabama recover as quickly as possible,” said Governor Riley, who requested the disaster declaration Sunday. “This declaration will speed help to Alabamians affected by the hurricane and will help ease the burden on local governments as they respond and recover from this storm.”  “Our State and local emergency management teams will conduct damage assessments to determine if additional counties can be added to this disaster declaration," said Bruce Baughman, Director of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency. “We will also begin working immediately with local officials to assess immediate needs of hurricane victims.”  The Federal Coordinating Officer and staff from the Federal Emergency Management Agency are in the State Emergency Operations Center in Clanton to coordinate the flow of federal assistance. Governor Riley has appointed Alabama Emergency Management Agency Director Bruce Baughman as the State Coordinating Officer to work with federal officials in coordinate recovery measures in the declared disaster area.  Storm victims in Mobile, Baldwin and Washington counties can call the FEMA tele-registration line to apply for assistance at 1-800-621-3362 and for the speech and hearing impaired at 1-800-462-7585.  The presidential declaration for public assistance means federal and state assistance will be available to help local governments in the six counties recover costs for debris removal operations and emergency protective    August 29, 2005  ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE MOBILE, August 29, 2005 – Officials with the Alabama Department of Transportation have closed the Cochrane-Africatown USA Bridge along U.S. 98 in Mobile County until they can conduct a structural assessment for possible damage that may have been caused when the bridge was struck by an oil drilling platform that had broken free in Mobile Bay. ALDOT officials have no word on exactly where the oil drilling platform came from, but sometime shortly after 11 a.m. it apparently broke away from its moorings in Mobile Bay and drifted north until it became jammed under the west end of the bridge’s main span. The bridge will remain closed until ALDOT engineers can conduct an inspection. There is no definitive word as of 1 p.m. whether the bridge has sustained damage, but crews will be en route to the bridge as soon as safe travel is possible. The bridge is the route used for hazardous material to bypass the Wallace Tunnel on Interstate 10. Trucks carrying hazardous material are being detoured up Interstate 65 to Alabama 59 to bypass the closed bridge. Augusst 29 2005 C.

August 28, 2005 - Governor Riley Orders Evacuation for Parts of Mobile and Baldwin Counties    CLANTON – Governor Bob Riley on Sunday ordered the evacuation of residents south of Interstate 10 in Mobile County and in low lying areas of Baldwin County due to the significant threat posed by Hurricane Katrina.  The evacuation for areas in Baldwin County went into effect at 1:00 p.m. and the evacuation order for those south of I-10 in Mobile County went into effect at 1:30 p.m.   “I’ve discussed this with local officials and we’re in agreement that this evacuation is necessary to save lives,” said Governor Riley.  “That’s our number one priority.  The primary threat posed by Hurricane Katrina is going to be flooding from storm surge, so those being evacuated just need to make sure they reach higher ground.  They won’t have to travel as far as they did during hurricanes Ivan or Dennis because that threat was primarily strong winds.”   <>In Baldwin County, the order calls for the evacuation of those on Plash Island, the Fort Morgan peninsula, and all areas south of Fort Morgan Road for Gulf Shores.  The order also calls for the evacuation of those living in Perdido Key and south of Perdido Beach Boulevard.  Those in all low lying and flood prone areas south of I-10 in Baldwin County and those living along the Mobile Bay Area and other water inlets also fall under the evacuation order       (return to top of page)     August 28, 2005 - Governor Riley Declares State of Emergency Due to Approaching Hurricane, Requests Federal Assistance    CLANTON - Governor Bob Riley on Sunday declared an official state of emergency in Alabama due to the imminent threat posed by Hurricane Katrina. The emergency declaration enables the Governor to invoke various emergency preparedness measures including Alabama’s price gouging law.   In addition, Governor Riley also asked President Bush to issue an “expedited major disaster declaration” for six counties in the southwestern part of Alabama as Hurricane Katrina continued its approach. The six counties are:  Mobile, Baldwin, Washington, Clarke, Choctaw and Sumter.  Other counties could be added later. “Based upon current information, these counties are likely to receive the most significant damage in Alabama from the hurricane,” Governor Riley said.   “The state is estimating cost figures in the excess of several million dollars. As soon as conditions allow, the state will be requesting post-disaster damage assessment assistance,” the Governor wrote in his request to the President.   A federal disaster declaration would open up a number of different types of federal resources for the state. Under a federal declaration, storm victims would be able to apply for various types of assistance measures including temporary housing assistance, individual family grants, loans and grants to repair homes and businesses, and disaster unemployment assistance.   Alabama’s price gouging law applies only during times of a state of emergency issued by the Governor.   “Those who engage in price gouging will be punished to the fullest extent of the law,” Governor Riley warned.   Governor Riley and Alabama Emergency Management Agency Director Bruce Baughman have been in close contact with local emergency management officials in counties throughout the state to discuss storm preparations.   (return to top of page)  August 27, 2005 - Governor Riley Briefed on State’s Hurricane Preparation CLANTON – Governor Bob Riley spoke with the governors of Mississippi and Louisiana on Saturday morning after being briefed on the latest track of Hurricane Katrina, which shows the storm missing Alabama. Governor Riley arrived at the state’s Emergency Operations Center in Clanton early Saturday to receive updates from the National Weather Service and various state agencies on their storm preparations.  “The track from the National Weather Service this morning shows Katrina’s most serious impact will most likely be in Louisiana and Mississippi, so I spoke with Governor Barbour and Governor Blanco to let them know Alabama is prepared to offer any assistance their citizens may need,” said Governor Riley. “However, should the hurricane change course and head in our direction, the state of Alabama is ready and prepared to deal with this serious storm. Our agencies are on standby and are closely monitoring this situation.” Governor Riley said decisions about possibly declaring a state of emergency in Alabama and other emergency measures will be made later today as Hurricane Katrina’s course is updated.

CDT  THE PRESIDENT: Well, first I want to say a few things. I am incredibly proud of our Coast Guard. We have got courageous people risking their lives to save life. And I want to thank the commanders and I want to thank the troops over there for representing the best of America.  I want to congratulate the governors for being leaders. You didn't ask for this, when you swore in, but you're doing a heck of a job. And the federal government's job is big, and it's massive, and we're going to do it. Where it's not working right, we're going to make it right. Where it is working right, we're going to duplicate it elsewhere. We have a responsibility, at the federal level, to help save life, and that's the primary focus right now. Every life is precious, and so we're going to spend a lot of time saving lives, whether it be in New Orleans or on the coast of Mississippi.  We have a responsibility to help clean up this mess, and I want to thank the Congress for acting as quickly as you did. Step one is to appropriate $10.5 billion. But I've got to warn everybody, that's just the beginning. That's a small down payment for the cost of this effort. But to help the good folks here, we need to do it.  We are going to restore order in the city of New Orleans, and we're going to help supplement the efforts of the Mississippi Guard and others to restore order in parts of Mississippi. And I want to thank you for your strong statement of zero tolerance. The people of this country expect there to be law and order, and we're going to work hard to get it. In order to make sure there's less violence, we've got to get food to people. And that's a primary mission, is to get food to people. And there's a lot of food moving. And now the -- it's one thing to get it moving to a station, it's the next thing to get it in the hands of the people, and that's where we're going to spend a lot of time focusing.  We've got a lot of rebuilding to do. First, we're going to save lives and stabilize the situation. And then we're going to help these communities rebuild. The good news is -- and it's hard for some to see it now -- that out of this chaos is going to come a fantastic Gulf Coast, like it was before. Out of the rubbles of Trent Lott's house -- he's lost his entire house -- there's going to be a fantastic house. And I'm looking forward to sitting on the porch. (Laughter.)  GOVERNOR RILEY: He'll be glad to have you.  THE PRESIDENT: Out of New Orleans is going to come that great city again. That's what's going to happen. But now we're in the darkest days, and so we got a lot of work to do. And I'm down here to thank people. I'm down here to comfort people. I'm down here to let people know that we're going to work with the states and the local folks with a strategy to get this thing solved.  Now, I also want to say something about the compassion of the people of Alabama and Mississippi and Louisiana and surrounding states. I want to thank you for your compassion. Now is the time to love a neighbor like you'd like to be loved yourselves.  Governor Riley announced the fact that they're going to open up homes in military bases for stranded folks. And that's going to be very important and helpful.  My dad and Bill Clinton are going to raise money for governors' funds. The governors of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama will have monies available to them to help deal with the long-term consequences of this storm.  The faith-based groups and the community-based groups throughout this part of the world, and the country for that matter, are responding. If you want to help, give cash money to the Red Cross and the Salvation Army. That's where the first help will come. There's going to be plenty of opportunities to help later on, but right now the immediate concern is to save lives and get food and medicine to people so we can stabilize the situation.  Again, I want to thank you all for -- and, Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job. The FEMA Director is working 24 -- (applause) -- they're working 24 hours a day.  Again, my attitude is, if it's not going exactly right, we're going to make it go exactly right. If there's problems, we're going to address the problems. And that's what I've come down to assure people of. And again, I want to thank everybody.  And I'm not looking forward to this trip. I got a feel for it when I flew over before. It -- for those who have not -- trying to conceive what we're talking about, it's as if the entire Gulf Coast were obliterated by a -- the worst kind of weapon you can imagine. And now we're going to go try to comfort people in that part of the world.  Thank you. (Applause.)   (return to top of page)       (return to top of page)
