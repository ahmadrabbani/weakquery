<div>One Week After Katrina; Alabama Recovery Gains Momentum</div>
<div><br>
&#8212;One week after Hurricane Katrina&#8217;s slashing winds, torrential rains
and strong coastal surges tossed most of the Gulf Coast region into
disastrous disarray , the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approved nearly $5.2 million in
disaster aid to nearly 3,000 Alabama households. <br>
</div>
<div>FEMA has received 27,207 applications from Alabama residents
through its teleregistration line <b>1-800-621-FEMA (3362)</b>, now
operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The TTY number for speech-
and hearing-impaired is 1-800-462-7585. Internet registration is
available online at <a href="http://www.fema.gov/">http://www.fema.gov</a>
<br>
</div>
<div>Federal Coordinating Officer Ron Sherman said that approved funds
were being disbursed quickly to applicants, often through
direct-deposit or electronic funds transfer. &#8220;We are committed to get
immediate cash into the hands of people who need it for critical
emergency needs,&#8221; Sherman said.<br>
</div>
<div>State Coordinating Officer Bruce Baughman urged all state
residents with disaster damage or loss and evacuees temporarily in the
state to register as soon as possible. &#8220;Every call brings the
possibility of help to individuals and families and also helps our
emergency management team identify pockets of unmet needs,&#8221; Baughman
said.<br>
</div>
<div>A brief snapshot of disaster aid in the state since President Bush
issued an Emergency Disaster Declaration that declared three Alabama
counties, Baldwin, Mobile and Washington eligible for FEMA/state
Individual Assistance on August 29<sup>th</sup> includes:<br>
</div>
<div>Of the $5,195,814 approved, </div>
<div>more than $3.1 million is for Housing Assistance; </div>
<div>Other Needs Assistance totals more than $2.03 million for
necessary expenses not covered by other programs; </div>
<div>Fifty-two state/FEMA community relations teams are in the field
conducting door-to-door outreach in storm-damaged neighborhoods;<br>
</div>
<div>Five Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs) are currently open and
assisting disaster victims. In addition to recovery specialists from
state and federal agencies, crisis counselors are on hand at each DRC;
More than 21,500 requests for housing inspections to assess and verify
storm-related damage have been issued. To date 4,388 are complete.
Nearly 200 FEMA-contracted inspectors are conducting inspections;FEMA
has deployed 726 personnel to assist in response and recovery efforts
in the state. A Joint Field Office (JFO) has been established in
Montgomery and an Area Field Office in Mobile. These offices serve as
an administrative command and control center for state and federal
recovery operations;To meet the needs of Alabama residents and
displaced evacuees from neighboring Gulf Coast states the state has
partnered with FEMA to develop a wide range of possible alternative
housing options throughout the state; With the return of power and the
lifting of boil water notices in some places, current needs for water
and ice have been met. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Future needs are being assessed;<br>
</div>
<div>More than 550 truckloads of essential supplies have arrived in the
state from logistical centers in the Southeast. Large quantities of
Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), infant formula, ice, water, and tarpaulin
rolls continue to arrive;<br>
</div>
<div>FEMA and the state of Alabama have distributed more than 1.17
million liters of water, 9.7 million pounds of ice, and 1.26 million
MREs throughout the disaster area. Trucks are moving supplies from
local staging areas to comfort stations and distribution centers;
Alternate temporary housing units are being identified and 150 travel
trailer units are being deployed for use in Bayou La Batre. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Freight trains are transporting travel trailers from Atlanta for
dispersion where needed; As of today, the U.S. Small Business
Administration had issued 12,656 applications for long-term,
low-interest disaster loans for homeowners, renters and businesses;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Providing aid to individuals and households is only one part of
the disaster aid authorized by President Bush on Aug. 29. Public
Assistance (PA) provides help to state and local governments and
certain qualified non-profit entities to remove debris and provide
reimbursement for emergency protective services such as police
overtime. Joint federal/state PA Preliminary Damage Assessments have
been completed in six declared counties: Baldwin, Clarke, Choctaw,
Mobile, Sumter and Washington. FEMA prepares the nation for all hazards
and manages federal response and recovery efforts following any
national incident. FEMA also initiates mitigation activities, trains
first responders, works with state and local emergency managers, and
manages the National Flood Insurance Program and the U.S. Fire
Administration.&nbsp; FEMA became part of the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security on March 1, 2003</div>

September 2, 2005 -- MOBILE &#8211; Efforts to repair Alabama&#8217;s
transportation infrastructure are<br>
continuing with work going on nearly around the clock since Hurricane
Katrina<br>
made landfall.<br>
The Alabama Department of Transportation is reporting the following road<br>
conditions:<br>
&#8226; ALDOT officials restored both westbound lanes of the Wallace Tunnel<br>
this morning, and expect to restore both eastbound lanes later today.<br>
The tunnels since Monday have been restricted to one lane in each<br>
direction with pumping equipment in the other lanes to expel<br>
floodwaters from the ventilation and drainage shafts under the driving<br>
surface.<br>
&#8226; ALDOT officials expect to open the Causeway eastbound by late<br>
Friday. The ramp bridge from the U.S. 90 Causeway eastbound onto<br>
Interstate 10 eastbound will remain closed for an extended period<br>
because five concrete spans must be replaced. These 50&#8208;foot spans<br>
were destroyed by storm surge. There is no timeline or cost estimate,<br>
but officials will work as quickly as possible to achieve this repair.<br>
&#8226; State Road 193 &#8211; the Dauphin Island Parkway is expected to be fully<br>
open by Saturday morning. Crews are repairing washouts and<br>
shoulder damage.<br>
&#8226; The fiber optic cables to the I&#8208;10 traffic information signs
sustained major damage. Extensive repairs are necessary and this
traffic information system will be out of service for an extended
period until<br>
repairs are made.<br>
&#8226; Officials expect to fully open State Road 182 &#8211; Beach Road in Gulf
Shores by late Thursday evening.<br>
&#8226; Fort Morgan Road is fully open to traffic with debris cleanup and
sand removal continuing in some places.<br>
&#8226; ALDOT officials continue to urge motorists, especially local traffic,
to take the Bankhead Tunnel or the Cochrane&#8208;Africatown USA Bridge as an
alternate to the Wallace Tunnels on Interstate 10.<br>
&#8226; Road conditions are available on the ALDOT web site at<a
 href="http://www.dot.state.al.us/"> www.dot.state.al.us</a>. The call
volume to the ALDOT information linehas dropped off during the day on
Thursday. Friday will be the last<br>
day the information line will be staffed. The toll&#8208;free number is 1&#8208;888&#8208;<br>
588&#8208;2848, and recorded information still will be available.<br>
FERRY DAMAGED; REPAIRS COULD TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS<br>
MOBILE &#8211; Hurricane Katrina damaged the state&#8217;s Fort Morgan Ferry that
provides round&#8208;trip passage across Mobile Bay from Fort Morgan to
Dauphin Island. State Department of Transportation officials inspected
the ferry today. A damage assessment is being conducted to determine
the extent of repairs that will be necessary.<br>
While the damage assessment is not finished, officials expect it will
be at least a few weeks before repairs can be completed. It will be
necessary to perform the repairs at a dry&#8208;dock facility. The ferry dock
in Fort Morgan also sustained minor damage, but officials say those
repairs can easily be made before the ferry repairs can be completed.
The repairs consisted of erosion and toppled fences and traffic control
barriers.<br>
This is the second time in less than a year the ferry service
experienced a major disruption because of a hurricane. The ferry only
returned to service on June 15 after Hurricane Ivan halted ferry
service for about nine months because of extensive damage to the Fort
Morgan dock. The Department of Transportation took over in May and
repaired the Fort Morgan dock and renovated the ferry in time for the
summer season.<br>
Ferry operators on Sunday, August 28, carried the ferry to hurricane
anchorage at Harrison Brothers Shipyard up the Mobile River. The damage
to the ferry was discovered Tuesday, but transportation officials have
directed resources toward restoring the surface transportation system
until today&#8217;s inspection.<br>

ALDOT Issues Travel Advisories for Wallace Tunnel, Cochrane Bridge <br>
MOBILE -- Alabama Department of Transportation officials are advising
that the Interstate 10 Wallace Tunnel is limited to one lane eastbound
and one lane westbound because of pumping operations to keep the tunnel
dry. As of Tuesday morning, there was wet pavement but no standing
water in the tunnel. Vehicles should drive with caution and at reduced
speeds through the tunnel. In addition to the tunnel&#8217;s fixed pumps,
portable pumps have been deployed and will continue operations today.
Fire department pumper trucks helped during the night, but have
returned to fire protection duties this morning. Officials expect to
open the closed lanes later today, restoring the tunnel to two lanes in
each direction. <br>
Traffic flow along Interstate 10 is currently light because of a
dusk-to-dawn curfew in Mobile, but transportation officials expect
Interstate 10 traffic volume to begin increasing after sunrise despite
Interstate 10 being closed in Mississippi and flooding in much of
downtown Mobile. Authorities in Alabama, Mississippi <br>
and Louisiana are advising evacuees to delay return trips until damage
assessments can be conducted and accessibility can be confirmed. Many
major routes west of Alabama, including Interstate 10 and U.S. 90 in
Mississippi, remain closed. <br>
Alabama transportation officials expect congestion and delays along
main routes across southwest Alabama in the coming days, especially in
urban areas and along major junctions. <br>
With the Cochrane-Africatown USA Bridge closed after being struck by a
barge, ALDOT officials have deployed variable message boards to divert
trucks hauling hazardous cargo. Those trucks should use Interstate 65
and State Highway 59 as a detour route. Hazardous cargo and oversized
loads are prohibited through the Interstate 10 Wallace Tunnel. <br>

President Bush Approves Request for Federal Disaster Declaration<br>
Governor Riley Requested Federal Help on Sunday<br>
<br>
&nbsp;CLANTON &#8211; Governor Bob Riley on Monday announced he has received
approval from President Bush for a federal disaster declaration in
response to Hurricane Katrina.<br>
<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><small><small>The disaster declaration
makes local governments in six counties eligible to apply for federal
and state infrastructure assistance: Mobile, Baldwin, Washington,
Clarke, Choctaw and Sumter. It also enables individual storm victims in
Baldwin, Mobile and Washington counties to apply for federal aid.<br>
<br>
&#8220;I appreciate this quick response from President Bush and the federal
assistance that will help Alabama recover as quickly as possible,&#8221; said
Governor Riley, who requested the disaster declaration Sunday. &#8220;This
declaration will speed help to Alabamians affected by the hurricane and
will help ease the burden on local governments as they respond and
recover from this storm.&#8221; <br>
<br>
&#8220;Our State and local emergency management teams will conduct damage
assessments to determine if additional counties can be added to this
disaster declaration," said Bruce Baughman, Director of the Alabama
Emergency Management Agency. &#8220;We will also begin working immediately
with local officials to assess immediate needs of hurricane victims.&#8221; <br>
<br>
The Federal Coordinating Officer and staff from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency are in the State Emergency Operations Center in
Clanton to coordinate the flow of federal assistance. Governor Riley
has appointed Alabama Emergency Management Agency Director Bruce
Baughman as the State Coordinating Officer to work with federal
officials in coordinate recovery measures in the declared disaster
area. <br>
<br>
Storm victims in Mobile, Baldwin and Washington counties can call the
FEMA tele-registration line to apply for assistance at 1-800-621-3362
and for the speech and hearing impaired at 1-800-462-7585. <br>
<br>
The presidential declaration for public assistance means federal and
state assistance will be available to help local governments in the six
counties recover costs for debris removal operations and emergency
protective</small></small></h2>

ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION<br>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
MOBILE, August 29, 2005 &#8211; Officials with the Alabama Department of
Transportation<br>
have closed the Cochrane-Africatown USA Bridge along U.S. 98 in Mobile
County until<br>
they can conduct a structural assessment for possible damage that may
have been caused<br>
when the bridge was struck by an oil drilling platform that had broken
free in Mobile<br>
Bay.<br>
ALDOT officials have no word on exactly where the oil drilling platform
came from, but<br>
sometime shortly after 11 a.m. it apparently broke away from its
moorings in Mobile Bay<br>
and drifted north until it became jammed under the west end of the
bridge&#8217;s main span.<br>
The bridge will remain closed until ALDOT engineers can conduct an
inspection. There<br>
is no definitive word as of 1 p.m. whether the bridge has sustained
damage, but crews<br>
will be en route to the bridge as soon as safe travel is possible.<br>
The bridge is the route used for hazardous material to bypass the
Wallace Tunnel on<br>
Interstate 10. Trucks carrying hazardous material are being detoured up
Interstate 65 to<br>
Alabama 59 to bypass the closed bridge.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">CLANTON &#8211; Governor
Bob Riley on Sunday ordered the evacuation of residents south of
Interstate 10 in Mobile County and in low lying areas of Baldwin County
due to the significant threat posed by Hurricane Katrina.&nbsp; The
evacuation for areas in Baldwin County went into effect at 1:00 p.m.
and the evacuation order for those south of I-10 in Mobile County went
into effect at 1:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve discussed this
with local officials and we&#8217;re in agreement that this evacuation is
necessary to save lives,&#8221; said Governor Riley.&nbsp; &#8220;That&#8217;s our number
one priority.&nbsp; The primary threat posed by Hurricane Katrina is
going to be flooding from storm surge, so those being evacuated just
need to make sure they reach higher ground.&nbsp; They won&#8217;t have to
travel as far as they did during hurricanes Ivan or Dennis because that
threat was primarily strong winds.&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
&lt;&gt;In Baldwin County, the order calls for the evacuation of those
on
Plash Island, the Fort Morgan peninsula, and all areas south of Fort
Morgan Road for Gulf Shores.&nbsp; The order also calls for the
evacuation of those living in Perdido Key and south of Perdido Beach
Boulevard.&nbsp; Those in all low lying and flood prone areas south of
I-10 in Baldwin County and those living along the Mobile Bay Area and
other water inlets also fall under the evacuation order<br>

Approaching Hurricane, Requests Federal Assistance</span></span></span></font>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">CLANTON - Governor
Bob Riley on Sunday declared an official state of emergency in Alabama
due to the imminent threat posed by Hurricane Katrina. The emergency
declaration enables the Governor to invoke various emergency
preparedness measures including Alabama&#8217;s price gouging law.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In addition, Governor
Riley also asked President Bush to issue an &#8220;expedited major disaster
declaration&#8221; for six counties in the southwestern part of Alabama as
Hurricane Katrina continued its approach.<br>
<br>
The six counties are:&nbsp; Mobile, Baldwin, Washington, Clarke,
Choctaw and Sumter.&nbsp; Other counties could be added later.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#8220;Based upon current
information, these counties are likely to receive the most significant
damage in Alabama from the hurricane,&#8221; Governor Riley said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#8220;The state is
estimating cost figures in the excess of several million dollars. As
soon as conditions allow, the state will be requesting post-disaster
damage assessment assistance,&#8221; the Governor wrote in his request to the
President.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">A federal disaster
declaration would open up a number of different types of federal
resources for the state. Under a federal declaration, storm victims
would be able to apply for various types of assistance measures
including temporary housing assistance, individual family grants, loans
and grants to repair homes and businesses, and disaster unemployment
assistance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Alabama&#8217;s price
gouging law applies only during times of a state of emergency issued by
the Governor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#8220;Those who engage in
price gouging will be punished to the fullest extent of the law,&#8221;
Governor Riley warned.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Governor Riley and
Alabama Emergency Management Agency Director Bruce Baughman have been
in close contact with local emergency management officials in counties
throughout the state to discuss storm preparations.</p>

</font>August 27, 2005 - Governor Riley Briefed on State&#8217;s Hurricane
Preparation<br>
CLANTON &#8211; Governor Bob Riley spoke with the governors of Mississippi
and Louisiana on Saturday morning after being briefed on the latest
track of Hurricane Katrina, which shows the storm missing Alabama.
Governor Riley arrived at the state&#8217;s Emergency Operations Center in
Clanton early Saturday to receive updates from the National Weather
Service and various state agencies on their storm preparations.
<p>&#8220;The track from the National Weather Service this morning shows
Katrina&#8217;s most serious impact will most likely be in Louisiana and
Mississippi, so I spoke with Governor Barbour and Governor Blanco to
let them know Alabama is prepared to offer any assistance their
citizens may need,&#8221; said Governor Riley. &#8220;However, should the hurricane
change course and head in our direction, the state of Alabama is ready
and prepared to deal with this serious storm. Our agencies are on
standby and are closely monitoring this situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Governor Riley said decisions about possibly declaring a state of
emergency in Alabama and other emergency measures will be made later
today as Hurricane Katrina&#8217;s course is updated.</p>

Arrives in Alabama, Briefed on Hurricane Katrina<font color="#003399"

Mobile Regional Airport<br>
Mobile, Alabama </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>September 2, 2005 10:35 A.M. CDT </p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, first I want to say a few things. I am
incredibly proud of our Coast Guard. We have got courageous people
risking their lives to save life. And I want to thank the commanders
and I want to thank the troops over there for representing the best of
America. </p>
<p>I want to congratulate the governors for being leaders. You didn't
ask for this, when you swore in, but you're doing a heck of a job. And
the federal government's job is big, and it's massive, and we're going
to do it. Where it's not working right, we're going to make it right.
Where it is working right, we're going to duplicate it elsewhere. We
have a responsibility, at the federal level, to help save life, and
that's the primary focus right now. Every life is precious, and so
we're going to spend a lot of time saving lives, whether it be in New
Orleans or on the coast of Mississippi. </p>
<p>We have a responsibility to help clean up this mess, and I want to
thank the Congress for acting as quickly as you did. Step one is to
appropriate $10.5 billion. But I've got to warn everybody, that's just
the beginning. That's a small down payment for the cost of this effort.
But to help the good folks here, we need to do it. </p>
<p>We are going to restore order in the city of New Orleans, and we're
going to help supplement the efforts of the Mississippi Guard and
others to restore order in parts of Mississippi. And I want to thank
you for your strong statement of zero tolerance. The people of this
country expect there to be law and order, and we're going to work hard
to get it. In order to make sure there's less violence, we've got to
get food to people. And that's a primary mission, is to get food to
people. And there's a lot of food moving. And now the -- it's one thing
to get it moving to a station, it's the next thing to get it in the
hands of the people, and that's where we're going to spend a lot of
time focusing. </p>
<p>We've got a lot of rebuilding to do. First, we're going to save
lives and stabilize the situation. And then we're going to help these
communities rebuild. The good news is -- and it's hard for some to see
it now -- that out of this chaos is going to come a fantastic Gulf
Coast, like it was before. Out of the rubbles of Trent Lott's house --
he's lost his entire house -- there's going to be a fantastic house.
And I'm looking forward to sitting on the porch. (Laughter.) </p>
<p>GOVERNOR RILEY: He'll be glad to have you. </p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: Out of New Orleans is going to come that great city
again. That's what's going to happen. But now we're in the darkest
days, and so we got a lot of work to do. And I'm down here to thank
people. I'm down here to comfort people. I'm down here to let people
know that we're going to work with the states and the local folks with
a strategy to get this thing solved. </p>
<p>Now, I also want to say something about the compassion of the people
of Alabama and Mississippi and Louisiana and surrounding states. I want
to thank you for your compassion. Now is the time to love a neighbor
like you'd like to be loved yourselves. </p>
<p>Governor Riley announced the fact that they're going to open up
homes in military bases for stranded folks. And that's going to be very
important and helpful. </p>
<p>My dad and Bill Clinton are going to raise money for governors'
funds. The governors of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama will have
monies available to them to help deal with the long-term consequences
of this storm. </p>
<p>The faith-based groups and the community-based groups throughout
this part of the world, and the country for that matter, are
responding. If you want to help, give cash money to the Red Cross and
the Salvation Army. That's where the first help will come. There's
going to be plenty of opportunities to help later on, but right now the
immediate concern is to save lives and get food and medicine to people
so we can stabilize the situation. </p>
<p>Again, I want to thank you all for -- and, Brownie, you're doing a
heck of a job. The FEMA Director is working 24 -- (applause) -- they're
working 24 hours a day. </p>
<p>Again, my attitude is, if it's not going exactly right, we're going
to make it go exactly right. If there's problems, we're going to
address the problems. And that's what I've come down to assure people
of. And again, I want to thank everybody. </p>
<p>And I'm not looking forward to this trip. I got a feel for it when I
flew over before. It -- for those who have not -- trying to conceive
what we're talking about, it's as if the entire Gulf Coast were
obliterated by a -- the worst kind of weapon you can imagine. And now
we're going to go try to comfort people in that part of the world. </p>
<p>Thank you. (Applause.) </p>
