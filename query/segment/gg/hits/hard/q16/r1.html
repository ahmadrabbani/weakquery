									<h2>Blast/Projectile - Protective Measures and Design Tools Project</h2>
								
						
					<p><strong>Project Manager: Dr. John Fortune</strong></p><p><strong>Project Overview:</strong>  This project will provide protective measures along with design guidance for protecting the Nation’s most critical infrastructure assets. Protective measures may include mechanisms to reduce blast effects, rapid mitigation and restoration technologies, and other defensive measures. In addition, the project plans to numerically analyze designs against blast and projectile threats and to conduct physical demonstrations to assess their effectiveness. This work will seek to mature and expand existing protective measures by making them less expensive, easier to apply, and more effective, and will develop entirely new materials and design concepts for additional classes of infrastructure. This project is part of the Infrastructure Protection Thrust Area and the Protection and Mitigation Technologies Branch of the <a href="/xabout/structure/gc_1224537470473.shtm">Infrastructure Protection and Disaster Management Division</a>.</p>

									<h2>Geospatial Analytics in Support of Federal Air Marshal Service Project (Formerly, Suspicious Activity Reporting)</h2>
								
						
					<p><strong>Project Manager: Stephen Knox</strong></p><p><strong>Project Overview:</strong> This project develops technologies that will detect, forecast, and disrupt future terrorist attacks and criminal activity – leveraging predictive analytic algorithms and software developed for the Department of Defense community, which successfully ‘predict’ improvised explosive device locations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The system will change the manual review of tens of thousands of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) to an automated system of semantic clustering of SARs to detect hidden trends and patterns, and create real-time statistical models to visually quantify and assess threats to mass transit to enable forecast of tactics and locations of terrorist and criminal activities.  This capability provides the Federal Air Marshal Service with actionable guidance on the most effective location and allocation of agents to place on high risk flights as well as provides them with increased knowledge of the tactics and procedures of the adversary. This project is within the Disaster Management Thrust Area and the Response and Law Enforcement Technologies Branch of the <a href="/xabout/structure/gc_1224537470473.shtm">Infrastructure Protection and Disaster Management Division</a>.</p>

									<h2>Wide Area Surveillance Project</h2>
								
						
					<p><b>Project Manager: Dr. John Fortune</b></p><b>Project Overview:</b> This project investigates novel sensors and systems for use in densely populated infrastructure settings and urban landscapes (e.g., airports, train stations, city streets and squares) to provide continuous surveillance of the Nation’s highest priority infrastructure. This project is developing a prototype wide area surveillance system for persistent surveillance based on high resolution camera technology and innovative data processing, known as the Imaging System for Immersive Surveillance (ISIS). The ISIS system is intended to fill a void in wide-area, persistence surveillance by providing high resolution imagery throughout an entire scene, coupled with detection and video processing algorithms. This project is part of the Infrastructure Protection Thrust Area and the Protection and Mitigation Technologies Branch of the <a href="/xabout/structure/gc_1224537470473.shtm">Infrastructure Protection and Disaster Management Division</a>.
