This project is within the Disaster Management Thrust Area and the Response and Law Enforcement Technologies Branch of the  Infrastructure Protection and Disaster Management Division . Back To Top    Geospatial Location Accountability and Navigation System for Emergency Responders (GLANSER) Project Project Manager: Jalal Mapar  Project Overview: This project develops an advanced first responder locating system. It builds on efforts in previous years by including integrated sensor components and software for visualizing locations and tracks for incident commanders, using building diagrams, floor maps, and office/apartment location; and securely connects to emergency operations centers. GLANSER will enable incident commanders and decision makers to visually track responders to enhance overall situational awareness. This project is part of the Disaster Management Thrust Area and the Response and Law Enforcement Technologies Branch of the  Infrastructure Protection and Disaster Management Division .  Back To Top    Integrated Data Processing and Analysis Project Project Manager: Bruce Baicar  Project Overview: This project provides information sharing capabilities for State and local law enforcement through development efforts with the Automated Regional Justice Information Center (ARJIS) in San Diego, California and the International Justice and Public Safety Network (Nlets). This project develops scalable technologies for the integrated analysis of free text, database records, audio, video, imagery, transactional data, geographical data, and sensor information. This project will develop new visual analytic techniques for an officer’s environment whether he or she is in the office, using a mobile appliance, or working at a large wall-mounted touch screen. This provides all officers with the same tools regardless of where they are, while at the same time allowing customization based on user and context. This approach promotes easy integration into many regional law enforcement agencies and ready adoption into their operational environments. Research for Nlets will enhance officer safety by providing a variety of methods to help identify known criminals.

Traditional transformers are very large, making them difficult to transport, mostly manufactured overseas and can have significant procurement delays. This project will provide a capability to increase the resiliency of the power grid. This project is part of the Infrastructure Protection Thrust Area and Structural Resilience Program of the  Infrastructure Protection and Disaster Management Division . Back To Top    Resilient Electric Grid Project Project Manager: Sarah Mahmood  Project Overview:  This project will develop technology that will enable the interconnection of power substations to share power and assets and increase resiliency, while eliminating the concern of potentially dangerous fault currents. The existing electric grid is highly susceptible to brownouts and blackouts. The Nation needs to “keep the lights on” in the event of a terrorist attack, weather, etc. to protect key sectors of the economy and the public. The project will develop an inherently fault current limiting, high temperature superconducting (IFCL-HTS) cable for electric grid resiliency. This cable will help the electric utilities manage fault currents that can cause cascading blackouts and permanent damage to electrical equipment, potentially saving billions of U.S. dollars annually, while allowing for advances in traditional operation by connecting substations together so utilities can share assets and capacity and increase redundancies in the system. This project is part of the Infrastructure Protection and Structural Resilience Technology Branch of the of the  Infrastructure Protection and Disaster Management Division .

Back To Top    Sport-Evac Simulation Project Project Manager: Mike Matthews  Project Overview:  This project is being developed and tested by the National Center for Spectator Sports Safety & Security (NCSS) at the University of Southern Mississippi (Southern Miss), which is part of the Southeast Region Research Initiative (SERRI). Southern Miss developers are creating virtual, three-dimensional “e-stadiums”, with up to 70,000 avatars—animated human agents programmed to respond to threats. The simulation includes stadium workers,  first responders , and objects, such as a fire truck or a fans car, and generates scenarios both probable and improbable. By simulating how sports fans would behave in the minutes following an attack, SportEvac will help security experts across the country plan, train, and answer key questions: How can the stadium be evacuated in the shortest time? How can civil emergency workers quickly get in as fans are dashing out? How can stadium guards and ushers provide valuable information to first responders and assist them as the evacuation unfolds? This project is part of the Infrastructure Protection and Protection and Mitigation Technologies Branch of theof the  Infrastructure Protection and Disaster Management Division .  Back To Top    Standard Unified Modeling Mapping Integrated Toolkit (SUMMIT) Project Project Manager: Jalal Mapar  Project Overview:  This project  allows emergency preparedness and management personnel to easily and rapidly discover, integrate, configure, execute, and view the results of the Nation’s modeling and simulation resources and related data. The SUMMIT tool is the principle component of the Integrated Modeling, Mapping, and Simulation (IMMS) program.  The IMMS program is enhancing the use of science-based tools for the emergency preparedness and management community. By creating an environment that allows linking of “best-in-class” modeling and simulation tools and underlying data, IMMS aims to decrease the time and cost needed to train for, analyze, and respond to real or potential incidents—while increasing preparedness effectiveness.

This project is part of the Infrastructure Protection Thrust Area and the Protection and Mitigation Technologies Branch of the  Infrastructure Protection and Disaster Management Division . Back To Top    Unified Incident Command and Decision Support (UICDS) Project Project Manager: Michael Smith/Lawrence Skelly  Project Overview:   UICDS is a national “middleware foundation” designed to support information sharing for the  National Response Framework (NRF) and the National Incident Management System, including the Incident Command System. UICDS middleware is transparent to emergency management system users during operation and requires no special training. It shares data across applications on a wide variety of emergency response hardware, as it is built around data standards and the National Information Exchange (NIEM). It enables information sharing between incident command systems and multi-agency coordination that provide common situational awareness and decision support during all types of incidents. UICDS enables multiple responding organizations (using their own equipment) to jointly manage personnel, direct equipment, and seamlessly communicate, gather, store, redistribute, and secure any mission-critical information needed by incident commanders and emergency responders during an emergency situation.
