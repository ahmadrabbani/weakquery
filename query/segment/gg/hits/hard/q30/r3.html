people died when Pan Am 103 was blown out of the sky over Lockerbie, Scotland 
on December 21, 1988. It was the worst-ever act of airline terrorism against the 
United States. It's also been called the world's biggest unsolved murder.</font></i> 
<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Finally, after 11 years 
of investigation, political stalemate, and legal delays, two Libyan men prepare 
to face trial for the Lockerbie bombing starting May 3, 2000, in the Netherlands.</i> 
</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>But many observers - 
including legal and law enforcement officials close to the case - say the trial 
may not produce a satisfying answer to the question of who bombed Pan Am 103.</i></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>In this special report, 
journalists Ian Ferguson and John Biewen of American RadioWorks explore the case 
against the Libyans - its strengths and weaknesses.</i></font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> They also examine the 
evidence against other suspects, most notably the Iranian government and a terrorist 
group based in Syria. Some experts, and people who lost loves ones on Pan Am 103, 
question whether the most likely culprits are going on trial. </i> </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Pan Am 103 climbed into 
the dark English sky at 6:25 in the evening on December 21, 1988. It headed northwest 
from London's Heathrow Airport toward Scotland and the North Sea and, ultimately, 
scheduled destinations in New York and Detroit. The Jumbo Jet carried 259 passengers 
and crew. The majority were Americans, many of them returning for holiday gatherings 
with family and friends. But just 38 minutes into the flight, as the 747 cruised 
at 31,000 feet over the border from England into Scotland, something in the cargo 
hold exploded. It blew a hole the size of a large dinner plate in the airliner's 
skin. The loss of air pressure caused a powerful rush that broke the plane to 
pieces. Six miles below, in the Scottish border town of Lockerbie, a woman looked 
up at the sky. </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There was this absolutely 
massive sort of red glow in the sky that went firstly upwards and then out,&quot; 
the woman told a TV interviewer later that night. &quot;We thought it was some 
sort of, like, nuclear explosion.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But then things began to 
fall like violent rain from some nightmare: airplane parts, suitcases and their 
contents, packages gift-wrapped for the holidays. Tons and tons of aviation fuel. 
And people. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In one Lockerbie neighborhood, 
a 60-foot section of fuselage, with 60 bodies inside, landed between two rows 
of houses, miraculously missing them all. Across town a jet engine the size of 
a small truck landed like a small meteor in the parking lot of an apartment building, 
leaving a crater but injuring no one. Bodies rained on a golf course. Amid the 
near-misses, one tragic strike: a wing of the 747 fell directly on three houses, 
creating a fireball that burned so hot it vaporized the homes and the eleven people 
inside them. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Families </b></font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 270 dead, and at least 
that many families devastated by the loss of loved ones. 189 of the victims were 
Americans - more than died later in the 1994 Oklahoma City bombing. </font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;You are, you know, 
permanently changed in some ways,&quot; says Paul Hudson, a New York lawyer whose 
16-year-old daughter, Melina, died on Pan Am 103. Melina was a high-school exchange 
student on her way home from Exeter. For her father, as for many other victims 
of the Pan Am bombing, Lockerbie became an obsession. Paul Hudson now runs the 
Aviation Consumer Action Project, a non-profit group devoted to improving airline 
safety and security. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Across the Atlantic, in 
the English Midlands, parents of another young victim were equally devastated. 
Flora Swire was a gifted and vivacious 23-year-old medical student flying to New 
York to visit her American boyfriend when she died on Pan Am 103. &quot;We would 
like to know before we die the background and the reason and who did this terrible 
crime,&quot; says Flora's mother, Jane Swire. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Mrs. Swire is a soft-spoken 
woman who gives few interviews, but her husband Jim has waged an 11-year public 
campaign to keep Lockerbie in the public eye and bring the bombers to justice. 
Swire recently left his medical practice in order to attend the trial in the Netherlands 
full-time. </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's like, for us, 
any other murder would be,&quot; he says. &quot;Somebody has murdered our daughter. 
Brutally, premeditated murder, a horrible death. Can you imagine being hurled 
into the sub-zero, dark skies over Lockerbie, with a gale raging ...? Someone 
should be brought to justice for that.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>At Last, a Trial </b></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many families of Pan Am 
103 victims hope justice is finally coming. The trial of two alleged members of 
the Libyan Intelligence Service is scheduled to start in May, 2000. The defendants, 
Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, are in custody at a former US 
air base in the Netherlands. The unusual plan to hold the trial in a neutral country 
was agreed to last year by Scotland, the US, and Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi. 
The trial will be held in Holland but under Scottish law before a panel of three 
Scottish judges. The defendants insist they're innocent. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The investigation that 
produced the charges against the Libyans was a joint effort by British and American 
authorities. Current government officials in the two countries won't discuss Lockerbie; 
British law forbids public discussion of a pending criminal case, and the US Justice 
Department says the indictment of the two Libyans speaks for itself. Several former 
investigators who worked on the case say the evidence against the Libyans is solid. 
</font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I believe it is an 
absolutely airtight case,&quot; says former FBI Assistant Director Oliver &quot;Buck&quot; 
Revell, who oversaw that agency's Lockerbie investigation until 1991. &quot;The 
panel of judges will clearly see that the evidence is compelling and overwhelming 
and could only lead to one conclusion.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The conclusion, according 
to the indictment: that on the morning of December 21, 1988, the two Libyans entered 
Luqa airport on the Mediterranean island of Malta. They placed a brown Samsonite 
suitcase, with a bomb hidden inside, on an Air Malta jet bound for Frankfurt. 
That suitcase was then transferred to Pan Am flights in Frankfurt and London before 
blowing up over Lockerbie. Libyan leader Qadhafi is not named in the indictment, 
but former investigators say they believe he personally ordered the bombing of 
Pan Am 103. </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There's a lot of 
evidence, as well as intelligence ... which indicates that the regime was involved,&quot; 
says David Shayler, who headed the Libya Desk for Britain's intelligence service, 
MI5, in the mid-1990s. Qadhafi's motive, according to Shayler: revenge. In April, 
1986, two-and-a-half years before the downing of Pan Am 103, US warplanes bombed 
Libya's two largest cities, Tripoli and Benghazi, to punish Qadhafi for alleged 
terrorist attacks in Europe. An estimated 100 Libyans died in the attack, including 
Qadhafi's 2-year-old adopted daughter.</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Skeptics</b></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among law enforcement and 
legal experts who've looked closely at the Lockerbie case, there's an array of 
skeptics who question that the Libyans are the real culprits, or the most important 
ones. Those skeptics include several of the United Kingdom's top legal experts, 
and the Maltese and German governments. Malta and Germany are the other two countries 
where the bomb that destroyed Pan Am 103 allegedly traveled before blowing up 
over Britain. Neither government subscribes to the charge against the Libyans. 
</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Another prominent skeptic 
is Noel Koch, who headed anti-terrorism efforts for the US Defense Department 
from 1981 to 1986 and still works on contract for the US State Department as an 
anti-terrorism expert. &quot;It was decided by the two governments, by the United 
States and the United Kingdom, that Libya had been responsible for the bombing 
of Pan Am 103,&quot; Koch says. &quot;I have never believed that, and I don't 
believe the case will stand against the Libyans.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The real bombers, in Koch's 
view? &quot;My own conviction from the outset was that the Syrians and Iranians 
were pre-eminently responsible for this.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Back in the early years 
of the Lockerbie case, British and American investigators seemed to share that 
conviction. In 1989 and 1990, Lockerbie investigators were talking with near-certainty, 
not about a Libyan plot, but one by another set of suspects: the Iranian government 
headed by Ayatollah Khomeini, and a Syria-based terrorist organization headed 
by a notorious terrorist named Ahmed Jibril. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Early Suspects: Iran and Syrian 
Terrorists</b></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because Pan Am 103 blew 
up over British soil, and the jet and most of its passengers were American, the 
United Kingdom and United States teamed up to lead the enormous international 
investigation - arguably the largest criminal investigation in history. Those 
on the ground in Scotland faced a huge and painstaking job: gathering and sorting 
tons of potential evidence scattered by the explosion and the wind across more 
than 800 square miles of countryside. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> While Scottish police launched 
into that task, early suspicion focused on one radically anti-American government: 
Iran. Officials thought it likely that the government of Ayatollah Khomeini had 
sponsored the bombing, and that Ahmed Jibril and his Syria-based terrorist organization, 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC), 
had carried it out. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The evidence for that scenario 
did seem compelling, starting with a fresh motive, and a direct threat less than 
six months before the destruction of Pan Am 103. During a tense skirmish with 
Iranian gunboats in the Persian Gulf, the navy cruiser USS Vincennes shot down 
an Iranian passenger jet, which was carrying pilgrims to Mecca. 290 Iranians died. 
The US military insisted the shoot-down was a tragic mistake. But Iran's Islamic 
fundamentalist leaders promised to &quot;retaliate to the maximum,&quot; and to 
&quot;avenge the blood of our martyrs.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> And the Ayatollah's government 
meant it, according to former intelligence officials. Top figures in the Iranian 
government held a series of meetings in Beirut with leaders of Ahmed Jibril's 
terror group, the PFLP-GC, says Vincent Cannistraro, the CIA's chief of counter-terrorism 
at the time. &quot;There was a conclusion made in the intelligence community that 
the Iranians were intending to sponsor the PFLP-GC's operations to attack American 
targets as part of a revenge operation,&quot; Cannistraro says. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Following its meetings 
with Iranian officials, Cannistraro says, the PFLP-GC set up a bomb-making operation 
centered in the West German town of Neuss. But the West German government was 
watching. In October, 1988, two months before Pan Am 103 exploded, the German 
federal police launched what they called Operation Autumn Leaves: they raided 
more than a dozen homes and businesses, rounding up seventeen men, including several 
high-ranking associates of PFLP-GC leader Ahmed Jibril. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> They also found Semtex 
plastic explosive and a barometric detonator designed to go off at high altitude 
&oacute; an airplane bomb. It was packed in a Toshiba cassette recorder called 
a Bombeat. The man who allegedly built the bomb had been surveilled carrying a 
brown Samsonite suitcase, according to West German police documents. Police jailed 
two leaders of the bomb-making group, but a judge ordered the rest released. Still, 
the West Germans boasted they'd successfully broken up a terrorist plot. Until 
two months later, when Pan Am 103 blew up over Lockerbie. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Forensic investigators 
in Lockerbie determined that the bomb had been hidden in a cassette player and 
suitcase similar to those seized from the PFLP-GC in Germany: a Toshiba Bombeat 
and a brown Samsonite. The focus on the PFLP-GC intensified a couple of months 
later. The man who admitted building bombs for the group, Marwan Khreesat, turned 
up in Amman, Jordan. Khreesat told authorities that while in Germany he'd built 
<i>five</i> bombs, not just the one the police had seized. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In the spring of 1989, 
West German police went back to Neuss to search for the four remaining bombs. 
At the apartment of the fruit merchant they found three. And the bombs were wired 
and ready: one blew up and killed a police technician. Still, one bomb went unaccounted 
for. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Cannistraro, then head 
of the CIA's Lockerbie investigation, says authorities focused on the likelihood 
that Marwan Khreesat's fifth bomb had blown up the Pan Am 747 over Lockerbie. 
&quot;The immediate feeling was: we've missed someone. That someone in that [PFLP-GC] 
cell had escaped with one of the explosive devices and succeeded in planting it 
on Pan Am 103.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Investigation Turns</b></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the early consensus 
that the Jibril group and the Iranian government had conspired to blow up Pan 
Am 103, many experts and relatives of Pan Am 103 victims were stunned when British 
and American officials finally announced an indictment in the fall of 1991. The 
joint indictment by Scottish and American authorities named only the two Libyans, 
Megrahi and Fhimah. Officials of the two governments said that while the evidence 
against Iran and the Jibril group had seemed powerful at first, it simply did 
not stand up. According to a US State Department fact sheet explaining the turn 
in the investigation: </font> 
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was discovered 
in June 1990 that the Pan Am 103 bomb had been activated by a sophisticated electronic 
timer, in contrast to the PFLP-GC bombs, which had altimeter switches and relatively 
crude timers. </font> </blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The State Department also 
said that, on closer inspection, the Toshiba Bombeat cassette player that housed 
the Lockerbie bomb differed from the Toshiba Bombeat used by the PFLP-GC; one 
had stereo speakers, the other mono. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Some relatives of victims 
said those seemed like flimsy reasons to absolve Iran and Syria. Notably, the 
skeptics also included the man once in charge of the CIA's Lockerbie investigation, 
Vincent Cannistraro, who retired in late 1990, a year before the indictments. 
</font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The US Justice Department 
... contends that these were two separate independent operations both targeted 
against an American airliner but independent of each other and not known to each 
other - two separate tracks if you will,&quot; Cannistraro says. &quot;That's 
always seemed a bit difficult to accept, that two major terrorist groups were 
targeting the same airliner out of the same location, Frankfurt, Germany, at the 
same time.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> And that both hid their 
bombs in Toshiba Bombeat cassette players and placed them in brown Samsonite suitcases. 
</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Nonetheless, Cannistraro 
says he is persuaded that the Libyans are guilty. He says Qadhafi's government 
was in touch with the PFLP-GC and had, in fact, subsidized the group. But Cannistraro 
says he's convinced Qadhafi's men were hired to finish the Pan Am bombing only 
after the West German police broke up the PFLP-GC's operation. &quot;I do think 
the Libyans carried it out. But I believe more it was a hand-off from the PFLP-GC 
after their own operational cell was compromised.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> So, who conspired to bomb 
Pan Am 103? Iran, Syria, the PFLP-GC, or the Libyans? Cannistraro's answer is: 
maybe all of the above. But the Lockerbie indictment of 1991 pointed the finger 
only at the Libyans. In a comment shortly after the indictment, President Bush 
explicitly exonerated Damascus. &quot;The Syrians took a bum rap on this,&quot; 
Bush said. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> US and British officials 
said that new evidence turned investigators away from Iran and Syria and toward 
Libya. In the years since the indictment, several news organizations and legal 
experts have suggested the evidence against the Libyans appears strikingly weak. 
Others advise caution about drawing such conclusions prior to trial. &quot;We 
haven't yet heard one word of testimony, and it's always very easy to debunk evidence 
in advance of a trial,&quot; says John Grant, until recently a dean at Glasgow 
University Law School. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> That said, a close look 
at the evidence that investigators <i>have </i>touted over the years suggests 
the prosecution case may be flawed.</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Timer </b></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In announcing the indictment 
of the Libyans in 1991, officials said they began looking at Libya in earnest 
after the discovery of a tiny fragment of plastic circuit board. They said it 
was found in the Kielder forest east of Lockerbie. The fragment, no bigger than 
a child's fingernail, was part of the timing device that triggered the bomb, forensic 
experts concluded. And eventually, investigators said, the timer led straight 
to the Libyan government. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Among the mysteries surrounding 
the fragment is how, when, and by whom it was found. &quot;A lover and his lass&quot; 
found the fragment while strolling in the forest, according to one police source 
close to the case. A man found the fragment while walking his dog, according to 
another version. Or, in yet another story from a former investigator, police found 
it while combing the ground on their hands and knees. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In any case, an FBI forensic 
specialist named Tom Thurman was publicly credited with figuring out the fragment's 
evidentiary importance. Thurman, who then worked in the FBI's Washington DC laboratory, 
told ABC News in 1991 that he'd matched the Lockerbie timer fragment with one 
confiscated in West Africa from Libyan agents. &quot;When that identification 
was made, of the timer, I knew that we had it,&quot; Thurman told ABC in 1991. 
Thurman's feelings about his discovery? &quot;Absolute, positively euphoria. I 
was on cloud nine.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But Thurman was later discredited 
as a forensic expert. A 1997 report by the Justice Department's Office of the 
Inspector General found that in a number of cases other than Lockerbie, Thurman 
re-wrote lab reports, making them more favorable to the prosecution. The report 
also recommended Thurman be reassigned to a non-scientific job because he lacked 
a background in science. </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;He's very aggressive, 
but I think he made some mistakes that needed to be brought to the attention of 
FBI management,&quot; says Frederic Whitehurst, a former FBI chemist who worked 
alongside Thurman for 12 years and filed the complaints that led to the Inspector 
General's report. Based on his observations of work done by Thurman and others 
in the FBI lab, Whitehurst says he concluded that &quot;We're not necessarily 
going to get the truth out of what we're doing here.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Tom Thurman is out of the 
FBI now; he's teaching in Kentucky. He says Scottish prosecutors and the Justice 
Department have asked him not to do interviews. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Thurman is just one of 
the problems prosecutors will face in presenting the timer fragment. Another is 
the man who allegedly made and sold the timer. At the press conference announcing 
the indictment in 1991, then-Acting Attorney General William Barr said of the 
fragment: &quot;Scientists determined that it was part of the timing device and 
traced it to its manufacturer, a Swiss company that had sold it to a high-level 
Libyan intelligence official.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Behind the scenes though, 
Edwin Bollier, a partner in the Zurich-based electronics company, MEBO, was telling 
a different story. In 1990 police had shown him a photograph of the circuit-board 
fragment. He agreed that it had come from a circuit board made by his company 
- a model MST-13. At first Bollier told investigators he'd sold MST-13 timers 
only to the Libyan government. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Swiss businessman, 
however, soon changed his story. He said an employee had reminded him that he'd 
sold several prototypes of the MST-13 to an institute in Bernau. This institute 
acted as a front for the former East German secret police, the Stasi. The Stasi 
were known suppliers and supporters of terrorist groups, including Ahmed Jibril's 
PFLP-GC, the Syria-based group first suspected in Lockerbie. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Early in 1991, months before 
the Lockerbie indictments, Bollier told Scottish investigators that from a photograph 
alone he couldn't tell from which batch the timer fragment had come. He made repeated 
requests to examine the fragment itself, in person. Scottish authorities said 
no, citing &quot;the need to protect the integrity of the evidence,&quot; as police 
put it in a letter to Bollier. In November, 1991, Scottish and American officials 
indicted the Libyans, citing the timer fragment as a key piece of evidence, without 
ever having allowed Bollier to examine the fragment up close. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bollier says he now knows 
why: his conclusion, he claims, would not have suited the case the British and 
American governments were building. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 1998 Bollier obtained 
what he says is a blown-up photograph of the printed circuit (PC) board fragment 
that Thurman showed ABC in 1991. Bollier describes the fragment's unfinished edge 
and a white line with wavy edges that he says proves it was made by hand and a 
not a machine. &quot;This fragment of PC board is from a prototype timer,&quot; 
Bollier says. &quot;It was made by Mr. Lumpert, an engineer here in our labs. 
Two of these PC boards eventually became complete timers, and these two I took 
to what at the time was East Germany.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In other words, Bollier 
insists, Thurman's fragment perhaps should have strengthened the case against 
the Syria-based terrorists, the PFLP-GC. It should never have pointed investigators 
toward Libya at all. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Former CIA official Cannistraro 
concedes that Bollier sold MST-13 prototypes to the Stasi. He simply dismisses 
Bollier's claim that the timer that triggered the Pan Am 103 bomb was part of 
that batch. Don't trust Bollier, Cannistraro says. The Swiss merchant not only 
had business with the Libyan government, he once rented office space in Zurich 
to one of the Pan Am 103 defendants, Abdelbaset Megrahi, an alleged Libyan intelligence 
agent. &quot;Given the fact that [Bollier] has an investment with the Libyans, 
he's been a supplier of devices that are only used for lethal purposes, and the 
fact that he has provided cover facilities for Libyan intelligence, I don't know 
how much you can believe Mr. Bollier,&quot; Cannistraro says. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The hostile relationship 
between Bollier and Lockerbie investigators took a bizarre turn in September of 
1999. With a trial finally approaching, the Scottish prosecutors who had refused 
for eight years to show Bollier the circuit board fragment suddenly invited him 
to Scotland. As Bollier tells it, a prosecutor, surrounded by four policemen, 
brought in the fragment in an unmarked plastic sleeve and placed it before him 
on a table. He says he'd brought his own magnifying glass. &quot;I was surprised 
at how small it was....&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bollier says the fragment, 
just two millimeters by three in size, was different from the one the FBI displayed 
on television back in 1991. This one, he claims, was machine-made, like the ones 
he sold to the Libyan government, but now had a new problem: it didn't show traces 
of solder, which Bollier says should have been present if an electrical relay 
had ever been attached to the circuit board. In other words, he says, the fragment 
could never have been used in a bomb. </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As far as I'm concerned, 
and I told this to [Scottish Prosecutor Miriam Watson], this is a manufactured 
fragment,&quot; Bollier says. &quot;A fabricated fragment, never from a complete, 
functional timer.&quot; Bollier insisted on making a written statement to that 
effect; the statement was signed by Scottish police witnesses. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The next day, Bollier says, 
prosecutors brought out the fragment again. This time, he says, it <i>had</i> 
the soldering traces you'd expect on a used timer. Bollier switches to English 
to drive home his point, that the soldering points had apparently been added overnight. 
&quot;It was different. I'm not crazy. It was different!&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bollier demanded to make 
another written statement saying that the timer fragment had been tampered with 
during his visit to Scotland. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At the Lockerbie trial 
the Scottish judges will have to sort out the charges and counter-charges with 
the help of forensic scientists. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Former Lockerbie investigators 
insist that at trial, the evidence will show the Libyan government bought the 
timer that blew up Pan Am 103. But sources close to the Libyans' lawyers say the 
defense team isn't worried about the timer. Even if the Libyan government did 
buy the timer in 1985, the defense will argue, that does not directly link the 
two Libyan defendants to the bomb that destroyed the Pan Am jet three years later. 
</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Independent legal experts 
agree. To get a conviction, they say, Scottish authorities must prove something 
much more specific: that the defendants themselves, Megrahi and Fhimah, planted 
the bomb that killed those 270 people. The indictment suggests that most of the 
evidence for that charge is in Malta. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Malta Connection </b></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The tiny island of Malta 
sits in the southern Mediterranean, south of Sicily and less than 200 miles off 
the coast of Libya. In 1988, both of the Libyan defendants lived and worked on 
the island as managers for Libyan Arab Airlines. To convict the pair, prosecutors 
must show that the bomb that blew up Pan Am 103 started its deadly journey in 
Malta, and that Megrahi and Fhimah themselves conspired to build or acquire the 
bomb and place it on Air Malta Flight 180 on the morning of December 21, 1988. 
</font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Air Malta Flight 180 </b></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At the time of the Pan 
Am 103 bombing, Abdelbaset Megrahi was Station Manager for Libya Arab Airlines 
at Malta's Luqa airport. The other defendant, Fhimah, had been head of security 
for the Libyan airline until September of 1988, when he left his airport job to 
begin launching a travel-related business of his own. The conspiracy charge against 
the pair says all of their jobs were covers for their real work with the JSO, 
the Libyan Intelligence Service. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The indictment says that 
on the morning of the 21 December, 1988, the two men placed aboard Air Malta Flight 
180, from Malta to Frankfurt, a brown Samsonite suitcase containing the bomb that 
ultimately blew up Pan Am 103. The prosecution will argue that the deadly suitcase 
was then transferred as unaccompanied baggage, first to Pan Am Flight 103A at 
Frankfurt, then to Flight 103 at London, before blowing up over Lockerbie. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Some terrorism experts 
argue that that scenario is implausible on its face. One such skeptic is Noel 
Koch, who headed the US Defense Department's anti-terrorism efforts from 1981 
to 1986. Sophisticated Middle East terrorists who wanted to blow up a plane over 
the North Atlantic, Koch insists, would not plant their bomb nearly a thousand 
miles away and rely on two successful luggage transfers by airline workers. </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I can tell you this 
much that I know about terrorism: it's simple,&quot; Koch says. &quot;You don't 
complicate life. Life's complicated enough as it is. If you've got a target you 
want to get as close as you can to it and you don't go through a series of permutations 
that provide opportunities for failure, that provide opportunities for discovery. 
It doesn't work that way.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A former British Intelligence 
official disagrees. &quot;You could say there is good reason for putting up a 
bomb suitcase on three planes, because it makes it that much more difficult to 
trace,&quot; says David Shayler, who headed the Libya Desk for MI5 in the mid-1990s. 
</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The challenge for the prosecution 
will be to demonstrate that Megrahi and Fhimah actually placed that bomb. But 
first, the Scottish prosecutors must show solid evidence for the Malta Connection 
itself - that there was in fact a bomb-laden suitcase aboard Air Malta 180 on 
the morning that Pan Am 103 exploded. If lawyers for the Crown can't prove that 
beyond reasonable doubt, says Scottish legal scholar John Grant, &quot;the Crown 
case is dead in the water.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At the time of the indictment, 
a US State Department fact sheet pointed to a baggage list found at the Frankfurt 
airport in 1989, which appeared to show that at a suitcase unloaded from the Air 
Malta flight was in the baggage system at the time workers were loading baggage 
on Pan Am 103A. The State Department report said the records &quot;show that an 
unaccompanied bag was routed from Air Malta Flight 180 ... to Frankfurt, where 
it was loaded onto the Pan Am 103 feeder flight to London.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But behind the scenes, 
that assertion was disputed by investigators themselves. An internal FBI memo 
from October of 1989 said it's &quot;misleading&quot; to conclude from the Frankfurt 
airport records that any bag, let alone one carrying a bomb, was transferred from 
the Air Malta flight to the Pan Am plane. It said there's &quot;no concrete indication&quot; 
of that. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In fact, Air Malta and 
Maltese law enforcement officials say Air Malta Flight 180 did not carry any unaccompanied 
luggage on the day that Pan Am 103 blew up. Maltese officials insist that all 
55 bags checked onto the Flight 180 that day were claimed by passengers - and 
that Scottish and American investigators found as much in their interviews with 
passengers. The bags &quot;tallied completely,&quot; says Maltese Police Commissioner 
George Grech. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Malta's Minister of Home 
Affairs, Tonio Borg, makes a more sweeping claim. &quot;We have no proof that 
these two Libyan suspects were involved in anything illegal in Malta regarding 
this case, particularly the placing of this bomb on Air Malta Flight ... 180,&quot; 
Borg says. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A German court agreed. 
A German investigating magistrate produced a report saying he could find no evidence 
of a bag switch from the Air Malta plane to Pan Am 103A at Frankfurt on December 
21, 1988. In 1992 the German government suspended prosecution of the Libyan defendants, 
citing a lack of evidence. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Clothing </b></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The key physical evidence 
purportedly linking the two defendants to the bomb is a scrap of clothing found 
in Lockerbie. Forensic scientists determined the clothing fragment was part of 
a pair of men's checked, brown trousers. That garment, they found, was packed 
along with other clothes in the brown Samsonite that held the bomb. A fragment 
of a tag showed the trousers had been purchased at Mary's House, a small shop 
on a narrow street near the seaside in Sliema, Malta. We went to ask the proprietor 
of Mary's House, Tony Gauci, who bought those trousers, but Gauci long ago grew 
tired of reporters asking that question. He threw us out of his shop. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It's not surprising that 
Gauci dreads the prospect of clarifying his past statements. He gave 19 statements 
to Scottish police between September of 1989 and February, 1991. Those statements 
are riddled with ambiguities and contradictions. Legal observers say it's unlikely 
that Gauci will be of any help to the prosecution in the Netherlands. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The indictment says Gauci 
implicated defendant Megrahi as the man who bought the clothing in the fall of 
1988. But according to his police statements, Gauci's identification of the Libyan 
defendant is ambiguous at best. Police showed Gauci a photo of Megrahi in February 
of 1991. The Scottish police transcript quotes Gauci as saying: </font> 
<blockquote> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;He would 
perhaps have to look about 10 years or more older and he would look like the man 
who bought the clothes. . . . I can only say that of all the photographs I have 
been shown, this photograph. . . . is the only one really similar to the man who 
bought the clothing, if he was a bit older . . . other than the one my brother 
showed me.&quot; </font> </blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> That last remark, about 
the photo shown to Gauci by his brother, is an apparent reference to another suspect 
whom Gauci had <i>previously</i> described as resembling the shopper. Eleven months 
before police showed Gauci the photo of Megrahi, Gauci volunteered for police 
that his brother had shown him a newspaper photo of a Palestinian terrorist named 
Mohammed Abu Talb. Talb had been convicted in the 1985 bombing of a Northwest 
Airlines office in Copenhagen. In that earlier statement, according to the police 
transcript, Gauci said: </font> 
<blockquote> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I think 
the photograph in the newspaper may have been the man who bought the clothing. 
He looks like him.&quot; </font> </blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At the time, Talb was in 
fact a leading suspect in the bombing of Pan Am 103. He had alleged ties to the 
terror group first suspected in the Lockerbie bombing, the PFLP-GC. His accomplice 
in the Copenhagen bombing was seen coming and going from a PFLP-GC safehouse in 
Germany, according to West German police documents. Airport records showed that 
Talb visited Malta in the fall of 1988. A raid of his apartment in Uppsala, Sweden 
turned up an appointment book with the date, December 21, circled. At one point, 
Lockerbie investigators had so much evidence against Mohammed Abu Talb they sought 
to extradite him from Sweden. </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Was there compelling 
reason to look at Abu Talb? Absolutely,&quot; says Vincent Cannistraro, who headed 
the CIA's Lockerbie investigation at the time. &quot;And we did do that. Did the 
law enforcement folk on both sides of the ocean have enough compelling evidence 
to go before a judge? I'm told they did, but I don't know the nature of that, 
and I can't speak to it.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Talb refused requests for 
an interview. He's serving a life sentence in Sweden for the Copenhagen bombing. 
Lockerbie investigators cleared him of the Pan Am bombing for reasons US and British 
officials say they can't discuss. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Besides his vague identification 
of Megrahi as the man who bought clothes for the bomb suitcase, Tony Gauci gave 
statements that directly contradict the prosecution's case. The Mary's House proprietor 
told police he remembered the sale of the brown trousers because the man who bought 
them also purchased an odd array of items, seemingly with little regard to their 
size or desirability: a baby's sleeping garment; a tweed jacket that had languished 
on the rack for five years. &quot;It was as if anything I suggested he buy, he 
would take it,&quot; Gauci is quoted as saying in a police statement. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Gauci could not remember 
exactly when he'd made the sale to the strange-behaving Arab, but he told police 
he did recall a couple of facts that could be helpful in pinpointing the date. 
It was raining, Gauci recalled; that's why the customer bought an umbrella. Gauci 
recalled that the Arab had come in just before his shop's 7 p.m. closing time, 
and that he, Tony, was alone in the shop that evening; his brother, Paul, who 
ordinarily worked evenings too, was home watching a soccer game on TV. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> According to police transcripts, 
Gauci's brother, Paul, told investigators that the most likely date of the purchase 
was November 23, 1988, four weeks before the bombing of Pan Am 103. He recalled 
staying home one evening to watch a soccer game between Rome and Dresden; a schedule 
showed those two teams played on the evening of November 23. And Maltese weather 
data confirms Tony Gauci's memory: rain fell that evening. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But the indictment of the 
Libyans says defendant Megrahi bought the clothes at Mary's House not on November 
23 but on December 7,1988. The problem: the Rome and Dresden soccer teams played 
in the early afternoon, not in the evening, on December 7. And Malta did not get 
a trace of rain that evening.</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Eyewitness </b></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When asked about apparent 
weaknesses in the evidence against the Libyans, former investigators have often 
said: wait - there's an eyewitness. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> His name is Abdul Jiacha, 
and he worked at Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta along with his fellow Libyans, 
the defendants, Megrahi and Fhimah. Former investigators say Jiacha saw one or 
both of the defendants with a brown Samsonite suitcase at the Malta airport on 
the morning of the Lockerbie bombing. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Jiacha starts with serious 
credibility problems. He's been given protection and haven in the United States' 
witness-protection program since 1992. British legal experts say courts in the 
United Kingdom look with a skeptical eye on so-called &quot;supergrasses,&quot; 
or informants who stand to gain financially or otherwise in return for their testimony. 
</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But, credibility problems 
aside, the prosecution's star witness has all but fallen flat, according to two 
sources with access to the defense team's depositions. In a pre-trial statement 
to defense lawyers, Jiacha could only say he saw a man, &quot;possibly&quot; the 
defendant Megrahi, carrying a suitcase in the Malta airport &quot;sometime in 
December,&quot; 1988, the sources say. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><b>Malta <i>dis-</i>Connection? 
</b></b></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In total, the publicly-touted 
evidence against the Libyans is profoundly flawed, say several respected legal 
experts in Britain. British law bans public discussion of a pending criminal case. 
But when top British attorney Michael Mansfield could speak freely, back in 1997, 
he summarized the Malta evidence this way for BBC Scotland: </font> 
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So far as the Maltese 
connection is concerned, the clothing, the identification ... all of that, I think 
add up to a situation in which were it to be presented to a court in the United 
Kingdom, it probably wouldn't even get past the doors. It would be declared at 
some point or another inadmissible ... because it is so fatally flawed at the 
very root. </font></blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Pressed to respond to that 
kind of characterization, former Lockerbie investigators retreat to broad assertions 
that the evidence is in fact strong, despite appearances to the contrary. </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What I do know is 
that the investigation finally led to conclude that that bomb was placed on an 
Air Malta flight and fed into Pan Am 103 in Frankfurt,&quot; says former CIA official 
Vincent Cannistraro. </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;You asked my opinion 
and my opinion is that the evidence is overwhelming and compelling, and. . .that 
the Scottish judges will see it that way,&quot; says &quot;Buck&quot; Revell, 
formerly head of the FBI's Lockerbie investigation. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Both officials suggest 
there might be evidence against the Libyans that emerged after they left their 
respective agencies and of which even they are not aware. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> That's theoretically possible, 
legal experts say. But some observers point to signs of desperation - of a prosecution 
team grasping at the barest circumstantial evidence. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In late summer, 1999, Scottish 
police gathered information at a hearing in Malta about a finding of Semtex plastic 
explosive on the island in the mid-1980s. George Grech, now Malta's Police Commissioner, 
was a district supervisor in 1985, when he found a quantity of Semtex buried alongside 
a murder victim near a stone tower in northern Malta. The Semtex was wrapped in 
an Arabic-language newspaper. Grech says Scottish investigators knew about the 
find as early as 1989, when they were first examining the Malta Connection. Lockerbie 
investigators showed little interest in the Semtex at the time, Grech says - and 
appropriately, he adds, since in his view there is no evidence whatever linking 
that found explosive to the Lockerbie bombing or the Libyan defendants. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Nonetheless, with the trial 
approaching, Scottish police went back to Malta last summer and incorporated Grech's 
discovery of Semtex as circumstantial evidence into the pre-trial indictment of 
the Libyans. The new indictment refers to the defendants having high performance 
plastic explosives in their possession between 1 January 1985 and 21 December 
1988 &quot;in an area of ground near Ghallis Tower, Malta,&quot; the area where 
Grech found the explosives in 1985. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The generally self-contained 
Grech gets animated when expressing his puzzlement that prosecutors would try 
to link that Semtex to the destruction of Pan Am 103. </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I myself argued this 
question with them,&quot; Grech says. &quot;Don't tell me somebody had already 
conceived to down an American airplane in 1985 already!&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A senior legal expert in 
Scotland who has followed the Lockerbie case closely is sharply critical of the 
investigation itself. &quot;This case has been handled very badly, and certainly 
not in accordance with expected standards,&quot; said the source, who spoke on 
the condition he not be named because of Britain's ban on public comment of a 
pending criminal case. &quot;It's normal to investigate first and then indict. 
In this case, they have come to a conclusion and then investigated only events 
which fit their conclusion.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><b>The Political Context </b></b></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">British and US officials 
say the Lockerbie investigation has been steered by just one thing: the evidence. 
</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But some relatives of those 
killed on Pan Am 103 and expert observers have speculated that Middle East politics 
played a role in that decision, too. The early suspects, members of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), had close ties 
to Syrian intelligence agencies. &quot;Having the PFLP-GC under the microscope 
also meant having the Syrian government under the microscope,&quot; says former 
CIA counter-terrorism chief Cannistraro. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But while investigating 
the PFLP-GC, the West was actively courting the man who gave that group haven, 
Syrian President Haffez Assad, for his help in the Middle East peace process. 
Then, in August, 1990, a new crisis erupted - the Gulf War - giving the administration 
yet another reason to do business with Damascus. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> After Iraq invaded Kuwait, 
the Bush Administration rallied an international coalition to confront Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein. Syria joined the alliance and sent troops for Operation Desert 
Storm - a step of crucial symbolic importance in building support for the alliance 
among Arab countries, analysts say. Secretary of State James Baker rewarded Assad 
by visiting him in Damascus in the fall of 1990. Critics suggested the visit sent 
the wrong message on terrorism. Baker bristled: &quot;We are not embracing Syria 
and everything that Syria has done with which we disagree.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Nonetheless, when the Bush 
Administration cleared the Syria-based terrorists in the Lockerbie bombing a year 
later, some relatives of Pan Am 103 victims wondered out loud if a deal had been 
done. That suspicion was heightened by the release, four days after the indictments, 
of prominent Western hostages Terry Waite and Thomas Sutherland, who'd been held 
in Beirut by Hizbollah terrorists under the control of the Syrian government. 
</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Jim Swire, whose daughter 
died on Pan Am 103, says it was plainly in the interests of the British and American 
governments to absolve Syria and accuse Libya instead. </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;That doesn't mean 
that Libya or Libyan citizens are guilty or not guilty,&quot; Swire says. &quot;It 
merely undermines my faith as an individual in what governments are telling me 
because it is so extremely convenient for them.&quot; </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Certainly had the 
evidence led to Syria at that time, it would have been extremely inconvenient 
and very, very complicated in the US diplomacy,&quot; says Middle East expert 
Shibley Telhami of the University of Maryland. &quot;So if evidence later came 
that implicated Libya, that certainly would lead to a sense of relief that it 
was not Syria.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Telhami says he assumes 
that the turn in the Lockerbie investigation was made in good faith. Another expert 
thinks otherwise. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Noel Koch, the former counter-terrorism 
chief at the Pentagon, says his opinion about Lockerbie is based on a reading 
of the evidence - he finds the case against the Libyans thoroughly unpersuasive 
- and on his inside observations of the Reagan/Bush Administration's approach 
to state-sponsored terrorism. In the 1980s, Koch sat on an anti-terrorism task 
force headed by then-Vice President Bush. He was constantly frustrated, he says, 
by what he describes as the administration's unwillingness to take firm action 
against <i>all </i>Middle East nations that sponsored terrorism. </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Whenever you got 
to the point where you needed to take some overt action to demonstrate you were 
actually doing something about terrorism, Libya was the preferred target,&quot; 
Koch says, &quot;simply because Colonel Qadhafi himself was viewed in the Islamic 
world as an apostate, in the Arab world as a pariah. Nothing much was lost by 
going after him. A great deal could be lost by going after Syria or Iran or Iraq 
or other countries that had an involvement in terrorism and which were, in fact, 
known by the United States to be involved in terrorism.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Koch says he's convinced 
that, two years after he left the Pentagon, the administration of then-President 
Bush repeated the pattern of scapegoating Libya in the case of Pan Am 103. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Former President Bush and 
his Secretary of State James Baker both declined to be interviewed for this report. 
</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Buck Revell, who oversaw 
the Lockerbie investigation for the FBI until six months before the Libyans were 
indicted, denies suggestions of political influence. &quot;There was never any 
indication from President Reagan or thereafter President Bush - any interjection 
of any geopolitical concerns.&quot; Revell adds that if either president had tried 
to influence the investigation, &quot;We would have had to end up with a special 
prosecutor.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><b> A Provocative, Persistent 
Claim: US Covert Operations on Pan Am 103? </b> </b></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pre-trial hearings have 
made it clear that lawyers for the Libyan defendants are prepared not only to 
assert their clients' innocence, but to suggest an alternate version of events: 
that the Iranian government and the Syria-based terrorists, the PFLP-GC, conspired 
and carried out the bombing. There are also signs that an even more provocative 
claim will get resurrected in the courtroom: that covert US government drug operations 
may have provided the bombers an opening to blow up Pan Am 103. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the early 1990's, Time 
magazine and TV networks on both sides of the Atlantic produced major stories 
exploring that claim. Their most important source: a private investigator who'd 
been hired by Pan Am to investigate who blew up Flight 103 and how they did it. 
The investigator, Juval Aviv, emerged from his investigation with a remarkable 
claim: that members of the PFLP-GC took advantage of a controlled drug-smuggling 
route involving US agents to slip the bomb on the Pan Am jet. Government officials 
vehemently denied the assertion, and still do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to Aviv's report, 
Pan Am filed subpoenas with several US intelligence and law enforcement agencies, 
seeking documents to confirm or refute the private investigator's findings. The 
government refused to release the documents on grounds of national security. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some government officials 
attacked Aviv's credibility, calling him a fabricator who had lied about his background. 
The specifics of that accusation against Aviv don't appear to stand up to scrutiny. 
</font></p>

Appearing on Britain's Channel Four in 1994, former FBI Director of Investigations 
&quot;Buck&quot; Revell was asked if US agents ran operations in cooperation with 
Middle East drug dealers around the time of the Pan Am attack. &quot;There was 
intelligence being gathered,&quot; Revell replied. &quot;DEA [Drug Enforcement 
Administration] assets were tasked by orders from the National Security Council 
to try to develop intelligence information on the American hostages in Lebanon. 
They were not used in conjunction with Pan Am 103. That entire operation had been 
closed down.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But it appears defense lawyers 
at the Lockerbie trial may try to prove otherwise &#150; that some kind of DEA 
operation was in fact underway in late December, 1988.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two men who were high-ranking 
security managers with Pan Am at the time told us they've given statements to 
the defense team claiming that they were told of a US government drug operation 
on their airline, through Frankfurt, at the time Pan Am 103 was destroyed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jim Berwick was the London-based 
Manager of Corporate Security for Pan Am in 1988. He says at a quarterly meeting 
a couple of months before the bombing of Pan Am 103, Phillip Connolly approached 
him during a break. Connolly was one of the highest-ranking investigators in British 
Customs and a 20-year acquaintance of Berwick's. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;And it was at that 
time that [Connolly] gave me the indication that he had been the British Customs 
representative at a meeting in Germany, where there were representatives of German 
Customs and also DEA, and where it became known to Phil that Pan Am in actual 
fact was being used as a conduit or a route on which drug shipments were being 
allowed from Europe to the U-S.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another Pan Am security 
manager at London's Heathrow Airport, Mike Jones, says he too was present when 
Connolly told the story. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jones says Connolly then 
phoned a few days after Pan Am 103 blew up and asked if Jones had considered the 
possibility that 'the bag' had been switched at the Frankfurt airport.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;And I took that to 
mean &#150; it was a gentle hint &#150; that, had we thought about a substitution 
of the controlled drugs bag,&quot; Jones says.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The man whom Jones says 
made that call, Phillip Connolly, is now retired from British Customs. We couldn't 
reach him for comment. A source close to lawyers for the Libyans says Connolly 
has given a deposition and may be called as a witness at the trial. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spokespersons for British 
Customs in London declined to comment on the claims by Berwick and Jones. A US 
Justice Department spokesman said the department would not respond to questions 
about drugs on Pan Am 103.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If there was...even 
a smell of government involvement in [the bombing of] Pan Am 103, I'd be the first 
one up snitching on the government,&quot; says Michael Hurley, who was the DEA's 
top official in Cyprus in 1988. Even if government agents were running a controlled 
drug route from the Middle East through the Frankfurt airport, he says, that would 
not create an opportunity for terrorists. &quot;When you do a controlled delivery, 
you have control of the drugs from the point of origin to the destination,&quot; 
Hurley says.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Support for the drug claims, 
however, comes from one more surprising direction. A senior source responsible 
for overseeing the Lockerbie investigation for the German government told us that 
if we wanted to get closer to the truth about Lockerbie, we should &quot;go back 
and look at the drugs.&quot; The source spoke on the condition that he not be 
named. The remark is striking given that the German government, according to the 
claims by Aviv and others, cooperated with US and British agents in the controlled 
drug operation through Frankfurt. So the Germans would share in any embarrassment 
if it were discovered that such an operation helped to facilitate the bombing 
of Pan Am 103. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion: Elusive Justice?</b></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's quite difficult 
to come back and picture what it was like,&quot; says Bill Parr, his gentle voice 
barely audible above the soft rumble of his Land Rover. &quot;You allow your mind 
to ... shade out the horrors.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Parr is a long-time resident 
of Lockerbie, a horse-lover and chemist for the local government. He's also a 
volunteer search-and-rescue worker. So he and his dog spent the night of December 
21, 1988, finding and marking dozens of the 259 bodies that fell from the sky. 
On a driving tour of the places he went that night, he looks out the window at 
the rolling green of a municipal golf course on the edge of Lockerbie. His voice 
falters and his eyes fill up. &quot;I hadn't realized. I thought I'd managed to 
put a lot of it behind. But it's all these hills at the back here. This is where 
the large number of bodies were found.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Parr says he's haunted 
by images of those bodies - some gruesome, some poignant. He recalls finding the 
bodies of two young women sitting in a field, completely intact, still strapped 
to their seats. Their arms were wrapped tightly around one another, their fingers 
crossed. It's one of the hardest things to face, Parr says: the implication that 
those two young women were conscious during their long fall to earth. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Parr says that night planted 
a seed of anger that flourishes inside him to this day. &quot;There were a lot 
of us, and I wasn't alone, but I'll stand there and I'll say it: If somebody had 
said, 'Here's a gun, these are definitely the people who did it,' I would have 
pulled the trigger, even though I know it [would be] wrong,&quot; Parr says. &quot;Looking 
back now, I think that would have been too good for them.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Parr admits his anger, 
though deep and lasting, is only that of an unlucky volunteer forced to confront 
the mayhem. The young women whose bodies he found were strangers to him. They 
were someone else's daughters. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Jane and Jim Swire, whose 
daughter Flora died over Lockerbie, say they yearn to see someone punished - but 
it must be the right people. </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Whatever [the Libyan 
defendants] are accused of, however horrendous their deeds are alleged to have 
been, they are entitled to a presumption of innocence, unless and until they're 
found guilty,&quot; Jim Swire says. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Swires spend their 
summers on Scotland's Isle of Skye, a couple of hundred miles from Lockerbie. 
The family's vacation home overlooks windswept coastland dotted with sheep, highland 
cattle, and crofts - small stone houses painted white. Flora Swire loved Skye, 
says her mother, Jane. &quot;Whenever I see the sea sparkling and the mountains 
purple and the sky shot with tangerine and blue, I think, Flora should be seeing 
this. She should be here to enjoy this, with <i>her</i> family. And I know she 
never can. And that just highlights the cruelty and the sadness.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If Abdelbaset Megrahi and 
Al-Amin Fhimah killed Flora and 269 other people, the Swires say, they hope that 
will become clear at the trial. But Jim Swire says his grief is made worse by 
a suspicion that the main culprits behind the bombing got away. </font> 
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Overwhelmingly, the 
one thing that matters and keeps coming to the surface is our loss and more importantly 
Flora's loss. She lost the rest of her life, we've lost her lovely company for 
the rest of our lives. But, yes, the failure to get to the root of it has kept 
my anger burning.&quot; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Lockerbie bombing has 
been called the world's biggest unsolved murder. Some who lost loved ones on Pan 
Am 103 say they're afraid that won't change - no matter what the verdict in the 
Netherlands. </font>
