For many years he travelled the world encountering statesmen, relatives of victims from PA 103 and diplomats. Now he is dead; yesterday Maltese diplomat Dr. John Buontempo passed away while attending the Lockerbie-bombing trial in the Netherlands. He was 69.  A former ambassador to countries like Syria and Jordan, Dr. Buontempo had the view that his deep personal knowledge of the world�s decicion-makers might forward a solution to the ongoing political crisis between Libya and the West. On a personal initiative he started his very own peace-initiative, urging the involved parts to settle the Lockerbie-crisis on peaceful and legal grounds. He was still working on that cause, when he was suddenly taken away yesterday in the Netherlands while attending trial with his wife. Dr. Buontempo was a physician by profession. His body will be brought to Malta for burial.  Dr. Buontempo and his strong sense of initiative will be missed.  His website "WHY THE LOCKERBIE CASE PROCRASTINATED SO LONG? " with the humorous subtitle "THE BUONTEMPO'S INTERNATIONAL ENDOSCOPIC DIPLOMATIC MEDIATION" is still active. Since the breaking news of Dr. Buontempo�s death, numerous visitors have honored Malta�s great diplomat by writing in his still active guestbook section.

I am an explosives engineer of 36 years standing and I assisted at Lockerbie on the night of the disater and over the christmas break. I was the first explosives qualified person to categorically state to the head Patholojist that a young girls body had been impacted with explosivekly driven fragments. She was 9 or 10 years old and had been seated in the STARBOARD side of the aircraft! I walked away 11 years ago but like naive explorer I have returned to that time and place and found ther truth. For the protection of my family I have forwarded my report to many. It is unwelcome!! For Mr Cohens information I am not a nutcase but unlike so many of the pundits and would be experts I was there - apart from that while serving in the British military I personally destroyed 2 large aircraft with controlled explosives so I know the effects of explosives against aircraft structures. I have also sent my report to the trial judges and the crown prosecution service includuing Jim Swires. The British PM is aware alonf with several other prominant UK Politicians. If I am to be accused of telling lies then I challlenge the court to charge me with contempt of court. It appears that as long as there is someone in the dock for this crime that will do and it matters not what the truth is. I seek no reward for my information other than seeing the truth being told and to protect my family. John Parkes Explosives Engineer.

The significance of explosively driven fragments which I personally witnessed in the body of a victim is that the presence of fragments in any of the victims bodies is denied within the AAIB report. The AAIB report wrongly uses the word SHRAPNEL. To deny that any "Shrapnel" was found in any of the victims bodies is to deny that a more serious chain of explosive activity took place in the aircrafts hold leading to its loss!  Furthermore the "reputed" IED (Improvised Explosive Device) would not have been powerfull enough to send fragments into the passenger compartment - this is a physical imposibility and an utter nonsense. Everyone should be aware that this aircraft had a retrofitted stronger than normal floor as it was a CRAF machine. Namely it had been converetd for emergency military use hence CIVIL AIRCRAFT RESERVE FLEET!! Furthermore the victim I identified as having been struck with an explosively projected fragment cloud was sitting on the wrong side of the aircraft. The "reputed" container in which the "reputed" IED was located (number AVE 4041 PA) was on the port side of the aircraft - the little girl I witnessed had been sitting in the Starboard side of the aircraft!  Please study the AAIB report closely - it is so seriouisly flawed it is an insult to anyones inteligence. Seek and ye shall find. Thank you for your interest.  Yours sincerely. JOHN PARKES   JOHN PARKES       To Mr Cohen  Saturday, 22-Jul-2000 11:41:06   Message:  195.92.194.13 writes:  Dear Mr Cohen - I apolojise that you took my statement the wrong way. It was not intended to offend. No one more than myself appreciates that you and all of the relatives will have been inundated with claims from hundreds of ill informed and or corrupt people over the years - I have shared in your sadness but I now feel guilty that I walked away from the issue and put it behind me all those years ago but you must remember that I was a volunteer with no official standing. Had I had an official standing I would have been gagged like so many others so perhaps it is just as well. I did never the less submit a lenthy report to the Scottish Office (I have proof of receipt of this) As to comming forward with my evidence I have been doing just that for the LAST FIVE WEEKS but my report is being passed from pillar to post like an unwanted parcel. The Lord Advocate, the trial Judges and the defence Lawyers have all received copies of my report and I have confirmation of receipt from the Crowns side! NOTHING from any of the defence teams I may add which makes me wonder. Perhaps a knock out blow is not desired for one reason or another! Furthermore most of my E mails to US sites have not been received, been redirected or simply ignored. I also made Ian Ferguson the journalist aware many weeks ago and a subsequent reporter from the Scottish Sunday Herald flew from my house like a scalded cat when I showed him proof of my findings - I have also sent my report to several British Broadsheets and have not even recieved the courtesy of a reply! Furthermore some UK politicians have replied in the posiitve and some have not replied as yet. Indeed I am still wating to hear from our Foreign Office after sending in my report almost 3 weeks ago at the behest of our PRIME MINISTER. No one to date has openly dismissed my findings or called me a liar or a fabricator. I would be happy to provide you with a copy of my report if I could E mail it or fax it to you. Should you or any of your friends wish to view my credentials I am more than willing to show them such. There is only just so much one man can do. I have sacrificed much more than just my name in the cause of truth but I can live with that in the knowledge that i did not brake the law in the first place and it is not I that has interfered with - or indeed is still interfering with the scales of justice. Again I apolojise for offending you by my choice of words. If you send me a private E mail and I can authenticate who you are I will gladly give you my telephone number and my address. I would however mention that many irregular things are happening on my telephone line! Unlike so many others who are involved in this thing I have nothing to hide. Yours sincerely,  John Parkes.   John Parkes    Re: Taking the technical discussion further  Tuesday, 01-Aug-2000 19:53:37   195.92.194.78 writes:  Dear Timothy -  Thank you for getting things back into a sandless arena. I would have preferred that you had homed in on a less distressing part of my report. We must never forget that this young girl was a human being who certainly did not deserve what became of her. Just like every other human being on that ill fated flight. However, for her sake and the sake of all the other lost souls I will answer your question but only briefly. I hope the NOK will understand and forgive me.  1/ Fragmentation wounds. There is nothing else that could possibly replicate the effects of explosively driven fragments on the human body other than explosively driven fragments - trust me I have seen it before. Trauma injuries just do not produce the same effects.  2/ Unwounded areas. Where I mention blast shadow this simply means that the fragment cloud or blast effects were interupted and stopped by something lying in the path of the same. In other words a receptor of some kind. Just imagine someone blasting away at you with a shotgun and you took cover behind a heavy plank fence with a 2 inch gap betweem the planks. Obvioulsy the pellets could still hit you through the a 2 inch gap so the "unwounded" part of your body would be considered as having been in the blast shadow of the fence boards.  3/ The strike pattern of the fragments was consistant with the fragment cloud having arrived at an oblique angle from behind and below the victim. If one finds the 9 year old girls seat number one will see that it is forward of the main event that took place on the starboard side. The drawing of the foor plan of the recovered wreckage shows this area very well. Indeed it clearly shows that considerably more damage was occasioned to the floor in that STARBOARD location than that depicted to the PORT location of the "supposed" container in which the "supposed IED" was located.  4/ Holing of the victims stocking soles; Although the vicims calves displayed characteristic fragment wounding the skin on the soles of the childs feet was unbroken. Whatever caused the multiple and uniform small holing of the stocking soles had to have been stopped at that point.  As fragmentation clouds contain various sizes and velocities of fragments a fragmentation strike has to be ruled out. A rocket motors E flux (exhaust)must have been the responsible element. As a point if interest when one fired early types of Rocket Propelled Munitions one would often feel small and very hot particles of E flux stinging your face. Due to the improvements made to rocket propllelants over the years those firing Modern Shoulder launched Rocket propelled munitions seem not to suffer from this.  I really do not want to publically advance this particular issue any further at this time.  Yours sincerely John Parkes    Court Transcripts for Sale at Camp Zeist  The Crown Office is ready to release daily court transcripts to the public at a charge of 100 Dutch gulden (30 UK pounds/50 USD). However it might take a period of two days for transcripts to become available. The release of court transcripts could clear the problem of media news reports being contradictionary or inaccurate. Yesterday BBC had to remove and change a news report saying MEBO boss Bollier recognized timer fragments as being from his firm, while Reuters and AP broke news that Bollier did not acknowledge 100 % that the fragments came from his timers. Today BBC might re-change that story once more.  For getting a copy of the court transcripts, contact the Scottish Courts media Center at Camp Zeist:  Mail: Postbus 1990, NL-3700 BZ Zeist - The Nederlands  Phone: (+31) 346 334787or 346 334788  Fax: (+31) 346 334795    Allegations Against Lockerbie Trial Briefing Unit  The  Lockerbie Trial Briefing Unit posted the following statement today on the front page of its website:  Headline - May 21, 2000    Allegations against the Lockerbie Unit   Three Sunday newspapers carry stories about the Lockerbie Trial Briefing Unit, alleging that Professor Andrew Fulton, the coordinator of the Unit, was a member of MI6. The Sunday Herald says that the allegations "will seriously undermine claims by the Lockerbie trial briefing unit that it has been been giving independent and impartial advice." The Sunday Times Scotland and Scotland on Sunday report that Fulton will be dismissed from the LTB Unit.  It has not been the practice of the LTB Unit to comment on press speculation. Members of the Unit have been asked on many occasions to comment on the quality of the evidence against Megrahi and Fhimah and have resolutely refused to do so. Professor John Grant, the Director of the Unit, said this morning, "I am disappointed that we have become the story when a major criminal trial is trying to determine who is responsible for the deaths of 270 people. The Unit has consistently offered impartial advice and assistance to those with an interest in the trial. The news organisations throughout the world who have spoken to members of our team can bear testimony to our impartiality. I have no personal knowledge of any connection between Andrew Fulton and the British intelligence service.  I cannot contact Andrew at the moment, but I shall be speaking to him during the week from Camp Zeist, where I am covering the restart of the trial on Tuesday. Our independence and impartiality are articles of faith with us. Any prejudice to that independence and impartiality is, of course, of great concern to us."  Author: Prof. John P. Grant   JNS Editor's Comment:-  Here are links to the Scottish Newspapers allegations:  Sunday Herald    "Lockerbie press aide was top MI6 agent"   Sunday Times    "Lockerbie law expert 'member of MI6'"   Scotland On Sunday    "Lockerbie briefing team chief revealed as former MI6 man"    ^^^^ TOP ^^^^   Tehran IRNA in English 0856 GMT 7 Jun 00  [FBIS Transcribed Text] Vienna, June 7, IRNA -- an informed source here Tuesday quoted Austrian police as dismissing claims made by an Iranian defector identified as Ahmad Behbahani on his involvement in the murder of secretary of the dissolved Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) of Iran, Abdurrahman Qssemlou as "mere lies".  The source, talking to IRNA on condition of anonymity, said Ahmad Behbahani together with his wife and nine-year-old son sought asylum in Austria in 1990. He then claimed membership in the terrorist Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO), the source said, adding that assemlou was murdered in Vienna in 1989.  The source who has close contacts with Austrian security officials said that the Austrian police was investigating Behbahani's claims and had examined his fingerprints with those suspected of involvement in Qassemlou's murder.  The result of the investigations show that Behbahani had played no role in the murder case, the source said.  He quoted an inspector as wondering that how would it be possible for a person to commit a crime in Austria in 1989 and seek asylum in the country in 1990?  The source further added that after a few months, Austrian officials turned down Behbahani's demand for asylum because they found out the futility of his claims on being under prosecution.  Behbahani had arrived in Vienna on board of an Iran Air flight and presented no convincing evidence proving that he was under prosecution in Iran, said the source.  He said that according to the documents available with the Austrian police, Behbahani, his wife and son then left for New Zealand after facing Austria's negative response.  The source said that according to the file available at the Austrian police department, Behbahani was born in 1955 and his wife in 1952, adding that his fingerprints as well as his demand for asylum are registered in the file.  Behbahani in a recent interview with the U.S. television network CBS claimed that he was a member of the Iranian Information Ministry and had murdered Qassemlou in Vienna in 1989 upon an order from the Iranian officials.  In another development, Houshang Amir-Ahmadi, an Iranian residing in the U.S., told the Voice of America (VOA) Tuesday that the CBS broadcast on Behbahani was "a hasty and emotional program."  Amir-Ahmadi, speaking to the VOA as a lecturer in America, further added that the broadcast was in contradiction with previous CBS programs which were usually analytic and precise.  He said he had talked to several friends of Behbahani and had concluded that no one knows him in Tehran and that he had definitely not been a senior Information Ministry official. Even his ordinary status cannot be approved or denied, Amir-Ahmadi said.  He said the fact that the Information Ministry has quickly denied the case is another proof that he had not served at the ministry as a senior official. Because, he added, the identity of lower rank personnel can be easily denied whereas denial of senior officials' identity is a difficult task.  Moreover, Amir-Ahmadi noted, the said person was between 19 to 20 years of age when the Lockerbie bombing took place and a key organization such as the Information Ministry would neither leave the planning nor implementation of such an important task to a young man.  He said apparently the U.S. administration has very quickly decided upon the case, adding that it was the first time he noticed the administration showed no enthusiasm in following the issue and the U.S. State Department announced that the report will not change its Iran policy.  In Amir-Ahmadi's point of view, agents from the MKO, Israel and Turkey as well as those who might be in Arab counties may have a hand in the case.  However, he said that not only the U.S. would not benefit from the case but on the contrary lose because it is not willing to revive the Lockerbie incident after 12 years as the West has tried for long years to attribute it to Libya. Otherwise, he added, there would emerge an international problem as they have imposed sanctions on Libya and inflicted billions of dollars damage on the country.   Comment:      "Expert" has become a dirty word. According to the Oxford Dictionary, which calls itself "authoritative" but we can consult it as it does not claim to be "expert": "Expert - Having special knowledge or skill." Interesting. I always thought expert came from experience. Perhaps originally it did. But as the English became masters of twisting their own language, unlike the French who have a special committee to keep it stable, we should not be surprised. Nevertheless, even if "Expert" meant "God" or "Money" we would be well advised to stay clear, ignore, even isolate or incarcerate anyone labelled an "expert" by themselves, the governments or the media. This was our first thought when we heard yet another British Expert say that this man is responsible for the "Lockerbie bomb". And we were not wrong. Even  Meddeling Halfbright said "we should listen to this Iranian". Many many such experts and convenient tourists-cum-terrorists will surface over the coming weeks and months as the British-American-"Israeli" so-called Intelligence Services seek to avoid being crushed by the collapse of their Mu'ammara Building. We would also do well to snub those who label themselves "Intelligent"!   ^^^^ TOP ^^^^       Join GCi - Build Freedom and Democracy!        Join our monthly mailing list              Join our daily discussion list                        Quick Menu Main Index Mathaba Authors Info Partners About Mathaba Publish Articles RSS News Feeds Help Info Stay informed!
