The United States and Scotland issued indictments against two Libyan intelligence officers for the bombing, but Libya refused to surrender the suspects, leading the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions against the country in 1992. After years of negotiations and sanctions, Libya agreed to extradite the two suspects, on condition that they be tried in a third country. So a Scottish court convened in the Netherlands, and the suspects were extradited more than 10 years after the Boeing 747 was bombed. In 2009, despite strenuous American opposition, the Scottish government ordered the release of the bombing planner,  Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi , on compassionate grounds and permitted him to return home after serving 8 years of his 27-year minimum sentence for murdering 270 people. He qualified for compassionate release after medical evidence showed he would die within months of prostate cancer. The hero’s welcome back in Libya for Mr. Megrahi, and his failure to die infuriated the United States and other Western governments, and calls for his return mounted as the Libyan revolution unfolded in 2011. With the fall of the Qadaffi regime at hand, CNN reported that Mr. Megrahi  was near death at his villa in the capital in August 2011, broadcasting images of a frail man lying comatose in an oxygen mask. Mr. Megrahi’s death would end the possibility of eliciting his full account of the Libyan government’s role in the bombing. But it would also remove a potentially serious point of friction between the rebels’ Transitional National Council and its Western backers. Politicians and lawmakers in the United States had begun calling for his return to finish answering for the bombing. But the justice minister of the transitional council equated an extradition of Mr. Megrahi with a betrayal characteristic of the hated and fugitive dictator, Muammar el-Qaddafi. Read More...  Background  Sixteen months after Mr. Megrahi's conviction, Col. Qadaffi's regime in Libya acknowledged responsibility and offered $10 million in damages for each of the 270 victims, although that payment later became an issue. Libya offered the money in stages, as sanctions were removed, and the last portion was to come after the United States restored full diplomatic relations. In May 2006 the United States agreed to do so, but that was after the deadline set by Libya in the agreement, so the final $2 million per family was not paid. Congress considered legislation that would bar construction of a new American embassy in Tripoli until Libya settles with the families, and with the victims of a previous terror attack, the bombing in 1986 of a disco popular with American servicemen in what was then West Berlin. Lawyers for those victims say their Libyan counterparts had agreed to damage payments but then reneged. After the West Berlin bombings, President Ronald Reagan sent warplanes to bomb Tripoli. But relations between Libya and both the United States and Britain warmed after the country disclosed it had a nuclear weapons program and agreed to give it up. American officials described their treatment of Libya as an inducement to other countries to give up nuclear weapons programs. In 2007, a Scottish legal panel concluded that Mr. Megrahi should be granted an appeal, challenging some of the evidence presented at his trial. In 2009, more than 20 years after� the jumbo jet was bombed, a five-member panel of judges in Edinburgh began hearing the case. In August 2009, before he was released, his lawyers abandoned the appeal. Mr. Megrahi has always professed his innocence, a stand he affirmed in a written statement read at a court hearing in November 2008 that failed to win him release because of his prostate cancer.
