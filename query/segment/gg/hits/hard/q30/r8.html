      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><i>&quot;Victor Marchetti, former 
      executive assistant to the CIA's deputy director and co-author of 'The CIA 
      and the Cult of Intelligence,' believes that the presence of the [five-man 
      intelligence] team on Flight 103 is a clue that should not be ignored. His 
      contacts at Langley agree. 'It's like the loose thread of a sweater,'' he 
      says. ''Pull on it, and the whole thing may unravel.'&quot;</i></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Washington says 
      Libya sabotaged the plane. Provocative evidence suggests that a Syrian 
      drug dealer may have helped plant the bomb -- and the real targets were 
      intelligence agents working for the CIA</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">''FOR THREE YEARS, 
      I've had a feeling that if Chuck hadn't been on that plane, it wouldn't 
      have been bombed,'' says Beulah McKee, 75. Her bitterness has still not 
      subsided. But seated in the parlor of her house in Trafford, Pennsylvania, 
      the house where her son was born 43 years ago, she struggles to speak 
      serenely. ''I know that's not what our President wants me to say,'' she 
      admits. <br>
      <br>
      George Bush's letter of condolence, written almost four months after the 
      shattered remains of Pan Am Flight 103 fell on Lockerbie, Scotland, on 
      Dec. 21, 1988, expressed the usual ''my heart goes out to you'' sorrow. 
      ''No action by this government can restore the loss you have suffered,'' 
      he concluded. But deep inside, Mrs. McKee suspects it was a government 
      action gone horribly awry that indirectly led to her only son's death. 
      ''I've never been satisfied at all by what the people in Washington told 
      me,'' she says. <br>
      <br>
      Today, as the U.S. spearheads the U.N.-sanctioned embargo against Libya 
      for not handing over two suspects in the bombing, Mrs. McKee wonders if 
      Chuck's background contains the secret of why this plane was targeted. If 
      her suspicions are correct, Washington may not be telling the entire 
      story. Major Charles Dennis McKee, called ''Tiny'' by his Army 
      intelligence friends, was a burly giant and a superstar in just about 
      every kind of commando training offered to American military personnel. He 
      completed the rugged Airborne and Ranger schools, graduated first in his 
      class from the Special Forces qualification course, and served with the 
      Green Berets. In Beirut he was identified merely as a military attache 
      assigned to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). But his hulking 
      physique didn't fit such a low- profile diplomatic post. Friends there 
      remember him as a ''walking arsenal'' of guns and knives. His real 
      assignment reportedly was to work with the CIA in reconnoitering the 
      American hostages in Lebanon and then, if feasible, to lead a daring raid 
      that would rescue them. <br>
      <br>
      McKee's thick, 37-page Army dossier contains so many blacked-out words 
      that it's hard to glean the danger he faced. Surviving the censor's ink 
      was his title, ''Team Chief.'' Under ''Evaluation,'' it was written that 
      he ''performs constantly in the highest-stress environment with clear 
      operational judgment and demeanor . . . Especially strong in accomplishing 
      the mission with minimal guidance and supervision . . . Continues to 
      perform one of the most hazardous and demanding jobs in the Army.'' <br>
      <br>
      For Beulah McKee the mystery deepened six months after Chuck's death, when 
      she received a letter from another U.S. agent in Beirut. It was signed 
      ''John Carpenter,'' a name the Pentagon says it can't further identify. 
      Although the letter claimed that Chuck's presence on the Pan Am plane was 
      unrelated to the bombing, Carpenter's message only stirred her suspicions. 
      ''I cannot comment on Chuck's work,'' he wrote, ''because his work lives 
      on. God willing, in time his labors will bear fruit and you will learn the 
      true story of his heroism and courage.'' <br>
      <br>
      Chuck had given no clues about his work. Back home in November for 
      Thanksgiving three weeks before he perished, he wouldn't even see his 
      friends. ''I don't want to mingle, so I don't have to answer any 
      questions,'' he told his mother. ''Anyway, he didn't have time,'' she 
      recalls. ''He stayed up till 3 every morning studying reports. And when he 
      flew back to Beirut, all he said was, 'Don't worry, Mom. Soon I'll be out 
      from under all this pressure.''' <br>
      <br>
      Almost immediately after the Pan Am bombing, which killed the 259 people 
      aboard the plane and 11 more on the ground, the prime suspect was Ahmed 
      Jibril, the roly-poly boss of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
      Palestine-General Command (P.F.L.P.-G.C.). Two months earlier, West German 
      police had arrested 16 members of his terrorist organization. Seized 
      during the raids was a plastic bomb concealed in a Toshiba cassette 
      player, similar to the one that blew up Flight 103. There was other 
      evidence pointing to Jibril. His patron was Syria. His banker for the 
      attack on the Pan Am plane appeared to be Iran. U.S. intelligence agents 
      even traced a wire transfer of several million dollars to a bank account 
      in Vienna belonging to the P.F.L.P.-G.C. Iran's motive seemed obvious 
      enough. The previous July, the U.S.S. Vincennes had mistakenly shot down 
      an Iranian Airbus over the Persian Gulf, killing all 298 aboard. <br>
      <br>
      Suddenly, last November, the U.S. Justice Department blamed the bombing on 
      two Libyans, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah. The 
      scenario prompted President Bush to remark, ''The Syrians took a bum rap 
      on this.'' It also triggered an outcry from the victims' families, who 
      claimed that pointing the finger at Libya was a political ploy designed to 
      reward Syria for siding with the U.S. in the gulf war and to help win the 
      release of the hostages. <b>Even Vincent Cannistraro, former head of the 
      CIA's investigation of the bombing, told the New York Times it was 
      ''outrageous'' to pin the whole thing on Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
      </b><br>
      <br>
      A four-month investigation by Time has disclosed evidence that raises new 
      questions about the case. Among the discoveries: <br>
      <br>
      -- According to an FBI field report from Germany, the suitcase originating 
      in Malta that supposedly contained the bomb may not have been transferred 
      to Pan Am Flight 103 in Frankfurt, as charged in the indictment of the two 
      Libyans. Instead, the bomb-laden bag may have been substituted in 
      Frankfurt for an innocent piece of luggage. <br>
      <br>
      -- The rogue bag may have been placed on board the plane by Jibril's group 
      with the help of Monzer al-Kassar, a Syrian drug dealer who was 
      cooperating with the U.S.'s Drug Enforcement Administration in a drug 
      sting operation. Al- Kassar thus may have been playing both sides of the 
      fence. <br>
      <br>
      <b>-- Jibril and his group may have targeted that flight because on board 
      was an intelligence team led by Charles McKee, whose job was to find and 
      rescue the hostages. </b><br>
      <br>
      Investigators initially focused their efforts on examining the procedures 
      in the baggage-loading area at Frankfurt's international airport. But 
      risking the transfer of an unaccompanied, bomb-laden suitcase to a 
      connecting flight did not jibe with the precautions terrorists usually 
      take. Security officers using video cameras routinely keep watch over the 
      area. An intricate network of computerized conveyors, the most 
      sophisticated baggage-transfer system in the world, shunts some 60,000 
      suitcases a day between loading bays. Every piece of luggage is logged 
      minute by minute from one position to the next, so its journey through the 
      airport is carefully monitored. The bags are then X-rayed by the airline 
      before being put aboard a plane. <br>
      <br>
      But the U.S. government's charges against al-Megrahi and Fhimah don't 
      explain how the bronze-colored Samsonite suitcase, dispatched via Air 
      Malta, eluded Frankfurt's elaborate airport security system. Instead, the 
      indictment zeroes in on two tiny pieces of forensic evidence -- a 
      fingernail-size fragment of green plastic from a Swiss digital timer, and 
      a charred piece of shirt. <br>
      <br>
      Even though investigators previously thought the bomb was probably 
      detonated by a barometric trigger (considered much more reliable, 
      especially in winter, when flights are frequently delayed and connections 
      missed), a Swiss timer was traced to Libya. The shirt, which presumably 
      had been wrapped around the bomb inside the suitcase, was traced to a 
      boutique in Malta called Mary's House. The owner identified al-Megrahi as 
      the shirt's purchaser, although he originally confused al-Megrahi with a 
      Palestinian terrorist arrested in Sweden. <br>
      <br>
      It was the computer printout produced by FAG, the German company that 
      operates the sophisticated luggage-transfer system, that finally nailed 
      down the indictment of the two Libyans. The printout, discovered months 
      after the bombing, purportedly proved that their suitcase sent from Malta 
      was logged in at Coding Station 206 shortly after 1 p.m. and then routed 
      to Gate 44 in Terminal B, where it was put aboard the Pan Am jet. But a 
      ''priority'' teletype sent from the U.S. embassy in Bonn to the FBI 
      director in Washington on Oct. 23, 1989, reveals that despite the detailed 
      computer records, considerable uncertainty surrounded the movement of this 
      suitcase. <br>
      <br>
      TIME has obtained a copy of the five-page FBI message, which states, 
      ''This computer entry does not indicate the origin of the bag which was 
      sent for loading on board Pan Am 103. Nor does it indicate that the bag 
      was actually loaded on Pan Am 103. It indicates only that a bag of unknown 
      origin was sent from Coding Station 206 at 1:07 p.m. to a position from 
      which it was supposed to be loaded on Pan Am 103.'' <br>
      <br>
      The FBI message further explains that a handwritten record kept by a 
      baggage handler at Coding Station 206 was even less specific about what 
      happened to the suitcase. ''It is noted,'' the teletype continues, ''that 
      the handwritten duty sheet indicates only that the luggage was unloaded 
      from Air Malta 180. There is no indication how much baggage was unloaded 
      or where the luggage was sent.'' The FBI agent's report concludes, '<b>'There 
      remains the possibility that no luggage was transferred from Air Malta 180 
      to Pan Am 103.</b>'' <br>
      <br>
      Also described in the teletype is an incident that ''may provide insight 
      into the possibilities of a rogue bag being inserted into the baggage 
      system.'' On a guided tour of the baggage area in September 1989, it was 
      disclosed, detective inspector Watson McAteer of the Scottish police and 
      FBI special agent Lawrence G. Whitaker ''observed an individual approach 
      Coding Station 206 with a single piece of luggage, place the luggage in a 
      luggage container, encode a destination into the computer and leave 
      without making any notation on a duty sheet.'' This convinced the two 
      investigators that a rogue suitcase could have been ''sent to Pan Am 103 
      either before or after the unloading of Air Malta 180.'' <br>
      <br>
      Lee Kreindler, the lead attorney for the victims' families, who are suing 
      Pan Am for $7 billion, says he can prove that the suitcase from Malta was 
      put aboard Flight 103. He charges that a gross security failure by Pan Am, 
      which went bankrupt in January 1991 and later folded, contributed to the 
      disaster. <br>
      <br>
      But it was the rogue-bag theory that was pursued by Pan Am's law firm, 
      Windels, Marx, Davies &amp; Ives, representing the airline's insurers. To 
      piece together their version of how the bomb was planted, Pan Am's lawyers 
      hired Interfor, Inc., a New York City firm specializing in international 
      intelligence and security. If it hadn't been for the government's 
      implausible plottings revealed during the Iran-contra hearings, Interfor's 
      findings might be dismissed as a private eye's imagination run amuck -- 
      especially considering the controversial background of the company's 
      president, Juval Aviv. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Now 45 and an American citizen, Aviv claims to have headed the Mossad 
      hit squad that hunted down and killed the Arab terrorists who murdered 11 
      Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Israeli and U.S. 
      intelligence sources deny that Aviv was ever associated with Mossad. 
      However, working for Pan Am, he spent more than six months tracking the 
      terrorists who the airline now alleges are responsible for the bombing. 
      While his report has been written off as fiction by many intelligence 
      officials, a number of its findings appear well documented. </b><br>
      <br>
      The central figure emerging from the Interfor investigation is a 
      44-year-old Syrian arms and drug trafficker, Monzer al-Kassar. His 
      brother-in-law is Syria's intelligence chief, Ali Issa Duba, and his wife 
      Raghda is related to Syrian President Hafez Assad. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Al-Kassar has many passports and identities. Most important, he was 
      part of the covert network run by U.S. Lieut. Colonel Oliver North. During 
      the Iran- contra hearings, it was revealed that al-Kassar was given $1.5 
      million to purchase weapons. Questioned about al-Kassar, former U.S. 
      National Security Adviser John Poindexter said, ''When you're buying arms, 
      you often have to deal with people you might not want to go to dinner 
      with.'' </b><br>
      <b><br>
      It was through al-Kassar's efforts, or so he claimed, that two French 
      hostages were released from Lebanon in 1986 in exchange for an arms 
      shipment to Iran. The deal caught the eye of a freewheeling CIA unit 
      code-named COREA, based in Wiesbaden, Germany. This special unit was 
      reported to be trafficking in drugs and arms in order to gain access to 
      terrorist groups. </b><br>
      <br>
      <b>For its cover overseas, COREA used various front companies: Stevens 
      Mantra Corp., AMA Industries, Wildwood Video and Condor Television Ltd. 
      Condor paid its bills with checks drawn on the First American Bank 
      (account No. 2843900) in Washington, D.C., which was subsequently 
      discovered to be a subsidiary of the Bank of Credit and Commerce 
      International. <br>
      </b><br>
      <b>According to Aviv, agents in COREA's Wiesbaden headquarters allowed al-Kassar 
      to continue running his smuggling routes to American cities in exchange 
      for help in obtaining the release of the American hostages being held in 
      Lebanon. At about the same time, al-Kassar's drug-smuggling enterprise was 
      being used by the U.S.'s DEA in a sting operation. The DEA was monitoring 
      heroin shipments from Lebanon to Detroit, Los Angeles and Houston, which 
      have large Arab populations, in an attempt to nail the U.S. dealers.</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      By the fall of 1988, al-Kassar's operation had been spotted by 
      P.F.L.P.-G.C. leader Ahmed Jibril, who had just taken on the assignment 
      from Tehran to avenge the U.S. downing of its Airbus. A CIA undercover 
      agent in Tripoli reported that Jibril also obtained Gaddafi's support. 
      According to Mossad, Jibril dined with al-Kassar at a Paris restaurant and 
      secured a reluctant promise of assistance in planting a bomb aboard an as 
      yet unselected American transatlantic jet. <br>
      <br>
      Al-Kassar's hesitancy was understandable. He wouldn't want anything to 
      disrupt his profitable CIA-assisted drug and arms business. Presumably he 
      was also worried because West German police had just raided the Popular 
      Front hideouts around Dusseldorf and Frankfurt. Among those arrested: the 
      Jordanian technical wizard and bombmaker Marwan Khreesat. <br>
      <br>
      The bomb that ended up on the Pan Am jet could have been assembled by 
      Khreesat. However, last month the Palestine Liberation Organization 
      reported that it was built by Khaisar Haddad (a.k.a. Abu Elias), who is 
      also a member of Jibril's Popular Front. Haddad purchased the detonator, 
      the P.L.O. said, on the Beirut black market for more than $60,000. <br>
      <br>
      The detonator, in fact, is considered one of the main keys to the bombing 
      puzzle. Thomas Hayes, a leading forensics expert, did the main detective 
      work on a minute piece of timer recovered from the wreckage by Scottish 
      authorities. In a recent book about the Lockerbie investigation, On the 
      Trail of Terror, British journalist David Leppard reports that <b>''Hayes 
      is not prepared to commit himself publicly on whether the bomb that blew 
      up Pan Am 103 was originally made by Khreesat and subsequently modified by 
      timers of the sort found in possession of the Libyans.'' In fact, adds 
      Leppard, ''his authoritative view is that not enough of the bomb's timing 
      device has been recovered to make a definite judgment about whether it was 
      a dual device containing a barometric switch and a timer, or a single 
      trigger device, which was activated by just a timer.'' </b><br>
      <br>
      James M. Shaughnessy, Pan Am's lead defense lawyer, has tried to drive a 
      wedge into this opening left by Hayes, thereby casting further doubt on 
      Libya's responsibility for the bombing. Britain's High Court ruled that 
      Pan Am's lawyers could depose Hayes. <b>However, in a last-minute legal 
      maneuver by the Scottish authorities, the deposition was blocked for 
      reasons of national security.</b> Pan Am's lawyers are now appealing that 
      decision. <br>
      <br>
      But regardless of the bomb's design, al-Kassar still didn't know how and 
      when Jibril planned to use it. A Mossad agent, according to Aviv, first 
      tipped off U.S. and West German intelligence agents that a terrorist 
      attack would be made on an American passenger plane departing from 
      Frankfurt on or about Dec. 18. Al-Kassar quickly figured out that Pan Am 
      Flight 103 was the most likely target and, playing both sides of the 
      fence, notified the COREA unit. His warning corroborated an earlier bomb 
      threat, involving an unspecified Pan Am flight from Frankfurt, telephoned 
      to the U.S. embassy in Helsinki. <br>
      <br>
      Precisely how a rogue bag containing the bomb eluded the Frankfurt airport 
      security system, Aviv doesn't know. Presumably this required the help of 
      baggage handlers there. So in January 1990 he and a former U.S. Army 
      polygraphist flew to Frankfurt, accompanied by Shaughnessy. At the 
      Sheraton Conference Center, adjoining the airport, the polygraphist 
      administered lie-detector tests to Pan Am baggage handlers Kilin Caslan 
      Tuzcu and Roland O'Neill. Pan Am had determined that they were the only 
      ones who were in a position to switch suitcases and place the bomb-laden 
      bag aboard Flight 103. <br>
      <br>
      Tuzcu took the test three times, and O'Neill took it twice. As the 
      polygraphist later testified before a federal grand jury in Washington, 
      Tuzcu ''was not truthful when he said he did not switch the suitcases.'' 
      The polygraphist also told the grand jury, ''It is my opinion that Roland 
      O'Neill wasn't truthful when he stated he did not see the suitcase being 
      switched, and when he stated that he did not know what was in the switched 
      suitcase.'' The two men continued to claim ignorance of a baggage switch.
      <br>
      <br>
      After flunking their lie-detector tests, both were sent on a bogus errand 
      by Pan Am to London, where it was assumed they would be arrested. But 
      British authorities refused to even interrogate the pair. According to 
      Leppard, Tuzcu and O'Neill were simply ''scapegoats'' and were never 
      ''considered serious suspects.'' They returned to Frankfurt that same 
      night. <br>
      <br>
      If the bomb-laden luggage replaced an innocent bag, what happened to the 
      displaced suitcase? On Dec. 21, 1988, the day of the bombing, one of Pan 
      Am's Berlin-based pilots was about to head home to Seattle, Washington, 
      for Christmas when he received orders to fly to Karachi first. He had with 
      him two identical Samsonite suitcases full of presents. At the Berlin 
      airport, he asked Pan Am to send them directly to Seattle. ''Rush'' tags, 
      marked for Flights 637 to Frankfurt, 107 to London and 123 to Seattle, 
      were affixed to the bags. <br>
      <br>
      It so happened that the flight from Berlin to Frankfurt was delayed. While 
      all the passengers ultimately made the connection to London, <b>11 
      suitcases, including the pilot's two bags, remained behind in Frankfurt</b>. 
      They were entered into the airport computer system and rerouted via the 
      Pan Am flight. But only one of the pilot's suitcases was recovered at 
      Lockerbie. The other had been mysteriously left behind in Frankfurt, and 
      arrived safely in Seattle a day later. That story, which TIME has 
      corroborated, doesn't prove Pan Am's claim that terrorists used al-Kassar's 
      drug pipeline to pull a suitcase switch in Frankfurt. But it does support 
      the theory that a rogue bag was inserted into the automated 
      baggage-control system, as the secret FBI report indicates was possible.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>TO GATHER FURTHER EVIDENCE that the bomb was not contained in an 
      unaccompanied bag from Malta, Pan Am lawyer Shaughnessy recently 
      interviewed under oath 20 officials who were in Malta on Dec. 21, 1988, 
      including the airport security commander, the bomb-disposal engineer who 
      inspected all the baggage, the general manager of ground operations of Air 
      Malta, the head loader of Flight 180 and the three check-in agents. Their 
      records showed that no unaccompanied suitcases were put aboard the flight, 
      and some of the staff Shaughnessy interviewed are prepared to testify 
      under oath that there was no bag that day destined for Pan Am Flight 103.
      <br>
      </b><br>
      Although Shaughnessy subpoenaed the FBI, CIA, DEA and four other 
      government agencies for all documents pertaining to both the bombing of 
      Flight 103 and the narcotics sting operation, he has been repeatedly 
      rebuffed by the Justice Department for reasons of national security. Even 
      so, with the help of investigators hired after Aviv, he has managed to 
      obtain some of the documents needed to defend Pan Am's insurers in the 
      trial scheduled to begin April 27 at the U.S. District Court for the 
      Eastern District of New York. The stakes are enormous, and the incentive 
      is high for Shaughnessy to demonstrate the government's responsibility for 
      the bombing. In addition to defending against the compensation claims of 
      $7 billion, he is bringing a claim against the government for failing to 
      give warning that Pan Am had been targeted by the terrorists. <br>
      <br>
      The man who has been Shaughnessy's key witness in these proceedings is 
      hiding in fear of his life in a small town in Europe. His real name is 
      Lester Knox Coleman III, although as a former spy for the DIA and DEA he 
      was known as Thomas Leavy and by the code name Benjamin B. A year ago, the 
      stockily built, bearded Coleman filed an affidavit describing the 
      narcotics sting operation that Shaughnessy claims was infiltrated by 
      Jibril. <br>
      <br>
      It wasn't until July 1990, when Coleman spotted a newspaper picture of one 
      of the Pan Am victims and recognized the young Lebanese as one of his 
      drug-running informants, that he realized he might be of assistance to Pan 
      Am. He was also looking for work. Two months earlier he had been 
      deactivated by the DIA after being arrested by the FBI for using his DIA 
      cover name, Thomas Leavy, on a passport application. Coleman claims that 
      the DIA instructed him to do this. <b>''But such trumped-up charges are 
      frequently used to keep spooks quiet,''</b> says A. Ernest Fitzgerald, a 
      Pentagon whistle-blower and a director of the Fund for Constitutional 
      Government in Washington, which has been looking into Coleman's case. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Coleman spent three days in jail. His official pretrial services 
      report, filed with the U.S. District Court of Illinois for the Northern 
      District, began, ''Although Mr. Coleman's employment history sounds quite 
      improbable, information he gave has proven to be true.''</b> <br>
      <br>
      Raised in Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia, Coleman, now 48, was recruited by 
      the DIA and assigned to the still classified humint (Human Intelligence) 
      MC-10 operation in the Middle East. In early 1987 he was transferred from 
      Lebanon to Cyprus, where he began his work for the DEA. However, he says 
      he was instructed not to inform the DEA there of his role as a DIA 
      undercover agent. By this time even the DIA suspected that the 
      freewheeling narcotics sting operation was getting out of hand. <br>
      <br>
      <b>In Nicosia, Coleman saw the supposedly controlled shipments of heroin, 
      called kourah in Lebanon -- inspiration for the CIA operation's code name 
      COREA -- grow into a torrent.</b> The drugs were delivered by couriers who 
      arrived on the overnight ferry from the Lebanese port of Jounieh. After 
      receiving their travel orders from the DEA, the couriers were escorted to 
      the Larnaca airport by the Cypriot national police and sent on their way 
      to Frankfurt and other European transit points. The DEA testified at 
      hearings in Washington that no ''controlled deliveries'' of drugs through 
      Frankfurt were made in 1988. <br>
      <br>
      Coleman's DEA front in Nicosia, called the Eurame Trading Co. Ltd., was 
      located on the top floor of a high-rise apartment near the U.S. embassy. 
      He says the intelligence agency paid him with unsigned Visa traveler's 
      checks issued by B.C.C.I. in Luxembourg. Additionally, the DEA country 
      attache in Cyprus, Michael Hurley, kept a drawer full of cash in his 
      office at the embassy, which he parceled out to Coleman and to a parade of 
      confidential informants, known by such nicknames as ''Rambo Dreamer,'' 
      ''Taxi George'' and ''Fadi the Captain.'' <b>Hurley admitted in a Justice 
      Department affidavit that he paid Coleman $74,000 for information. </b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>The informants, Coleman reported, were under the control of Ibrahim el-Jorr. 
      ''He was a Wild West character who wore cowboy boots and tooled around in 
      a Chevy with expired Texas plates,'' he says. ''I was told (by el-Jorr)) 
      that in the Frankfurt airport the suitcases containing the narcotics were 
      put on flights to the U.S. by agents or other sources working in the 
      baggage area. From my personal observation, Germany's BKA (Bundeskriminalamt, 
      the German federal police) was also involved, as was Her Majesty's Customs 
      and Excise service in the United Kingdom.'' </b><br>
      <br>
      After deciding to become a witness for Pan Am, Coleman phoned a friend, 
      Hartmut Mayer, a German intelligence agent in Cyprus, and asked if he knew 
      how the bomb got aboard Flight 103. Mayer suggested calling a ''Mr. 
      Harwick'' and a ''Mr. Pinsdorf,'' who Mayer said were running the 
      investigation at the Frankfurt airport. ''I spoke with Pinsdorf,'' says 
      Coleman. ''From his conversation I learned that BKA had serious concerns 
      that the drug sting operation originating in Cyprus had caused the bomb to 
      be placed on the Pan Am plane.'' Mayer and Pinsdorf gave depositions last 
      year at the request of Pan Am. But the German Federal Ministry of the 
      Interior ruled they couldn't discuss law-enforcement matters relating to 
      other nations. Mayer did say he knew Coleman. <br>
      <br>
      ''It took three informants just to keep tabs on al-Kassar,'' claims 
      Coleman. He said the informants reported that al-Kassar and the Syrian 
      President's brother Rifaat Assad were taking over drug production in 
      Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, under protection of the Syrian army. Coleman also 
      says he learned that the principal European transfer point for their 
      heroin shipments was the Frankfurt airport. <br>
      <br>
      <b>In December 1988 al-Kassar picked up some news that threatened to shut 
      down his smuggling operation. Charles McKee's counterterrorist team in 
      Beirut that was investigating the possible rescue of the nine American 
      hostages had got wind of his CIA connection. The team was outraged that 
      the COREA unit in Wiesbaden was doing business with a Syrian who had close 
      terrorist connections and might endanger their planned rescue attempt. <br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Besides McKee, a key member of the team was Matthew Gannon, 34, the 
      CIA's deputy station chief in Beirut and a rising star in the agency. 
      After venting their anger to the CIA in Langley about al-Kassar, McKee and 
      Gannon were further upset by headquarters' failure to respond. Its silence 
      was surprising because Gannon's father-in-law Thomas Twetten, who now 
      commands the CIA's worldwide spy network, was then chief of Middle East 
      operations based in Langley. He was also Ollie North's CIA contact. </b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>MCKEE AND GANNON, joined by three other members of the team, decided to 
      fly back to Virginia unannounced and expose the COREA unit's secret deal 
      with al-Kassar. They packed $500,000 in cash provided for their rescue 
      mission, as well as maps and photographs of the secret locations where the 
      hostages were being held. Then the five-man team booked seats on Pan Am 
      103 out of London, arranging to fly there on a connecting flight from 
      Cyprus. </b><br>
      <b><br>
      McKee's mother says she is sure her son's sudden decision to fly home was 
      not known to his superiors in Virginia. ''This was the first time Chuck 
      ever telephoned me from Beirut,'' she says. ''I was flabbergasted. 'Meet 
      me at the Pittsburgh airport tomorrow night,' he said. 'It's a surprise.' 
      Always before he would wait until he was back in Virginia to call and say 
      he was coming home.'' </b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Apparently the team's movements were being tracked by the Iranians. A 
      story that appeared in the Arabic newspaper Al-Dustur on May 22, 1989, 
      disclosed that the terrorists set out to kill McKee and his team because 
      of their planned hostage-rescue attempt. The author, Ali Nuri Zadeh, 
      reported that ''an American agent known as David Love-Boy (he meant 
      Lovejoy), who had struck bargains on weapons to the benefit of Iran,'' 
      passed information to the Iranian embassy in Beirut about the team's 
      travel plans. Reported to be a onetime State Department security officer, 
      Lovejoy is alleged to have become a double agent with CIA connections in 
      Libya. His CIA code name was said to be ''Nutcracker.''&nbsp;</b><br>
      <br>
      Lawyer Shaughnessy uncovered similar evidence. His affidavit, filed with 
      the federal district court in Brooklyn, New York, asserts that in November 
      and December 1988 the U.S. government intercepted a series of telephone 
      calls from Lovejoy to the Iranian charge d'affaires in Beirut advising him 
      of the team's movements. Lovejoy's last call came on Dec. 20, allegedly 
      informing the Iranians that the team would be on Pan Am Flight 103 the 
      following day. <br>
      <br>
      <b>In his book, Lockerbie: The Tragedy of Flight 103, Scottish radio 
      reporter David Johnston disclosed that British army searches of the 
      wreckage recovered more than $500,000 cash, believed to belong to the 
      hostage-rescue team, and what appeared to be a detailed plan of a building 
      in Beirut, with two crosses marking the location of the hostages. The map 
      also pinpointed the positions of sentries guarding the building and 
      contained a description of how the building might be taken. </b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Johnston also described how CIA agents helicoptered into Lockerbie 
      shortly after the crash seeking the remnants of McKee's suitcase. ''Having 
      found part of their quarry,'' he wrote, ''the CIA had no intention of 
      following the exacting rules of evidence employed by the Scottish police. 
      They took the suitcase and its contents into the chopper and flew with it 
      to an unknown destination.'' Several days later the empty suitcase was 
      returned to the same spot, where Johnston reported that it was ''found'' 
      by two British Transport Police officers, ''who in their ignorance were 
      quite happy to sign statements about the case's discovery.'' </b><br>

      </font><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Richard Gazarik, a 
      reporter for the Greensburg, Pennsylvania, Tribune-Review, spent many 
      months probing the major's secret mission. He found, hidden inside the 
      lining of McKee's wallet, which was retrieved from the Pan Am wreckage and 
      returned to his mother, what he assumes was McKee's code name, Chuck 
      Capone, and the gangster code names (Nelson, Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde) 
      of the other team members. </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">

      The theory that Jibril targeted Flight 103 in order to kill the 
      hostage-rescue team is supported by two independent intelligence experts. 
      M. Gene Wheaton, a retired U.S. military-intelligence officer with 17 
      years' duty in the Middle East, sees chilling similarities between the 
      Lockerbie crash and the suspicious DC-8 crash in Gander, Newfoundland, 
      which killed 248 American soldiers in 1985. Wheaton is serving as 
      investigator for the families of the victims of that crash. ''A couple of 
      my old black ops buddies in the Pentagon believe the Pan Am bombers were 
      gunning for McKee's hostage-rescue team,'' he says. ''But they were told 
      to shift the focus of their investigation because it revealed an 
      embarrassing breakdown in security.'' </font></b>
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The FBI says it investigated the 
      theory that McKee's team was targeted and found no evidence to support it.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Victor Marchetti, former executive assistant to the CIA's deputy 
      director and co-author of The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence, believes 
      that the presence of the team on Flight 103 is a clue that should not be 
      ignored. His contacts at Langley agree. ''It's like the loose thread of a 
      sweater,'' he says. ''Pull on it, and the whole thing may unravel.'' In 
      any case, Marchetti believes the bombing of Flight 103 could have been 
      avoided. ''The Mossad knew about it and didn't give proper warning,'' he 
      says. ''The CIA knew about it and screwed up.'' </b><br>
      <br>
      The CIA may still be trying to find out more information about why McKee 
      and Gannon suddenly decided to fly home. Last year three CIA agents, 
      reportedly following up on their hostage-rescue mission, were shot dead in 
      a Berlin hotel while waiting to meet a Palestinian informant. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Beulah McKee has given up trying to find out if Pan Am's bombers were 
      after her son, although she says, ''The government's secrecy can't close 
      off my mind.'' Twice she called and questioned Gannon's widow Susan, who 
      like her husband and her father Tom Twetten worked for the CIA. ''The last 
      time, I was accused of opening my mouth too much,'' says Mrs. McKee. </b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Yet memories die hard, and mothers never quite get accustomed to losing a 
      child. Beulah McKee keeps her son's bedroom all tidied up, as if she still 
      expected him to come home. His pictures, diplomas, military awards, even 
      his chrome-plated bowie knife, decorate the walls. In a cardboard carton 
      under the made-up bed are the heavily censored service records of her son, 
      which may contain the secret of why Pan Am 103 was blown out of the sky 
      over Scotland. </font></p>
