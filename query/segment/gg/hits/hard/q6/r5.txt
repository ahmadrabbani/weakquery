Who is Elevator?    previous chapter  |   next chapter     After chatting for quite a long time, I told her to check on me and went home. It was nice to see her again and she had made my weekend interesting just by being there.  Monday now, a whole new day. I went for lectures and from there decided to go to the library to catch up on some stuff when I ran into Dayo.  "Honey, Whatz up now?" "I'm fine o, you nko?" I said.  I noticed his eyes were darting left, right, center. He wasn't really interested in me "Dayo, what's the matter with you?" "I have something confidential to tell you.   After leaving your room the other day, I saw a friend of mine who has seen us together.  He said a guy named elevator claims you're his babe.  "Who the hell is elevator?" I asked "I don't know, but be careful. I can't really see you anymore because I don't want any stress" He said. After sharing this "confidential" stuff, he left and went on his way. "Who is elevator? Why am I being haunted? Maybe its Tunde, he looks like a cult boy" Different things I thought of, I was confused and tired.   I boned the library after that and went to Bisola's Dept.  I saw her in one of the classes-taking lecture, I waited outside for her to finish. She came out Immediately the lecturer Left.  "Honey, what is it?" She asked walking towards me". "You saw me?" I asked "Of course I did. I saw you looking in what is it?" "Look, I'm tired of this school. Am I that fine? I asked  She bursted out in laughter "What is bringing all these now?" She asked "I'm serious. Someone is threatening my friends and warning them to stay away from me" "Calm down, you're saying a cult boy is claiming you" "Thank God you're smart, I can't think of any guy except the guy is in a cult" "Can you think of anybody?" "Only Tunde, Dayo told me that the guy is known as elevator," I said "Are you sure Dayo is not lying?" "I don't think so, and he was also in a hurry.  He didn't greet me with his usual approach. You needed to have seen him, he was looking uncomfortable.  "So whoever this elevator is does he want to elevate you into his life" "This brought a smile to my face" "Are you ever serious?" I asked "Come on get him out of your head. We don't even need the likes of Dayo, let's go and eat at bush path. I'll pay.  "Thanks for cheering me up. But don't you have any more lectures?" "I do but will I now leave you alone, no way let me get my bag".  Bisola is a darling, she stayed with me throughout the day. Till the guys came at night, we call them the Crew.  We have Chima, Sunday, Seyi, Tayo and Tunde.  They usually come and visit us, We all gist till late. On Tuesday, we found out that they all go and read in Arts block, so we decided to join them.  We met two good friends of the crew. One was plump and the other Slim, Bisola and I named the Slim one (Ralph) to Timon and the plump one (Segun) to Pumbah.  Both of them were clowns, Seyi told me that the plump one was born around the same time with him, in the same hospital, and their mothers were roommates and both related.  Segun's mother works at Unilag while Seyi's father works at lag. Ralph and Segun were something else, they kept us holding our ribs. We couldn't go to read till 1:00am, anyway we left for Arts block finally.  We read for like an hour and the guys showed me the rooftop from there I could see almost everywhere.  I could see the Third Mainland Bridge which went on and on. Gosh, it was beautiful. Even the Sky was lovely. God is awesome, all his creations are perfect.  We got to the room at 5:30pm, less I forget something funny happened today.  I was toasted by Chinma, but the way it was done, nobody really noticed and when I said no, he said it was okay.  I paused slightly because I was wondering if I was being passed round. I'm not a conventional beauty. Immediately, we got to the room I told Bisola and she said I should ignore them.  On Thursday, Angel told me She has a boyfriend and she'll like me to meet him later in the day.  Guess who it was Timon. She was shocked when I called him Timon and of course Timon was not alone, the whole crew was with him.  She was introduced to them and we all started gisting as usual Bisola has gone to mark register at her boyfriend's house.  Seyi called me aside and asked me if I had an answer for him and I told him we'll discuss about it on the rooftop.  Tunde told me to take him back to my room and cook for him.  So Seyi, Tayo and Timon followed me back to my room. I fried plantain for them and and bought them drinks.  They all enjoyed themselves and gave rib-cracking jokes that made my roommates like them. we all went back outside by then Bisola was around.  Getting to Art Block, Sunday held on to Bisola while Seyi pulled me to the Rooftop.    previous chapter  |   next chapter       Bring Back Memories?
