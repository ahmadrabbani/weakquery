                               <p class="title">Litigating the Cult-Related Child Custody Case</p>
<p class="author">
<a target="_blank" href="../infoserv_profile/kandel_randy.asp" style="text-decoration: none">Randy Frances Kandel, J. D., Ph.D.</a></p>
                               <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Successful litigation of child custody cases in which one 
parent is a member of a destructive cult requires strategies and techniques that 
focus the court's attention on the fact that the hierarchical totalitarian 
structure of the cult controls both parent and child.&nbsp; The cult leaders 
substantially usurp the parenting function; their dictates replace the 
decision-making usually exercised by custodial parents; and the parent-child 
interaction is embedded in and inseparable from cult practices and 
relationships.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Child custody litigation between a cult member parent and 
an independent parent can involve a broader judicial inquiry into the techniques 
of mind, lifestyle, and environmental control practiced by destructive cults 
than virtually any other type of cult-related litigation.&nbsp; In cases involving 
adults, the courts have been generally reluctant to recognize causes of action 
grounded in psychological manipulation (such as &quot;coercive persuasion&quot; or &quot;mind 
control&quot;) because of the law's strong presumption that adults act autonomously 
and voluntarily.&nbsp; But no comparable presumption attaches to children when 
custody is at issue.&nbsp; To the contrary, the very purpose of child custody 
litigation is to decide on an environment (human and otherwise) that will be &quot;in 
the best interests of the child.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The court may evaluate the rules and relationships to which 
the child will be exposed common-sensibly and qualitatively (if not 
judgmentally) precisely with regard to the formative effect they may have on the 
child's developing psyche.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The statutory recitation of the factors to be considered in 
determining child custody varies slightly from state to state, but it 
universally involves broad, sweeping inquiry into the relative &quot;fitness&quot; of the 
parents emotionally, financially, and otherwise.&nbsp; Testimony on the daily ritual 
and minutiae of cult life, including how and with whom the child spends time, 
the extent and nature of parental interaction, the methods of child discipline, 
the child's education, and the non-parental adults who will interact with the 
child, is relevant to the determination.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the past several years, our firm and others have 
represented in child custody matters several former members of the so-called 
&quot;psychotherapeutic community&quot; known as the Sullivan Institute for Research in 
Psychoanalysis/Fourth Wall Repertory Company.&nbsp; This entity, based in New York 
City's Upper West Side, has approximately 250 members, most of whom are 
well-educated professionals in their late twenties to early forties.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The core of the Sullivanian theory is that the nuclear 
family and all strong dyadic relationships are psychologically destructive, and 
that parent-child bonds in particular are the root of all evil and the 
mainspring of psychological maladjustment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Members must break off contact with parents and friends 
&quot;outside&quot; and learn to loathe them; avoid forming intense dyadic relationships; 
and maintain ongoing sexual relationships with other group members.&nbsp; Marriages, 
although permitted for reasons of convenience, financial and the like, are 
non-monogamous, non-co residential, and frequently formed and dissolved at the 
dictates of the leadership.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The heart of the various profit and not-for-profit entities 
under which the Sullivanians operate is a &quot;psychotherapeutic institute&quot; to which 
the leaders and both licenses and lay therapists belong.&nbsp; All members are 
required to be in perpetual therapy with these therapists.&nbsp; According to former 
Sullivanians, the therapists control members' lives through manipulation of the 
transference phenomenon.&nbsp; Transference is the process by which the patient 
transfers onto the therapist many of the primary reactions, feelings, and 
thoughts that were once associated with other highly significant persons in the 
patient's life.&nbsp; Responsibly handled transference can be therapeutic, but it 
offers the therapist an opportunity to exercise great control over the patient.&nbsp; 
Unscrupulously handled transference can become a medium to foster cult 
allegiance and a means to the authoritarian domination of cult members.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Former Sullivanian therapists admit that therapeutic 
confidentiality is broken down in the group.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Therapy sessions are a means for the leaders to extract 
information and exert control.&nbsp; The therapists themselves report the substance 
of therapy sessions to their own supervisors, the Sullivanian leaders.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Most Sullivanians, married or unmarried, live with other 
Sullivanians in sex-segregated apartments.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Peer pressure, encouraged and directed by Sullivanian 
therapists, reinforces conformity to Sullivanian mores and dictates of the 
leaders. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Not surprisingly, Sullivanian child-raising practices 
manifest Sullivanian ideology.&nbsp; As described by former Sullivanians, the 
therapist's consent is needed to bear or raise a child.&nbsp; Sometimes it is 
decided, prior to birth or even conception, that the biological parent and the 
nurturing parent will be different people.&nbsp; From infancy the cult applies 
stringent measures to interfere with the development of loving bonds between 
mother and baby.&nbsp; Full-time babysitters or &quot;committees&quot; of cult members, under 
the authoritarian direction of the cult leader, are assigned to each child and 
act as guards and gossips to ward off any show of maternal affection.&nbsp; Others 
who are excessively demonstrative toward their children may have their babies 
taken from them for foster-parenting or adoption by other group members.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the child grows, a continuous round of adults other than 
the parent or full-time babysitter supervises the child for some brief period of 
time each day so that parents may be literally forced to &quot;date&quot; their own 
children.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Parents must discuss every aspect of their children's lives 
with their therapists, and the children themselves are frequently in therapy 
from an early age.&nbsp; Thus, every aspect of the children's lives — what they shall 
do, who their friends shall be, where they shall go to school, how they shall 
spend vacations — comes directly under the purview and control of the 
therapist/leaders</p>
<h2>Litigation Strategies and Tactics</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">In one of the custody proceedings, which are the basis for 
this report, our firm represented a mother who had been forbidden contact with 
her infant daughter by the Sullivanian leadership.&nbsp; The mother took the child 
and left the Sullivanian community, at which point the father/husband petitioned 
for a writ of habeas corpus.&nbsp; In the other two proceedings, handled by other 
counsel not of our firm, fathers who are former Sullivanians sought custody of 
their children from their ex-wives who continue to live in the Sullivanian 
community.&nbsp; Based upon our experience and observations, we can suggest certain 
general guidelines for attorneys to consider in similar situations.</p>
<h2>Emphasize the Destructive and Dangerous Influence of the Cult on the Child</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Make the court aware at the outset that the adversary is 
the cult and that the cult is dangerous.&nbsp; In the case handled by my firm, this 
issue emerged immediately when we refused to disclose the address of the mother 
and child.&nbsp; We maintained that confidentiality was needed because of the risk of 
physically and psychologically dangerous reprisals from the Sullivanians.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Indeed, courts have held quite uniformly that the 
whereabouts of a spouse and children are protected by the attorney-client 
privilege where one spouse fears the other's violent propensities or where the 
marital situation appears to be potentially explosive.&nbsp; We argued that 
confidentiality was even more necessary in a case, like the one in question, 
where the wife/mother fears not merely an estranged husband, but the combined 
force of a cult group which operates through physical violence and psychological 
terrorism.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When we refused to reveal the mother's address, the court 
held several days of evidentiary hearings on the dangerous aspects of the 
Sullivanians — placing the destructiveness of the cult environment into issue 
prior to any concerns about individual parental fitness.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Former Sullivanians testified about physical and 
psychological control within the group.&nbsp; Former Sullivanian parents testified 
that they had been forced to surrender their children or were required to send 
them to boarding school at ages as young as three years.&nbsp; Young adults who had 
been raised within the Sullivanians testified about the suffering they had 
experienced.&nbsp; (One Sullivanian-raised young adult had become a teenage 
alcoholic.&nbsp; Another had committed suicide.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although never formally concluded because our case was 
happily resolved, these hearings set the stage for all further proceedings.&nbsp; 
Most significantly through these hearings, a kind of &quot;longitudinal evidence&quot; was 
brought into the case by which the destructiveness of Sullivanian child-raising 
patterns was demonstrated through testimony of the psychological injuries 
suffered by other children raised in the group. </p>
<h2>Focus on Control: The Cult Leader as the Real Parent </h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bring the cult leaders into the case.&nbsp; Put them on the 
stand and let them expose themselves through their own testimony.&nbsp; If 
procedurally possible (for example, as respondents on a habeas corpus petition), 
join the cult leaders or significant members as parties in the case.&nbsp; Their 
&quot;parenting&quot; role is a genuine and material factor in determining custody.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In child custody litigation, the issue of relative parental 
&quot;fitness&quot; can be dispositive.&nbsp; A fit parent is a parent capable of making 
independent, mature, autonomous, and rational decisions about the raising of a 
child, and also capable of acting upon those decisions.&nbsp; Parents who must &quot;clear 
everything&quot; with their therapist or who must respond blindly to the dictates of 
the leadership do not meet this standard.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fortunately, during the course of extended litigation the 
authoritarian control of the cult leaders will frequently make itself evident.&nbsp; 
For example, decisions to move all the cult children from one school to another 
or from one summer camp to another; or to permit or deny all cult children to 
engage in a certain activity or to play with other children, betray the absence 
of responsible, independent parenting.&nbsp; Bring all such examples of controlled 
group action to the court's attention.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The fact of leadership control is related to the issue of 
parents' rights as well as parental fitness.&nbsp; The right to decide how one's 
child shall be raised is not necessarily equivalent to the right to turn over to 
someone else decisions about how one's child shall be raised.&nbsp; While both 
parents may be assumed at the outset to have equal rights to their children, the 
same is not true of parental surrogates whom the cult may appoint.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Sullivanian cases particularly, the practices of 
appointing perpetual babysitters, rotating cult members in turn to care for the 
baby, and limiting the parents' own time with the child, were arguments against 
cult parents' having primary custody.&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount of time and the amount of 
quality time that a parent is able to spend with a child are usually factors in 
deciding the ordinary custody case.&nbsp; Thus, the extraordinarily small amount of 
private quality time a cult parent spends with a child may be of particular 
significance.</p>
<h2>Keep Multiple Cases Before the Same Judge</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Few things can be more advantageous in cult-related custody 
litigation than to keep several cases involving the same cult before the same 
judge.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First, the repetition and expansion of contextual 
information that can thus be provided to the court makes a strong evidentiary 
statement on the quality and nature of a child's life in a cult.&nbsp; Besides, cults 
are exposed when the same patterns of oddities and abuse in child-raising 
matters and husband-wife relations occur again and again in multiple cases.&nbsp; 
From an evidentiary perspective, trying multiple cult cases before the same 
judge permits evidence on the often bizarre similarities in the lives of 
different cult children — revealing and proving a cult pattern and practice that 
might otherwise appear to be vagaries and idiosyncrasies of parental 
personalities.&nbsp; When various cult cases are assigned to a single judge, the 
court can gain a thorough understanding of the manipulations of the cult 
leadership, which may be impossible to perceive by viewing any single case in 
isolation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Second, assignment to the same judge makes possible 
cooperation and collaboration among the various non-cult parents and their 
attorneys.&nbsp; Working through such a &quot;quasi-class action&quot; structure allows 
non-cult parties to meet the power of the cult with their own power.&nbsp; All 
attorneys, and sometimes all parties, may attend judicial conferences.&nbsp; It 
enables non-cult parties to combine financial resources against the vastly 
greater financial power of the cult by sharing the costs of trial preparation, 
expert witness fees, and clerical costs.&nbsp; Use of the same judge, in addition, 
allows an intimate support network to form among the non-cult parties, which is 
essential to maintaining stamina, spirits, and morale in the face of cult 
forces' continuing psychological influence.&nbsp; Ex-cult members leave behind both 
an authoritarian structure which has dictated their lifestyles and decisions and 
all the friendships and emotional attachments they have known for years.&nbsp; They 
re-enter a world which is strange, threatening, lonely, and confusing without 
the supportive reintegrative network of other former cult members.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The assignment of three Sullivanian custody cases to the 
same judge proved to be a markedly effective tool.&nbsp; Fortunately, only a month 
before the commencement of the Sullivanian cases, a massive reorganization of 
litigation management took place in the New York State judicial system.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Under the new organization, known as the IAS (Individual 
Assignment System), each case is assigned at the outset to one particular judge 
who thereafter hears all motions, matters and evidentiary hearings, and conducts 
all conferences related to the cases.&nbsp; Initially, cases are randomly assigned to 
judges by computer.&nbsp; However, by attorney request or administrative decision, 
cases may be assigned to a particular judge before whom other related matters 
are pending.&nbsp; When first requesting judicial attention, an attorney is required 
to indicate such other related pending cases.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first two Sullivanian cases were assigned to the same 
judge without objection from the Sullivanians.&nbsp; Although the actions were not 
formally consolidated, the cases were combined for the purposes of the 
evidentiary hearings, and most judicial conferences were also informally 
combined.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the third ex-Sullivanian parent requested assignment 
to the same judge, the issue was hotly although belatedly litigated by counsel 
for the Sullivanian parent.&nbsp; The independent parents won a substantial victory 
when the administrative law judge ruled that all Sullivanian cases were to be 
handled by the same judge.&nbsp; Finding such assignment to be of the very essence of 
the IAS system, the administrative judge stated that a major benefit of the IAS 
is the ability to eliminate duplication and waste of judicial resources by 
assigning cases arising from the same subject matter to the same judge.&nbsp; He 
found a sufficient legal and factual nexus among the cases to warrant assigning 
the Sullivanian custody cases to the same judge.</p>
<h2>Consolidate Actions for Hearings and Trial</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">An even more powerful tactic is the actual consolidation of 
actions for hearing and trial.&nbsp; Such consolidation allows evidentiary emphasis 
to be placed dramatically on the acts and attitudes of the cult.&nbsp; Moreover, it 
enables clients to more easily bear the costs of protracted litigation by 
sharing them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Sullivanian cases, the issue of consolidation came 
up twice.&nbsp; The first time was at the very beginning of the litigation during the 
hearings on the dangerousness of the cult.&nbsp; Consolidation was essentially de 
facto.&nbsp; While hearings were proceeding in regard to the confidentiality of the 
mother's address in the first action, a second former cult parent was attacked, 
allegedly by a member of the cult's security forces who was reputed to be a 
black belt in karate.&nbsp; As the two cases were proceeding in tandem before the 
same judge, the hearings, almost as a matter of course, came to apply to both 
cases.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The attempt at consolidation was less successful the second 
time.&nbsp; The two ex-Sullivanian fathers, who by that time were both represented by 
the same attorney and were living in a house they had rented together, made a 
formal motion to consolidate their trials.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a published opinion, the New York State Supreme Court 
(Walter Shackman, J.) held:&nbsp; &quot;[T]he Court finds a joint trial is inappropriate.&nbsp; 
In each case the Court is separately concerned with the psychological 
environment surrounding the children as a result of the interaction between 
their parents, each parent and child/children, and between the children and 
significant other adults and children with whom the children interact as well as 
the physical environment in which they reside.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Combining these two cases would make the Court's task of 
evaluating the evidence pertaining to the individuals involved more difficult.&nbsp; 
While the Court is cognizant of the fact that a joint trial would reduce the 
fathers' cost of litigation, the Court does not believe it would result in a 
more economical use of judicial resources, for it deprives the parties of the 
individual attention each case warrants.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Furthermore, a joint trial might create the impression that 
the court &quot;should&quot; or &quot;would&quot; decide the issues of custody and visitation 
similarly, without acknowledging that the Court is concerned with two separate 
family units.&nbsp; Having decided to have children together, these parents have 
implicitly committed themselves in an ongoing relationship to each other insofar 
as it relates to the best interest of their children.&nbsp; This relationship is now 
distinct from any communal relationship the parents once shared, and must 
necessarily grow to encompass the differing needs and preferences of maturing 
children.&nbsp; The Court finds a separate trial better fosters autonomous parenting 
and independent reflection upon parental guidance and the children's 
well-being.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Notably, this decision was reached despite the fact that 
the common questions of fact were unusually great.&nbsp; The children did not merely 
share a similar life with their mothers among the Sullivanians; they shared a 
similar life with their fathers as well.&nbsp; The fathers shared a house with a 
common living space and outdoor play space for the children, and frequently 
engaged in activities together when the children resided with them.&nbsp; Moreover, 
the judge was familiar with these arrangements and had presided over the 
entirety of the three cases.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The consolidation decision perhaps exemplifies the 
difficulties which may be encountered by an attorney who attempts in any sense 
to &quot;litigate against the cult&quot; rather than exposing the cult activities which 
may have detrimental to the best interests of the child.</p>
<h2>Make Special Use of Expert Witnesses</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">In planning a trial strategy, attorneys should consider and 
select among the multiple possible uses of psychologists, psychiatrists, 
anthropologists, and sociologists as expert witnesses.&nbsp; Testimony by social and 
behavioral scientists who have done primary research on a cult, or clinicians 
who have treated former cult members and their families, can be invaluable in 
providing information on the patterns of child-raising within the cult.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If such experts testify in court, caution them to 
concentrate on facts about the social organization, culture, and interpersonal 
dynamics in the group and about the psychological consequences of these 
factors.&nbsp; Avoid the battle of theories that is subject to First Amendment 
protection and which creates a tangle of ideologies while raising issues of 
admissibility under the Frye test.&nbsp; As first enunciated in the case of Frye v. 
United States, 293 F. 1013 (CADC 1923), the rule holds that &quot;in admitting expert 
testimony deduced from a well-recognized scientific principle or discovery, the 
thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have 
gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.&quot;&nbsp; The 
test can be used to exclude expert testimony in the behavioral and social 
sciences where the nature of academic debate often makes it impossible to meet 
the &quot;general acceptance&quot; standard.&nbsp; But do elicit sufficient ethnographic detail 
to assist the clinical experts in giving their testimony.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Such experts may also be helpful out of court in providing 
ethnographic and theoretical information to clinical experts.&nbsp; The body of 
scientific literature has welled to substantial proportions, and any attorney 
litigating cult cases is well advised to become familiar with some of this 
material whether or not its authors are to testify as expert witnesses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The use of clinical experts must, almost necessarily, be 
more extensive than in a typical matrimonial action.&nbsp; The usual psychiatric or 
psychological evaluative consultation is done in the expert's office and 
typically consists of interviews with the parents and children and observations 
of parent-child interaction.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a cult-related case this is simply not enough.&nbsp; The 
inquiry must not end with the question of whether the parent-child relationship 
is good or bad because much of the psychologically destructive quality of life 
in a cult comes from the mental and psychological control exercised by the cult 
leadership.&nbsp; The expert evaluation must include other issues such as: </p>
                               <ol>
                                 <li>
                                 <p class="Numbers">who controls and directs the parent's functioning and decision-making;</p>
                                 </li>
                                 <li>
                                 <p class="Numbers">who, other than the parent, disciplines and cares for the child;</p>
                                 </li>
                                 <li>
                                 <p class="Numbers">how much time parents spend with their children and what is the nature of 
the interaction;</p></li>
                                 <li>
                                 <p class="Numbers">who, other than the parents, makes decisions about the child's upbringing 
and education, and what is the basis for these decisions.</p></li>
                               </ol>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ideally, the expert witness should have a substantial 
opportunity to observe the parent-child interaction in ethnographic context (at 
home in the cult interacting with cult leaders and other cult members who are 
significant adults in the child's life).&nbsp; Alternatively, the expert should have 
the opportunity to testify about the effects of the cult's practices as 
developed through the testimony of others or through information provided by 
research-oriented experts and their scholarly works.</p>
<h2>Enlist the Help and Support of Other Ex-Members</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Individuals who had left the Sullivanians relatively 
recently formed a supportive, informal &quot;re-entry&quot; network of friends and 
associates who were in close and frequent contact with one another.&nbsp; The same is 
true for former members of many other groups.&nbsp; The people in this network 
provided invaluable assistance to both the litigators and the litigants.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They testified as witnesses.&nbsp; They provided volunteer 
clerical services (helping, in a small way, to minimize the inordinate financial 
discrepancies between the wealth of the cult and the budgets of the independent 
parties).&nbsp; And, perhaps most importantly, they provided emotional and practical 
support to the ex-member parent parties during the long ordeal of litigation 
which, for the litigants, meant slowly and painfully breaking with and publicly 
exposing a former total way of life.&nbsp; Non-party former cult members are a 
litigation resource not to be underestimated.</p>
