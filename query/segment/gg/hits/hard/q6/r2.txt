Posted by DSE at 10:55 AM on December 12, 2002 |  Comments (0) |     Grandmaster Ratte' sez:  Jason Scott from  textfiles.com  came down to NYC a couple weeks ago, filming for his  BBS documentary . So we shot an interview in my apartment and ate at the soul-food place around the corner. I got to ramble on about my  Demon Roach Underground BBS and whatnot and it was fun. Here you can see the sock in my pants really well.  Here I am enjoying a stogie and a bubblebath with my pearl-handled revolver and Apple II plus, as I often do.  These are all the shots of my living room and audio/computer crap. Where the uh, 'magic' happens.
