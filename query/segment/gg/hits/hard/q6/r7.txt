What is Mind Control?  Mind Control techniques include: Hypnosis   Inducing a state of high suggestibility by hypnosis, often thinly disguised as relaxation or meditation. Peer Group Pressure   Suppressing doubt and resistance to new ideas by exploiting the need to belong. Love Bombing   Creating a sense of family and belonging through hugging, kissing, touching and flattery. Rejection of Old Values   Accelerating acceptance of new life style by constantly denouncing former values and beliefs. Confusing Doctrine   Encouraging blind acceptance and rejection of logic through complex lectures on an incomprehensible doctrine. Metacommunication   Implanting subliminal messages by stressing certain key words or phrases in long, confusing lectures. Removal of Privacy   Achieving loss of ability to evaluate logically by preventing private contemplation. Time Sense Deprivation   Destroying ability to evaluate information, personal reactions, and body functions in relation to passage of time by removing all clocks and watches. Disinhibition  Encouraging child-like obedience by orchestrating child-like behaviour. Uncompromising Rules   Inducing regression and disorientation by soliciting agreement to seemingly simple rules which regulate mealtimes, bathroom breaks and use of medications. Verbal Abuse   Desensitizing through bombardment with foul and abusive language. Sleep Deprivation and Fatigue   Creating disorientation and vulnerability by prolonging mental an physical activity and withholding adequate rest and sleep. Dress Codes   Removing individuality by demanding conformity to the group dress code. Chanting and Singing   Eliminating non-cult ideas through prolonged group repetition of mind-narrowing chants or phrases. Confession   Encouraging the destruction of individual ego through confession of personal weaknesses and innermost feelings of doubt. Financial Commitment   Achieving increased dependence on the group by 'burning bridges' to the past, through the donation of assets. Finger Pointing   Creating a false sense of righteousness by pointing to the shortcomings of the outside world and other cults. Flaunting Hierarchy   Promoting acceptance of cult authority by promising advancement, power and salvation. Isolation   Inducing loss of reality by physical separation from family, friends, society and rational references. Controlled Approval   Maintaining vulnerability and confusion by alternately rewarding and punishing similar actions. Change of Diet   Creating disorientation and increased susceptibility to emotional arousal by depriving the nervous system of necessary nutrients through the use of special diets and/or fasting. Games   Inducing dependence on the group by introducing games with obscure rules. No Questions   Accomplishing automatic acceptance of beliefs by discouraging questions. Guilt   Reinforcing the need for 'salvation' by exaggerating the sins of the former lifestyles. Fear   Maintaining loyalty and obedience to the group by threatening soul, life or limb for the slightest 'negative' thought, word or deed. Replacement of Relationships   Destroying pre-cult families by arranging cult marriages and 'families'. Some of the above techniques used in isolation are not necessarily harmful in and of themselves. However, in a psychologically coercive cult environment, they are usually used en masse, in extreme ways and for prolonged periods of time.       Legal Info
