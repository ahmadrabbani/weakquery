The 24-year-old freestyle skier told NBC's "Today" Monday that she was on a trail near her home town of Missoula, Mont., Friday morning when she saw some cubs scramble up a tree. The mother bear ran at her. Haas tried to run away, but was not fast enough. She turned around to face the bear and it lunged at her. Haas hit the bear in the head and threw a rock at it before the bear attacked her again. Haas says she backed away and the bear eventually lost interest. -- WATCH Haas on "Today":     FOLLOW HUFFPOST  GREEN ON  Facebook:  Like        70K        Twitter:          Get Alerts   CONTRIBUTE TO THIS STORY    Send Corrections     Send us a Link     Contact us      Send a Tip     Send Photos/Videos     Comment             Animals  Video   NEW YORK (AP) -- Former U.S. Ski Team member Ani Haas says she feels fortunate to have suffered just scratches to her left arm and chest when she encountered a black bear while running in western Mont...
