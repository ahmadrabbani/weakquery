(or in Spanish translation, <A HREF="olor.htm">Olor</A>, traducido por Mar&iacute;a
Garc&iacute;a)</H2>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Among the many things women are asked to worry about, <FONT
 COLOR="#FF0000">odor emanating from her genitals</FONT> is a big one. Advertising
in American magazines since at least the 1920s has whispered - in huge,
frightening <A HREF="Lysol48.htm">ads</A> - that <FONT COLOR="#006600">an
unwashed vulva and an undouched vagina can end a marriage, even for the
woman whose meals are tasty and on time, whose house is orderly and dust
free, and whose kids are better than the neighbor's.</FONT></H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">And then you menstruate.</FONT></H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Surely, this is a great, but awful truth for most women,
these words of Simone de Beauvoir, in <FONT COLOR="#006600">The Second Sex</FONT>:</H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Menstrual blood . . . represents the
essence of femininity.</FONT></H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>To have something most women at least dislike, and sometimes
hate - read many <A HREF="stopmen.htm">comments</A> about this - represent
their sex, certainly puts them in their place almost everywhere in the world.
Men strutted about in decorated codpieces 400-500 years ago in Europe, parading
their penises, but when have women flown their menstruous rags? (Actually,
some European women seem to have let their menstrual blood flow without
any absorbing material, at least in England and Germany, and I suspect elsewhere.
<A HREF="pastgerm.htm">Read</A> about this.)</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Rachel Sobel, an undergraduate at Harvard, now [July 1998]
  doing research at MUM about the tampon industry for her senior thesis,
  mentioned that menstrual odor was once considered seductive in the odor-rich
  18th century.</H4>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Ads embarrass Americans into being odor free by buying underarm
  odor killers, menstrual pads with baking soda, <I>tampons</I> with deodorants,
  etc.</H4>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>But after reading Alain Corbin's The Foul and the Fragrant:
  Odor and the French Social Imagination (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University
  Press, 1986) she writes that</H4>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <H4 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#006600">in 18th century France, menses was
    considered to be 'impregnated with subtle vapors transmitted by the essence
    of life.' These were particularly seducing, as a woman was 'dispersing
    seductive effluvia' and 'making an appeal for fertilization.' Thus, societies
    have celebrated the seductive aroma of menstruation, rather than stifled
    [it].</FONT></H4>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>And Dr. Richard Lambert, in <FONT COLOR="#006600">Sex Facts
for Women</FONT>, says <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">menstrual blood smells like
the</FONT> <A HREF="sexfact3.htm">marigold</A>, a flower - a further connection
between menstruation and flowers (another being advertising's likening the
Tassette menstrual cup to a <A HREF="CupTaset.htm">tulip</A>).<A NAME="anchor467052"></A></H4>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="anchor1222711"></A>So <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">what
causes the characteristic smell of menstruation? Is it like a </FONT><A
HREF="home944.htm">marigold</A><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">?</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>You're not going to like this.</H4>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Bacteria from the anus - oh, I'll just say it: they're from
  feces, and are the famous <I>Escherichia coli (E. coli) </I>bacteria -
  eat the blood, cells and tissue running from the uterus and vagina and
  produce the characteristic smell of menstruation.</H4>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Sorry.</H4>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>You say you don't have fecal bacteria in your vagina? <I>Oh,
  ho, ho, yes you DO!</I></H4>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Your basic anus is about an inch (2.54 centimeters) from
  the entrance to the vagina and it's a snap for bacteria to creep that teensy
  distance - or ride on a tampon, cup, pad or inside panties (imagine how
  a thong might do this) or get wiped there with a swipe of toilet paper
  (a good reason to wipe the anus toward the back, not toward the front of
  the body, to minimize the number that do make the trip).</H4>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Now, for most of the month the acid in the vagina - yes,
  helpful bacteria there make lactic acid - ties the hands and feet of those
  little devils by hardly allowing them to reproduce and grow. They and many
  other disease-causing bacteria cannot thrive in the acid.</H4>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>But for a few days each month the vagina, and outside, on
  the vulva, are the perfect places to raise a family! You guessed it: <FONT
   COLOR="#FF0000">during menstruation</FONT>! Blood, cells and secretions
  from the uterus and vagina make the vagina more alkaline and the bacteria
  feel right at home. Oh, girl! And they gorge gourmet whenever they want!</H4>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>So what about female folks who don't menstruate, like prepubescent
  girls and postmenopausal women? Fecal bacteria can live in their vaginas
  without producing that characteristic smell because the bacterial and hormonal
  setup is different from that of menstruating women.<A NAME="anchor123142"></A></H4>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>O.K., if there are so many bacteria in the vagina during
  menstruation <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">is it SAFE TO HAVE SEX?</FONT></H4>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>If by sex you mean a penis doing his job, and <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">if
  both people have no infectious diseases</FONT>, for example HIV and hepatitis,
  then it's generally safe.</H4>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>But there is one huge exception: women who get <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">urinary
  tract infections</FONT>. The entrance to the bladder is right above the
  opening of the vagina and the penis can rub the swarming bacteria right
  into the tube that leads to the bladder, which is much shorter than a male's,
  one reason women get UTIs much more often than men.</H4>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Douches and deodorants can also change the environment of
  the vagina and allow dangerous bacteria to grow there. (Read about <A

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>In March 2010 a British biologist wrote me about his ability
to <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">detect some women who are menstruating</FONT>,
not all, by &quot;<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">like a sneeze on the way in my nose/nasal
area.&quot; He was not attracted to those women, quite the contrary. </FONT>But
read his account:</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4 ALIGN=LEFT>&quot;I was just listening to your <A HREF="http://www.keeper.com/finley.html">interview</A>
  on the web. Here is something you might consider but may, I think, be too
  controversial. I assure you I am a professional biologist and I have considered
  this subject over many years. I have also mentioned it to many girlfriends
  and proved it to their satisfaction on several occasions. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">I
  can detect when some ladies are having a period. </FONT>I will call it
  a 'smell' but it isn't - <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">it is not unpleasant but
  it is distinct - it is a 'feeling' - a tickle - like a sneeze on the way
  in my nose/nasal area.</FONT> I have been able to do it all my life (although
  when I was young I didn't know what it was). I assumed that everybody could
  do it. The most common time it happens is at the <FONT COLOR="#006600">check-out
  at the supermarket</FONT>. I can only do it with about 10% or less of females.
  To give an example - I walked into an office where my girlfriend was working
  and my nose tickled. Later I said to her &quot;Of course you were all having
  your period.&quot; <FONT COLOR="#006600">She was appalled </FONT>- but
  I explained my ability and she admitted that all the girls (4) in the office
  had <A HREF="mensy71a.htm">synchronised their cycles.</A> Although I could
  not detect hers I could detect one or more of the other ladies. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Here
  is the interesting thing. I have never dated a lady who's period I could
  detect in this way. I am, somehow, 'put-off' by ladies whose cycle I could
  detect.</FONT> Furthermore, I could do it with my mother - &quot;You smell
  funny!&quot; (no sisters). The possible biological explanation of this
  is actually quite well established. Many mammals select mates that are
  'different' - it is a form of out-breeding (to avoid in-breeding depression).
  <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The argument is that breeding with mates that have
  a very similar immune-systems will detrimental to the off-spring.</FONT>
  It is known in several mammals that this outbreeding to avoid similarity
  in HLA antigens is done by smell. Be assured that I am not talking about
  incest here - in the population of human females some, by chance, will
  have similar HLA antigens to me and it would be advantageous if I avoided
  mating with them. I offer you this as an observation. I wonder if any other
  males can do it?&quot;</H4>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>The writer referred me to a 2007 article and study about
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">lap dancers</FONT> that concluded</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>While ovulating - and therefore the most fertile - strippers
  made an average of $30 per hour more than menstruating women and $15 per
  hour more than women elsewhere in their cycles. Women on the pill - who
  typically don't ovulate - made significantly less than naturally cycling
  women overall and had no &quot;estrus earning peak.&quot; (Rebecca Skloot,
  <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/magazine/09lapdance.html">Lap-Dance
  Science</A>, 9 December 2007, New York Times)</B></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>That seems to agree with the finding (somewhere) that ovulating
women feel sexier and are attracted to more masculine-looking men.</B></P>

<H3><HR WIDTH="50%"><A NAME="anchor1474463"></A></H3>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>And again, somewhat on the subject,<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
Sally Price</FONT>, the Dittman Professor of American Studies at the College
of William and Mary,<FONT SIZE=+1> </FONT><A HREF="olnews51.htm">sent</A><FONT
 SIZE=+1> </FONT>this museum her essay &quot;The Curse's Blessing,&quot;
(from Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, volume XIV, No. 2) which <FONT
 COLOR="#FF0000">calls into question the popular idea that menstrual huts
provided relief from male restrictions</FONT> and maybe even a chance to
have a little &quot;fun&quot; on the side, if you get what I mean.</H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Professor Price, who spent many menstrual periods in menstrual
huts in Suriname, felt the isolation and discomfort women have experienced
for hundreds - thousands? - of years in similar situations. (See a <A HREF=

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>. . . . Sound scientific documentation supporting such anecdotal,
gender-biased malarkey [that animals are attracted to menstrual odor, etc.]
is hard to find; actually one is more likely to run across studies concluding
quite the opposite.<A NAME="anchor794220"></A></H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>UnBEARable . . .</H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Such a study was published in the Journal of Wildlife Management
in 1991 in answer to concerns regarding <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">black bears'
attraction to menstrual odors</FONT> [Finley added the red] and subsequent
attacks on female hikers. The death of two menstruating women attacked by
grizzlies in Glacier National Park in 1967 apparently prompted the government
to print brochures warning women to avoid bear country during periods of
active menstruation. However, the examination of factors surrounding hundreds
of grizzly and black bear attacks produced neither evidence that supported
a causal relation between human menstruation and attacks nor revealed any
published records concerning black bear responses to menstrual blood. The
U.S. Forest Service conducted a series of experiments (Rogers et al., 1991)
which tested the responses of both male and female black bears to human
menstrual odors. The first experiment involved the spin-cast introduction
of 15 used tampons (in clusters of 5) to adult male black bears foraging
in a garbage dump. Each presentation, therefore, gave the bears a choice
between the garbage and tampons. If the bears ate (like they did the garbage),
closely sniffed, or rolled on the tampons, then they were considered to
have paid attention to the tampons. Of 22 presentations, the bears ignored
the used tampons 20 times (twice casual sniffs were observed), effectively
preferring the garbage in every instance. In a second experiment, seven
bears feeding on piles of corn were offered groups of six used tampons.
Six of the bears sniffed the tampons and then returned to their piles of
corn. A yearling male tasted one of the tampons, quickly dropped it and
returned to the corn.</H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>A third experiment placed four used tampons, an unused tampon,
a tampon soaked in non-menstrual human blood, and a tampon containing rendered
beef fat in the middle of a heavily traveled bear path with the used tampons
interspersed among the others. Ten out of ten bears ate only the tampons
soaked in beef fat. In a fourth experiment, women on different days of their
period accompanied and contacted bears who were accustomed to human interaction
and were known to investigate attractive odors. Eleven encounters involved
women wearing tampons and one crazy woman wearing clothing through which
her menstrual blood was soaking. Of the twelve encounters with the women,
the ten bears did not pay any attention to the lower torsos of the women.
Another woman wearing external pads during two of her menstrual cycles hand-fed
four female bears and walked within two meters of adult male bears during
bear mating season and did not receive any attention. Rogers et al. (1991)
concluded that the lack of interest of the bears to menstrual odors does
not prove that such odors are never attractive to bears <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">(similar
experiments resulted in tampon feasts by polar bears lacking attractive
buffets) [Finley added the red]</FONT>; however, menstrual odors essentially
were ignored.</H4>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Darwin's Sexy Nose [Vaginal Odors Change During the Menstrual
Cycle and Vary in Their Appeal to Males]</H3>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Bear attacks, among other less-desired responses to a woman's
menstrual perfume, do not seem to be frequent consequences of the olfactory
influences involving human menstruation. Many scientific journals suggest
that human males, on the other hand, respond to vaginal cyclic scents. Doty
et al. (1975) described a study which concluded that &quot;the odors of
human vaginal secretions vary in both intensity and pleasantness across
the stages of the menstrual cycle.&quot; Men were asked to rate both the
intensity and pleasantness of odors arising from used tampons from consecutive
phases of the menstrual cycle. It was found that even though there was considerable
variation across cycles from the same donor, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">men claimed
secretions from pre-ovulatory and ovulatory stages were less intense and
more pleasant than during the other phases [Finley added the red]</FONT>.
Data fell short of providing substantial support to the idea that particular
staged menstrual odors were &quot;attractive&quot; to men, and due to heterogeneity
of results it &quot;is unlikely that humans can use vaginal odors reliably
to determine the general time of ovulation.&quot;</H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>&quot;Unlikely&quot; does not mean impossible, and the logical
jump made (before or after) with studies such as the aforementioned is to
attempt to bridge some evolutionary gap between man and ape, providing a
reasonable explanation as to the importance of menstrual olfactory cues
in communicating courtship rituals and defining timed mating behaviors in
early man. In the December 1974 edition of Science, scientists from Emory
University School of Medicine published the volatile fatty acid content
as determined by gas chromatography of 682 vaginal samples from human females.
They noted that fatty acid content increased during the late follicular
phase of the menstrual cycle and declined progressively during the late
luteal phase. The same volatile aliphatic acids found in the human samples
(i.e. acetic, propanoic, methylpropanoic, butanoic, methylbutanoic, and
methylpentanoic) have been found ubiquitously in the vaginal secretions
of many primate species such as the rhesus monkey, anubis baboon, patas
monkey, pigtail monkey, crab-eating monkey, and squirrel monkey. Although
scant information is available on the importance of these compounds in humans,
say Michael et al. (1974), &quot;The same substances possess sex-attractant
properties in other primates.&quot; Interestingly, it was noted that similar
attraction reactions resulted when human vaginal secretions were exposed
to rhesus monkeys, and that women on oral contraceptives had lower acid
amounts and showed no rhythmic changes during their cycle. There is evidence
to suggest in rhesus monkeys that other odorous, non-aliphatic compounds
present in vaginal secretions serve as distinct cues to males during the
preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle (Goldfoot, 1981).</H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>So did man at one time in his early development use scent,
like today's primates, as an important reproductive communicator? Acceptance
of the argument further implies that somewhere along the evolutionary line
of man, menstrual olfactory cues became obsolete [?]. The subsequent weakening
of human's conscious attraction to vaginal odors resulted in the degeneration
of sense of smell found in humans today. Of course, whether one makes the
leap connecting primate olfactory cues to early man's equally intrinsic
ability to detect estrous of Cro-magnon Jane or not, it must be accepted
that supportive, documented science just does not exist in a less correlative
form.</H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>The menstrual cycle not only produces odors, rumored to serve
as attractive cues, but reacts to external odors as well. One often hears
of females living in close proximity undergoing the synchronization of their
menstruation onset times. In an article published by Russell et al. (1980),
it was stated that &quot;menstrual synchrony is not due to changes in food,
awareness of menstrual timing or lunar cycles, and [it is] suggested that
the only significant factors seem to be the amount of time the women spend
together and the lengths of their cycles.&quot; They conducted a really
cool experiment in an attempt to demonstrate if the olfactory cues of one
very &quot;regular&quot; woman could influence the timing of menstrual onset
in other women.</H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Eleven women, whose mean age was 28.5 years, none of whom
were lesbians or were taking oral contraceptives, volunteered to have an
odor placed on their upper lip three times a week during a four month period.
The odor was extracted from the axillary region (the armpit!) of a female
donor with a history of a very regular menstrual cycle. She did not use
underarm deodorant or perfumed soap, nor was she allowed to wash under her
arms during the odor gathering period. Odor collection involved having the
donor wear 4X4 cotton pads under her arms for 24 hours. The subjects had
the pads rubbed on their upper lips and asked not to wash their faces for
six hours. The group of control subjects received the same treatment, with
the exception that they did not receive the odor. Test subjects and control
subjects had no knowledge as to which group they belonged.</H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>The results indicated with statistical significance of p
&lt; 0.01 that odors from one woman can influence the the menstrual cycle
of another. The mean difference in days between the menstrual onset of tested
subjects and the donor at the beginning of the experiment was 9.2 days.
This average decreased to 3.4 days by the end of the experiment with four
of the five subjects synchronizing to within one day of the donor's onset.
The control group averaged 8.0 days from the donor's onset in the pre-treatment
month and 9.2 days in the post-treatment month.</H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>The possibility was noted that &quot;the mechanism of [odor]
transfer did not involve the nose at all, but diffusion of chemical compounds
through the skin which may occur when the sample was placed on the subject's
upper lip.&quot; If compounds placed under the nose were volatile and the
subject unaware of their presence, then can one properly use the term &quot;odor&quot;
anyway?</H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>The olfactory influences on the menstrual cycle of crab-eating
monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) have been studied along the same lines as
human synch experiments. Wallis et al. (1986) placed twelve female monkeys
in adjacent cages allowing for the occurrence of physical contact. Only
one of the females had a history of regularly-timed menstruation. A control
set was established in the same manner with the exception that cages were
situated far enough apart so no physical contact was possible. Within the
course of the six-month study, the experimental subjects with irregular
flow tended to normalize, although cycle synchronization was not observed
as a trend. In the control group, irregular subjects continued to experience
abnormally long cycles. The authors suggested, &quot;Close physical contact
may serve to transmit chemical and/or hormonal cues that can normalize the
menstrual cycle of crab-eating monkeys.&quot;</H4>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Are <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sharks</FONT> Attracted to Menstrual

M.D. called <A HREF="http://www.scubadiving.com/9500/9506menstruation.html">Diving
and Menstruation,</A> copyright 1994-1996 Rodale Press. There's much more
on that page worth reading, including potential health problems caused by
diving during menstruation.</I></H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Over the course of their periods, most women lose between
50 to 150 ml (one-quarter to three-quarters cup) of blood and tissue. While
this is not a physiologically significant amount, many women fear that this
discharge may attract sharks. The truth is that women divers are attacked
by sharks less often than men are. In his book Diving and Subaquatic Medicine,
Dr. Carl Edmonds suggests that this may in part be due to a repellent effect
of some component of the menstrual blood that is released. While this has
not been formally tested, it is fair to say that the danger of shark attack
from diving during one's period is substantially less than what results
from other activities, such as spear fishing.<BR>
