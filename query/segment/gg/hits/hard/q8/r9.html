            filed against GSMNP in <br>
            2000 bear-attack death of Cosby woman</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><br>
            <font size="4">GATLINBURG &#150; The family of Glenda Bradley has 
            filed a $3.5 million wrongful death claim against the Great Smoky 
            Mountain National Park claiming the National Park Service made &quot;mistakes 
            in its handling of Ms. Bradley&#146;s death.&quot; The 50-year-old 
            Cosby resident and Sevier County teacher died last year after Park 
            officials say a 112-pound bear sow and her yearling cub mauled her 
            during a hike along the Little River Trail and the intersection of 
            the Goshen Prong Trail. Bradley and her former husband Ralph Hill 
            had gone to the Park that day so he could fish while Bradley hiked. 
            According to reports, the two were attempting to reconcile their relationship. 
            Bradley was regarded as an experienced hiker and knew the trails she 
            was walking. <br>
            The claim, which was filed with the United States Department of Interior 
            in Washington, D.C. by Knoxville attorney Sidney Gilreath, alleges 
            that the Park was negligent in the resource management of the black 
            bears and reportedly had evidence that the bears exhibited behavior 
            that should have warned the Rangers of potential trouble. Rangers 
            at the scene of the incident killed both the sow and cub. The carcasses 
            of the bears as well as the body of Glenda Ann Bradley were autopsied 
            and evidence allegedly showed that the bears had fed on Ms. Bradley.<br>
            The incident marked the first time in the history of the National 
            Park Service that someone had been killed by a black bear, which led 
            to the formation of a committee to study the issue and recommend any 
            changes to help avoid future incidents when visitors encountered black 
            bears in their natural habitat.<br>
            The final report on the incident was released earlier this year and 
            cleared the Ranger&#146;s activities at the scene of the incident 
            and his refusal to fire on the bears immediately upon his arrival 
            at the scene for fear of hitting bystanders or other Rangers responding 
            to scene. Officials in their final report also stated that there would 
            be changes made in the way the they inform hikers of encountering 
            wildlife in the Smoky Mountains at all visitor&#146;s centers. In 
            addition, the Park has revised back country signs warning people about 
            bear encounters and is devoting designated time in their law enforcement 
            training program to problem bear management. According to earlier 
            reports from the Park Service following the incident, the bears were 
            known to officials as part of an ongoing study of wildlife in the 
            Park, but had exhibited no behavior considered unusual for a bear 
            in the wild.<br>
            National Park officials would not make a statement on the wrongful 
            death claim as a matter of policy regarding comments on pending litigation. 
            The Knoxville attorney has indicated if he cannot get a settlement 
            from the Department of Interior, he will file a lawsuit in Federal 
            Court</font></p>

              GSMNP releases final report on <br>
              2000 bear attack fatality</b></font></p>
            <p align="left"><br>
              GATLINBURG &#150; Officials at the Great Smoky Mountain National 
              Park released their final report last week on the May 2000 death 
              of Sevier County teacher Glenda Ann Bradley.<br>
              Bradley, who was regarded as an experienced hiker in the Smoky Mountains, 
              was believed to have been attacked by two bears during a hike along 
              the Little River Trail at the intersection with Goshen Prong Trail. 
              Rangers with GSMNP later arrived on the scene and killed both the 
              sow and the cub believed to have attacked Bradley. It marked the 
              first time in the history of the National Park Service that someone 
              had died as a result of a black bear attack. <br>
              Officials say their investigation and the autopsy results performed 
              by East Tennessee State University&#146;s College of Medicine &quot;confirmed 
              the preliminary findings that Bradley died of injuries due to bear 
              attack.&quot; The manner of death was ruled as an accident. <br>
              The Board of Inquiry Report also detailed the Park&#146;s response 
              to the incident and listed a series of eight recommended action 
              that the Park is taking in response to the attack. The changes are 
              mainly in the areas of staff training, tightened procedures for 
              reporting and responding to bear incidents and methods of educating 
              visitors on how to respond to various types of bear encounters. 
              <br>
              The following recommendation were made:<br>
              1. The February 1993 Black Bear Management Guidelines should be 
              revised and updated. While no major changes are required, the guideline 
              has become dated. Information and insight gained from the Bradley 
              fatality would be a useful addition to the handbook. <br>
              2. The Trail Map should be revised. The &quot;Bears and You&quot; 
              section should include advice and recommendations of what to do 
              if encountered by a bear. More attention should be given to evaluation 
              of a bear&#146;s behavior during an encounter with guidance for 
              the proper response.<br>
              3. Back country signs should be revised to include the potential 
              for bear encounters. These signs advise visitors of the potential 
              danger of bears. The bear warning sign has been revised to include 
              language that bear attacks on humans have occurred.<br>
              4. The ranger division should devote a segment of its annual law 
              enforcement training to problem bear management. Wildlife staff 
              should review the protocols for identifying and managing recurring 
              problem bear behavior. <br>
              5. The Black Bear Management Report has been revised and reaffirmed. 
              The procedure for reporting after-hour/weekend observations has 
              been reaffirmed to ensure that bear reports are received by the 
              appropriate resource management staff in a timely manner. <br>
              6. The Resources Management and Science Division should identify 
              one person who will be assigned as a point of contact for problem 
              bear reports. This employee will coordinate his response with the 
              wildlife biologist and ranger staff.<br>
              7. Other Park information distributed in visitor centers, the communications 
              center and by Resource Education personnel should be modified to 
              include the lessons learned from the Bradley incident. Written materials 
              should describe the appropriate measures to take when encountered 
              by a bear. Research by Professor Steve Herrero and others clearly 
              show that during an encounter people should respond according to 
              specific types of bear behavior. More attention should be given 
              to evaluation of a bear&#146;s behavior during an encounter with 
              guidance for the proper visitor response. <br>
              8. The Resources Management &amp; Science Division should resume 
              sponsorship of an annual bear management workshop in the spring 
              of the year. Employees from all operating divisions would benefit 
              from open discussion of bear management issues as b ears emerge 
              from their dens concurrent with the arrival of Spring break campers 
              and backpackers.<br>
              &quot;In short,&quot; said one Park official, &quot;black bears 
              can be aggressive and people need to know how to act and react when 
              encountering a black bear. Never get too close to one and always 
              try to watch from a good distance. A black bear is a wild animal 
              and will act like one. &quot; </p>
