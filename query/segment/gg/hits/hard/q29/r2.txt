A tropical storm is an intense  thunderstorm , categorized by extremely low pressure and cyclonic wind rotation, which usually develops in the tropics. Because of the cyclonic action, the term  tropical cyclone  is sometimes used interchangeably with tropical storm. This use of the term is technically incorrect.  Tropical cyclone  actually refers to an entire class of weather systems, including tropical depressions, tropical storms, and even hurricanes.  A tropical storm is classified in much the same way as a hurricane. The sustained  wind speed is a determining factor. Wind speeds within a tropical storm must be between 39 and 73 mph (63 to 118 kph). A tropical storm that hits land, especially in a heavily settled region, may cause quite a bit of damage. Those that don't cause destruction, however, are an important part of nature. They carry heat from lower latitudes near the  equator to higher latitudes.  Starting in 1953, all tropical storms were given names. It was much easier to speak and to understand a name, especially over a radio, than it was to give or receive the logistical identification of a storm. There is a list of names to be used each year, decided in advance by the National Hurricane Center. Since 1979, men and women's names have been used in an alternating pattern. Before that time, only women's names were used.  The name lists are recycled and used again every six years. The World Meteorological Organization may vote to remove a name from the lists permanently if a storm has caused extreme damage or loss of life, making continued use of the name potentially offensive. The names that start with X, Y, or Z may be interchanged every other year, due to the fact that there are few names beginning with these letters. There are no names that start with the letters U or Q. If there are more storms than names in the list for a given year, storms occurring after the year's list has been exhausted will be named for letters of the Greek alphabet, for example, Alpha or Beta. A  tropical storm watch is an advisory made when tropical storm conditions are probable in a specific area within 36 hours. Pay close attention to weather forecasts and to the storms strength, location and path. If a  tropical storm warning  is issued, storm conditions are imminent within the next 24 hours. When a warning has been issued, proper safety precautions should be taken immediately.   Related Videos   Related wiseGEEK Articles  What Is an Anticyclone?   What Happened on October 22?

I don't think it could go to CO. The remains of the cyclone could. but that would be showers and t-storms and maybe some wind.
