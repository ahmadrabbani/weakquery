Both states have declared states of emergency near the coast, with Lee expected to make landfall in the next 48 hours with 65mph winds, reports  CNN . The real hazard is expected to be the accompanying rain, however, with some areas expecting up to 20 inches.  "What we do know is there's high wind, there is a lot of rain and it's going slow," said New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. "That's not a good prescription for the city of New Orleans should it come this way." The city is expecting about 10 inches of rain over the next few days.

It is forecast that we should experience the worst part of the storm by 12:00 p.m. today.  If you do not hear from me, it is because we have lost power (Is that a good or bad thing?...lol). Until further notice, let the rain come down...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtXrVyMbf1A      Spudsy  Sep 2, 2011 10:22 PM CDT    Too bad this storm couldn't track to the west and relieve some of that Texas drought.  Of course, according to Bachmann, god is still punishing Texas with this drought for electing Rick Perry.       stroker  Sep 2, 2011 4:48 PM CDT    States rights! Paul is correct: why should my taxes clean up the mess of those who ought not to be living in that disaster area? ps: Bet you didn't know this. In 1929 Congress passed a law exempting the Army Corps of Engineers from law shuits. Now imagine: why give a hoot if you do the job right or not? you are not liable!

Though other zoo animals were evacuated, officials say no one anticipated how quickly the floodwaters would rise, and that euthanization was the most humane choice. But across cyberspace, angry commenters wondered why the zoo, which had two days to prepare, did not evacuate the bison earlier, the  Philadelphia Inquirer reports.  USA Today adds that the floods currently overwhelming the Northeast are the worst in nearly 40 years.

Nate, formed in the southern Gulf of Mexico, is expected to drop anywhere from 2 to 8 inches of rain on parts of Mexico, and could start moving north by tomorrow—by which point it could also strengthen into a hurricane.

Flash flooding expected from drenching storm  (AP) - As Katia regained hurricane status, the center of Tropical Storm Lee stretched across the central Gulf Coast early today, dumping torrential rains that threatened flooding in low-lying communities in a foreshadowing of what cities further inland could face in coming days. Lee's center crawled ashore in Louisiana before dawn after the vast, soggy storm system spent hours during the weekend hovering in the northernmost Gulf of Mexico— knocking out power to 32,000 before it even made landfall . The storm's slow crawl to the north gave more time for its drenching rain bands to pelt a wide swath of vulnerable coastline, raising the flood threat.  More»    32K Lose Power in Tropical Storm Lee  Rain totals along coast could reach 10 to 15 inches  (AP) - Bands of heavy rain and strong wind gusts from Tropical Storm Lee knocked out power to thousands in south Louisiana and Mississippi today and prompted evacuations in bayou towns like Jean Lafitte, where water lapped at several front doors. The sluggish storm stalled just before making landfall, and threatened to dump more than a foot of rain across the northern Gulf Coast and into the Southeast in coming days. No injuries were reported and there were only scattered reports of water entering low-lying homes and businesses.

What could become Tropical Storm Lee prompted warnings from Mississippi to Texas, the AP reports, with heavy rain expected over southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama through Sunday.
