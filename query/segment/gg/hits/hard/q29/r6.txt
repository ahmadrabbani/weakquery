Its path, however, remains unlikely to bring anything more than storm-borne swells and rip-current conditions to South Florida as it aims instead for Bermuda and later the Carolinas. At 11 p.m. today, Katia's highest sustained winds were 105 mph - up about 5 mph from this morning - as it moved at nearly 13 mph along a northwest path 385 miles north-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands, according to the National Hurricane Center. It could become a major hurricane - Category 3 status, with winds of 111 mph or more - by Monday. It was a tropical storm as recently as Saturday evening. Katia expected to continue in a northwest direction through Tuesday, although its speed may drop. As of 11 p.m., it wasn't seen as having much chance of landfall with the United States before next weekend. Forecasters say Katia's eventual interaction with weakening Tropical Storm Lee creates uncertainty in long-term forecasts on Katia's direction and intensity. Hurricane-force winds are extending 45 miles from Katia's center, the hurricane center said. Tropical storm force winds extend 175 miles from Katia's center. Dangerous storm swells could begin to arrive in the next two or three days along the beaches of Florida and the remainder of the coastal Southeast, as well as in Bermuda, the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas. Lee was downgraded to a tropical depression at 10 p.m. Sunday, about 60 miles east-southeast of Alexandria, La. It's moving to the east-northeast at 7 mph. Forecasters expect it to head northeast tonight and cross southern Louisiana and Mississippi by Monday night. Maximum sustained winds decreased to 35 mph and were expected to weaken over the next day. Lee could spawn a few tornadoes tonight and Monday over an area stretching from the Florida Panhandle to southern Louisiana, forecasters said. The storm's slow crawl to the north gave more time for its drenching rain bands to pelt a wide swath of vulnerable coastline, raising the flood threat. At least 6 to 10 inches of rain had fallen in some spots along the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts, and the National Weather Service warned there was a threat of extensive flooding and flash floods because of the storm's slow, meandering jog inland. The drenching rainbands were expected to head northward into the Tennessee Valley later in the week as forecasters warned that 10 to 15 inches of rain were possible along the central Gulf Coast and up to 20 inches in isolated spots. No injuries were reported so far from the storm. But even before Lee swept ashore, there were scattered instances of water entering low-lying homes and businesses in Louisiana's bayou country, a region of fast-eroding wetlands long vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms. The storm prompted evacuations in bayou towns such as Jean Lafitte. Thousands were without power. To the east, coastal businesses were suffering. Alabama beaches that would normally be packed for the Labor Day holiday were largely empty, and rough seas closed the Port of Mobile. Mississippi's coastal casinos, however, were open and reporting brisk business. Officials in some suburban and rural areas of southeast Louisiana reported more than 10 inches had already fallen even before Lee reached the coast. In New Orleans, sporadic downpours caused some street flooding Saturday, but pumps were sucking up the water and sending it into Lake Pontchartrain. Officials said the levees were doing their job in the city that is still recovering from the deadly Hurricane Katrina a half decade ago. Tropical storm warnings were in effect this morning from Destin, in Florida's panhandle, west to Sabine Pass, Texas. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

I find it to be a very useful tool in tracking weather. Even better than the weather channel. I have added it to my facebook page & receive text alerts also.Keep up the great work. I can only hope that the next storm surge picks up that rock that Mike is living under. Jean 9:24 AM, 9/4/2011  REPORT ABUSE     "Less slogs on shore".  What in the he11 is THAT supposed to mean? what? 9:32 AM, 9/4/2011  REPORT ABUSE     BREAKING: Katia will be a Category 2 Hurricane as of the 11AM Update  http://nowhurricane.com/2011/katia-...  Zach 9:42 AM, 9/4/2011  REPORT ABUSE     Katia expected to become regain strength??  According to the NHC, Katia REGAINED hurricane status on their 5A report (maybe before- I was asleep @2A)  As far as where she may strike, the 'cone of uncertainty' includes neither Bermuda nor the Carolinas at present.  Why do your inept reporters(?) insist on making up their own stories instead of sticking to fact?  Oh - I got a kick out of the "Less slogs ashore" headline also. The staff awoke and finally fixed this error. Don't rely on Post news 9:53 AM, 9/4/2011  REPORT ABUSE     Click on the picture in the upper left. It takes you to stormpulse.com. The graphic of Katia they show is the official US Hurricane prediction for 5 days out.  The US Hurricane Center makes this prediction based on their interpretation of about 10 computer models that have been developed by various people/companies/universities that predict where hurricanes will go and when, and how strong.  ZZ 11:00 AM, 9/4/2011  REPORT ABUSE     The US Hurricane Center caps their official forecast at 5 days and they use a cone to show a margin of error or uncertainty.  Many of the computer models they use make predictions beyond 5 days. After you have arrived at stormpulse.com and are looking at the track of Katia, look at the upper right of the screen. Click the 'ON' radio button of the 2nd choice, "Forecast Models" and you will see all the models individually plotted on one map.
