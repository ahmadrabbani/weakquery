T ropical storms are formed over sea R ight up the warm air rises to where the storm will be O ver and above the sea the rainclouds will form P eople see the signs of the coming storm I n spirals the air begins to spin C louds move and the rains begin A bove land the storm is nigh L ater on we'll be in the eye S trong winds and the storm surge destroy people's homes T o the site of the hurricane, aid does go O rleans was wrecked a few months ago R ound streets and buildings the floodwater flowed M orale in this city was definitely low Poem 2 The formation of a tropical storm Happens when the water is warm It rises in the air and then brings very low pressure It forms heavy rain clouds and then the air begins to spread out Cold air sinks down to create the 'eye' This is the formation of a tropical storm in the sky This was on the back of the 'mapping from memory' group exercise showing the formation of tropical storms    posted by Kenny O'Donnell @  11:59 PM         << Home           ↑ Grab this Headline Animator     ↑ Grab this Headline Animator  Categories Atmosphere  Biosphere  Glaciation  Limestone  Coasts  Rivers  Population  Urban  Rural  Industry  Environmental Hazards  Development and Health  Rural Land Resources  Geography General  Games and Quizzes  Writing and Assessment  Advanced Higher  s1 and s2  Other  get blog categories!
