Nie Weiguo, chief of the executive office with the State Council's Three Gorges Project Construction Committee, said the smooth relocation of residents and their well-being will be crucial when evaluating whether the project is a success.  Nie was commenting on a guideline issued by the State Council on May 18 concerning the government's follow-up work on the reservoir.  According to the guideline, the government will increase industrial restructuring, boost employment incentives, and enhance social security coverage for the migrated residents.  The government also vowed to make efforts to protect the environment, improve the long-term mechanisms for geological disaster prevention and better handle the project's impact on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.  The main body of the Three Gorges Dam is located in the town of Sandouping in central Hubei province and was completed in May 2006.  Since 1993 when the project was launched, 1.35 million people have been relocated to make way for the construction of the world's largest hydroelectric dam.  China is also building a Three Gorges Museum in southwestern Chongqing municipality to salute the relocated residents for their sacrifices for the greater good. The museum is scheduled to open at the end of the year.   Related stories China explores using fish to tackle water pollution in Three Gorges Reservoir  2011-05-25  China's Three Gorges Dam accelerates water discharge to relieve downstream drought  2011-05-20  China builds museum to mark massive Three Gorges Dam migration  2011-05-08     Editor: Du Xiaodan | Source: China Daily         Text: A  A  A    Email  Share  |                                Topics  -  Space : Shenzhou-8 returns to Earth  -  Military : U.S. Global Strike weapon  -  Crash : School bus accident in China   -  Disease : Bird flu virus found in S China  -  Recall: Apple recalls 1st-gen iPod nano  -  Festival:  Shanghai Int´l Arts Festival         Hot Videos   view more         Biz »  China revamps corporate tax regime         Culture »  Young dreams light up as movie fund launched         Biz »  China issues details for VAT incentives              Editor's picks   more on tv          Nature and Science   China´s singing desert; A medical puzzle          China Insight   Tibet Series- Made in Tibet          CCTV 9 Documentary   Daming Palace Part 1- Birth of fantasy              Hot Stories   more   Yao Ming "totally lost" in 1st math class    Chinese basketball legend Yao Ming revealed that he did not grasp his first mathematics lesson at all in a speech Wednesday in Beijing.
