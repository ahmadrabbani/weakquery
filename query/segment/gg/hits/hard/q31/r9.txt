The Three Gorges Project has met the management target of zero accidents in both quality of construction projects and safety, and the annual construction of the Three Gorges water-control project had been finished in an all round way. The control of water resources by the Three Gorges water-control project has been under continuous improvement with evident achievement of reduction of flood peak flow during wet season and water replenishment during dry season. The hydropower station reached the designed capacity for the first time, the trial impoundment at the end of wet season reached 171.4 meters. The cargo shipment amount passing the Three Gorges Dam has kept fast growth for the sixth consecutive year.  In 2009, the Three Gorges Reservoir achieved optimum dispatch such as bigger change of water level and advance impoundment before the end of wet season. The incoming flow of the Three Gorges Reservoir during wet season was 12.5% less than the historical average. Measures such as advance impoundment and control the outflow have ensured flood control and appropriate use of water resources in the mid and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and facilitated the achievement of comprehensive benefits of the huge project. The annual generated electricity of the cascade hydropower stations in Three Gorges―Gezhouba Dam section was 96.1 billion kW?h, the maximum output of Three Gorges Dam power plant reached the designed output 18.2 million kW?h for the first time on August 8, safe and steady operation of the generating units of the Three Gorges Dam under full load has been subject to testing. The technical indicators of operation of the Three Gorges Dam ship lock met the design requirement, achieving the overall objective of "safe, orderly, highly efficient and smooth" put forward by the State Council. A total of 74.26 million t cargo passed the ship lock in 2009.  In 2009, the construction of Three Gorges Project achieved the management target of zero quality accident with 100.0% projects meeting the quality requirement and 92.6% being excellent or good quality. The on-going projects of underground power station and ship lifting facilities enjoyed smooth progress with completion of 262000 m3 of concrete pouring, 2453 t of metal structure and electronic machine buried and installed, 7549 t of generator sets installed and 11210 m of consolidation & grouting during 2009.  In 2009, guided by the outlook on scientific development, relevant authorities had facilitated the construction and operation of the Three Gorges Project as well as development of harmonious Dam areas in an all round way. Projects including water & soil conservation have been constructed and completed one after another in accordance with the plan. The project construction, operation of water-control project, and management of Dam areas have reached a new high.
