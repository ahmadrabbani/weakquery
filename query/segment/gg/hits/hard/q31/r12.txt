Why does China say it needs such a big dam? How does the Three Gorges Dam provide a focus for discussion of social issues in China? Who is Dai Qing and what is her role in conveying information between Western and Chinese media? What difficulties would you imagine encountering in reporting on the Three Gorges Dam and how do you think you would focus a story? Compare coverage in Hong Kong ( South China Morning Post ) with the official news from the People’s Republic of China (Xinhua News Agency and  People’s Daily ).  How do they differ in form and content? How is Chinese coverage different from and similar to Western coverage of issues like resettlement or the May, 1999 Zhu Ronghi speech?
