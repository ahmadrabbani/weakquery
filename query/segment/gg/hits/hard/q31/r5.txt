The report, documented by Chinese state news agency Xinhua, found that the dam’s environmental impact was limited to a 12-mile radius. Three Gorges impounds water for a 22,400-MW hydro project. The dam was designed to  control the flood-prone Yangtze River .   The report comes in response to criticism over the world’s largest hydropower dam, which grew considerably over the past year as China’s Hunan and Jiangxi provinces suffered their worst droughts in half a century.   Critics wondered if the low water levels in Dongting and Poyang lakes -- both downstream from Three Gorges on the Yangtze River -- were perhaps the most visible evidence of the dam’s negative effects, but several scientists said there was no evidence that the dam had caused the drought.   “No direct link has been found between the dam and local severe droughts and floods in recent years,” said the SSAP report.   Instead, it is believed that extreme weather conditions caused by abnormal atmospheric circulation and air temperature incurred by changes in ocean temperature and snow conditions at the Quinghai-Tibet Plateau are to blame, according to the report.             Latest Articles      Report says Three Gorges Dam not responsible for climate change   (Nov 17, 2011)   U.S. seeks outlet coatings replacement at Dickinson Dam   (Nov 17, 2011)   Senate panel endorses Alaska park land swap for small hydro project   (Nov 17, 2011)   French firm to supply EM equipment for 1-MW Cavaletade   (Nov 17, 2011)   U.S. awards rural energy funds to hydro projects in four states   (Nov 17, 2011)   Benin seeks environment, resettlement studies for 147-MW Adjarala   (Nov 17, 2011)   U.S. uses PrismTech software to upgrade controls at 6,809-MW Grand Coulee   (Nov 16, 2011)   India state, hydro companies agree to develop 1,500-MW Tipaimukh   (Nov 16, 2011)   FERC "sets record straight" on Lake of the Ozarks shoreline plan   (Nov 16, 2011)   Three firms to refurbish generating units at Swiss 4.5-MW Charmey   (Nov 16, 2011)    HydroWorld  Article Categories: Environmental    Regulation & Policy   Hydro Industry News    Tenders & Ferc Notices   Technology & Equipment    World Regions   Dams & Civil Structures    Buyer's Guide   Hydro Review Current Issue Table of Contents   Hydro Review Worldwide Current Issue Table of Contents   Hydro Industry Archives             Advertisement                      Environmental   |  Hydro Project Activity |  Technology & Equipment   |  Dams & Civil Structures  |  Regulation & Policy   |  Tenders & Notices   |  World Regions   Buyer's Guide   |  HydroReview/HRW   |  Events   |  Advertise   |  Submit an Article   |  Video Gallery   |   Subscribe  |  Contact Us   |  Site Map   About Us   |  RSS   |  PennWell   |  Privacy Policy   |  Terms & Conditions   |  PennWell Websites   |  PennWell Events   | Webmaster   Copyright © 2011: PennWell Corporation
