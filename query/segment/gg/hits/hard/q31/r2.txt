It is located in the middle section of  Xiling Gorge (one of the three gorges on Yangtze River) near Sandouping Town in  Yichang City , Hubei Province. Being the world's largest hydropower project, Three Gorges Dam Project has created many "Firsts" such as the most efficient dam in flood control, the most difficult construction work and the largest migration project in the world.   Schedule of Three Gorges Dam Project Three Gorges Dam Project is composed of the dam, the hydropower stations and the navigation facility. It measures 607 feet tall and the top is 3,319 yards wide. It has taken 17 years to finish the construction of the whole project, which started in 1992 and includes three stages. The first stage took five years from 1992 to 1997. During this period, the cofferdam construction and the excavation of a diversion channel in the first stage were finished. Meanwhile, a temporary ship lock on the left bank of the river and some preparation work was also completed. The second stage lasted six years from 1998 to 2003, when the cofferdam construction was in its second stage and was undertaken at the same time as the construction of the permanent ship lock and the navigation buildings. The power station facilities construction and the installation of machinery on the left bank were also completed. The third stage of the project began in 2003 and has been completed in 2009. During this period, the installation of all machinery, the construction of the power station and the dam on the right bank are finished. Now, a 3,861 square miles canyon-reservoir dam is presented to the world.            Controversy over Three Gorges Dam The Three Gorges Project was born with a huge controversy covering economic, technical, environment, migration, tourism and the protection fields. Great concerns have been paid regarding the benefits and problems that this century's big project would bring to the people and the environment. The adoption of the project construction resolution ended the heated debates among scientists.    Benefits from Three Gorges Project : including flood control, power generation, navigation and tourism;   Problems Caused by Three Gorges Project : including sediment problem, environmental problem, migration problem and landscape loss    Scenery Change after Three Gorges Dam Completed   Tourists at Three Gorges Dam     The landscape along the Three Gorges is like a traditional Chinese picture, and the precious cultural relics ranging from the Paleolithic Age to the modern times add a human touch to the area. It is always a hot spot on travelers' itinerary. But as the water rising, many scenery and historical sites were or will be flooded (by the change of the water level).The relevant cultural relic department and local government are doing their best to save these valuable cultural treasures. The protection methods such as removal and reproduction are adopted. Moreover, the rising water also increases the scenic area, making some impenetrable streams and scenic sights easy to reach. In a word, the Three Gorges Project has ruined much natural beauty but at the same time creates new ones. So visitors should explore more, not just to feel pity of it.    Three Gorges Dam Travel Opened in 1997, the Three Gorges Dam Scenic Area is mainly composed of Tanzi Mountain, 185 Platform, Dam Viewing Point and Memorial Garden.
