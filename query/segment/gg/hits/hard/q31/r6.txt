The Three Gorges dam is a hydroelectric project on China's Yangtze River. It represents the largest hydroelectric project in the history of the world. The dam will create a reservoir approximately 400 miles long, permanently submerge approximately 150,000 acres, including 1,500 factories, at least 160 towns and 16 archeological sites and require the resettlement of 1.3 million people. It is designed to generate over 18,000 megawatts of electricity, providing electricity to rural Chinese provinces, and to provide flood management and improved navigation for the upper Yangtze River. The project has generated controversy because of its serious impacts on the ecology and environment in the region and large-scale resettlement required to complete the project.
