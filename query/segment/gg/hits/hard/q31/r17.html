      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="style1">Critics had long  warned of the potential environmental damage that would result from such an  extensive construction project. Some say that hydroelectric power should not be considered as arenewable energy source because of the   irreversible environmental damage that result from these projects.</span></p>
        <p><span class="style1"><span class="style8"><strong>Greenhouse Gases</strong>:</span><br />
          The main  environmental benefit of the Three Gorges Dam is the reduction of carbon  emissions. However, it has been found that the dam does cause greenhouse gases  to be released into the atmosphere, just not in the form of industrial  pollution. In reservoirs, the breakdown of vegetation and organic material that  accumulates actually releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere! Therefore,  while proponents claim that hydroelectric energy is a “clean” energy source,  this is not entirely the case. </span></p>
        <p><span class="style1"><span class="style8"><strong>Water Pollution</strong>:</span><br />
          Vegetation is not the  only thing that will accumulate behind the dam. The dam has blocked  approximately ten million tons of plastic bags, bottles, animal corpses, trees,  and other detritus that would have otherwise have flowed out to sea. The Yangtze River is already one of the most polluted rivers  in the world. Because of it’s proximity to several city centers, the dumping of  industrial wast<span>Enter away message text here.</span>e and sewage has always been a serious problem. More than 265 billion gallons  of raw sewage are dumped into the Yangtze annually. In addition, the reservoir itself flooded 1,600 abandoned factories, mines, dumps, and  potential toxic waste sites. Because the dam prevents any of this material to  be washed out to see, water quality in the Yangtze has become much worse since  construction of the dam began.</span></p>
        <p><span class="style1"><br />
          This project claims to  yield social benefits: less air pollution will result in better health and a higher  standard of living. But in reality, millions of residents of the Three Gorges  Dam area rely on the Yangtze River as their only water source. In Fengdu County  alone, which lies on a tributary of the Yangtze River,  contaminated water affects the lives of 50,000 people.</span></p>
        <p class="style1 style8"><strong>Siltation:</strong></p>
        <p class="style1">Because of reduced  water speed behind the dam, an estimated 530 million tons of silt will  accumulate behind the dam. Critics claim that the spillway built into the dam,  with a discharge capacity of 116,000 cubic meters, is still not of sufficient  size to prevent siltation from occurring behind the dam.  The rising silt levels could eventually cause  sections of the Yangtze to be impassible for shipping, which will impact Chongqing, which relies on Yantze River trade for economic vitality. Silt accumulation could even block the  sluice gates that are essential to control water levels behind the dam. In the  event of heavy rainfall, rather than working to control the waters, the dam  could actually cause more flooding to occur upstream. In addition, the reduced  water speed will hinder the power generating capacity of the hydroelectric dam and contribute to accumulation of pollutants and toxins in water,  reducing fresh water availability.</p>
        <p class="style1"><span class="style8"><strong>Ecosys<span class="style1">tem Disruption</span></strong><span class="style1">:</span></span></p>
        <p class="style1">The giant  hydroelectric dam serves as a physical barrier that disrupts the river  ecosystem. In addition to water pollution, habitat fragmentation will have a detrimental  affect on all species within the Three Gorges Dam area. In an environmental impact  assessment, it was determined that there are 47 endangered species in the Three  Gorges Dam area that are supposed to be protected by law. Two of the most  popular marine animals in China,  the Chinese River Dolphin and the Chinese Sturgeon are included in the list of  species at risk. Ecosystem disruption poses not only environmental problems, but economic  problems as well. The physical barrier interferes with fish spawning, and in  combination with pollution, the dam will have a serious impact on the fishing  economy of the Yangtze River.  </p>

        <p class="style1 style8"><strong>Deforestation:</strong></p>
        <p><span class="style1">Deforestation is  another factor that refutes China’s  claim that the Three Gorges Dam is a “clean” energy source. Forests are a major  carbon sink and work to negate greenhouse gas accum</span><span class="style1">ulation in the atmosphere. However,  the process of deforestation (burning trees) actually emits carbon dioxide into  the atmosphere, and is responsible for 20% of the world’s greenhouse gas  emissions. <br />
          An immense amount of  deforestation occurred for the construction of this project, mainly to provide  farmland in the surrounding areas for those whose homes and farms were flooded  by the reservoir. Much of this land is located on the steep slopes of the  gorges, and has been determined as unsuitable land for farming. In addition, the  three gorges dam area is geographically unstable, and deforestation has increased  the risk of landslides. Because of this, residents are being forced to relocate  for a second time. </span></p>
        <p class="style1 style8"><strong>Landslides:</strong></p>
        <p><span class="style1">The most current environmental  concern with the Three Gorges Dam is the prevalence of landslides. So far there  have been 91 places where the shore has collapsed, with a total of 36 kilometers of land caved  in. Some of these landslides have triggered 50 meter-high waves on the  reservoir behind the dam. In Fengjie   County alone, officials  have designated more than 800 disaster-prone areas. The potential for  geological disaster is threatening the lives of millions of residents in the  area. Large dams increase the possibility for earthquakes because of increasing  geological pressure from rising water. Over 360 million people live within the  watershed of the Yangtze River. In the chance  of earthquake or dam collapse, millions of people who live downstream will be  endangered.</span></p>
        <p><span class="style1"><br />
          Landslides have  resulted from a culmination of factors. The Three Gorges area has been always been geologically unstable before construction on the dam began. When  relocation began, many people were moved to higher land in the valley just above  the flood line. Farmers cleared land to plant crops or orange trees, but  deforestation contributed to soil erosion and destabilized many hillsides.  Construction crews are now reinforcing the hillsides with concrete to prevent  more landslides. Some residents have received aid from the government, but most  are camping out in tents nearby for lack of money and transportation to be  relocated. Most residents are farmers and fishermen who were forced to leave their villages for  higher land and put their life savings into these new homes that were not built on  reliable land.</span></p>
