It will produce enough electricity to power a large city in China (ActewAGL). However, this project has been highly controversial. It will displace about one million people from there homes and destroy a large section of the scenic Yangtzee River.  The dam met large citizen opposition in 1989, so plans were put on hold. But now the construction of the dam is back on and it is scheduled to be completed in 2009 (Pielou, E.C.). Many groups including the    International Rivers Network   , US Environmental, and Human Rights groups urged US administrators to withhold financial support for the dam. Infact, the dam was mainly funded by the China Development Bank . A picture of the beautiful Yangtzee River can be seen below. Once the dam is completed the scenery won't be nearly as dramatic.                                                timegallery.org    Back To The Rock Water Project
