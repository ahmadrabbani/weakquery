									  <p><strong>What Is Hydrogen?</strong><br />
								      The physical and chemical properties of hydrogen are what make hydrogen an ideal candidate for an energy source because it contains a large amount of energy in its chemical bond. Hydrogen is a gaseous element that is both odorless and colorless. Hydrogen is a stable element and can coexist with the element of oxygen until an exothermic reaction occurs from an addition of energy. This exothermic reaction will form water. Today, fuel cells are used to use hydrogen as an energy source to fuel items that we use every day. Fuel cells are engines that are developed to convert hydrogen energy into electrical energy. The hydrogen molecules are used to create a reaction with oxygen molecules in order to create the production of electricity within the fuel cell.</p>
										<p><strong>Hydrogen Energy</strong> <br />
									  Hydrogen energy is much like electricity in the way that it carries energy, however hydrogen energy can be stored very easily and can be transported to wherever it is needed. This gives it a great advantage over electricity, which cannot be easily stored or transported. Hydrogen energy can also be used in areas where electricity is not a possibility, such as in water. Hydrogen is known to be the lightest element on Earth, and because of it has such a low density, hydrogen energy is much lighter than its petroleum-based counterparts.</p>
										<p>Because there is no such thing as hydrogen gas on earth, it must be extracted from other substances such as water or other natural gases. Steam reforming and water electrolysis, or water splitting, are the two most common forms of extracting hydrogen atoms from water, biomasses, and other natural gas molecules. The large majority of hydrogen extraction occurs through steam reforming. This process is the most affordable means of separating the hydrogen atoms and it is used to separate hydrogen molecules.</p>
										<p>Hydrogen can be found in just about any area of the world, making it extremely flexible and giving it another advantage over other types of gases. When we heat or cool our homes, drive our cars, or use any fuel generating product, we are generating greenhouse gases and pumping them directly into the atmosphere. However, if we took more advantage of hydrogen energy to generate the power we needed, our green house gas emissions would be significantly reduced. Additionally, oil spills of epic proportions are occurring more frequently, killing many varieties of aquatic life. Hydrogen energy does not have this consequence, as even if it were spilled, it would evaporate immediately and simply turn into water.</p>
										<p><strong>The Future Of Hydrogen</strong><br />
									  The future of hydrogen energy is very exciting and much work is being done all the time to take this extremely environmentally-friendly gas and turn it into something that can be used practically. There are currently about two thousand cars in the United States that are hydrogen-powered and it will be approximately ten years before these are commonplace. Overall however, hydrogen energy is the cleanest fuel available, making it the greenest energy source when it comes to fueling the products that we need fueling today. Further, it is a renewable energy source making it inexhaustible, and as such, a very green alternative to many of today’s fuel sources.</p>
