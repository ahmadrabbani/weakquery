<P><HR WIDTH="100%" SIZE="1" COLOR="#663333" NOSHADE><B>
The energy literate scoff at perpetual motion, free energy, and cold fusion, but
what about the hydrogen economy? Before we invest trillions of dollars, lets take
a hydrogen car out for a spin.
</B><HR WIDTH="100%" SIZE="1" COLOR="#663333" NOSHADE></P>

<P>&#160;</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#0000DD">Making it</FONT></H3>

<P>Hydrogen isnt an energy source  its an energy carrier, like a battery. You
have to make it and put energy into it, both of which take energy. Ninety-six percent
of hydrogen is made from fossil fuels, mainly for use in oil refining and hydrogenating
(partially or full) vegetable oil  the kind that gives you heart attacks [1]. In
the United States, ninety percent of hydrogen is made from natural gas, with an efficiency
of 72% [2], which means youve just lost 28% of the energy contained in the natural
gas to make hydrogen (and that doesnt count the energy it took to extract and deliver
the natural gas to the hydrogen plant).</P>

<P>Only four percent of hydrogen is made from water via electrolysis. Its done when
the hydrogen must be extremely pure. Since most electricity comes from fossil fuels
in plants that are 30% efficient, and electrolysis is 70% efficient, you end up using
four units of energy to create one unit of hydrogen energy: 70% * 30% = 20% efficiency
[3].</P>

<P>Getting hydrogen using fossil fuels as a feedstock or an energy source is a bit
perverse, since the whole point is to avoid using fossil fuels. The goal is to use
renewable energy to make hydrogen from water via electrolysis. When the wind is blowing,
current wind turbines can perform at 30-40% efficiency, producing hydrogen at an
overall 25% efficiency, or 3 units of wind energy to get 1 unit of hydrogen energy.
The best solar cells available on a large scale have an efficiency of ten percent,
or 9 units of energy to get 1 hydrogen unit of energy. If you use algae making hydrogen
as a byproduct, the efficiency is about .1%, or more than 99 units of energy to get
1 hydrogen unit of energy [4].</P>

<P>No matter how you look at it, producing hydrogen from water is an energy sink.
If you dont understand this concept, please mail me ten dollars and Ill send you
back a dollar.</P>

<P>Hydrogen can be made from biomass, but then these problems arise: 1) biomass is
very seasonal, 2) contains a lot of moisture, requiring energy to store and dry it
before gasification, 3) there are limited supplies, 4) the quantities are not large
or consistent enough for large-scale hydrogen production, 5) a huge amount of land
would be required, because even cultivated biomass in good soil has a low yield 
10 tons of biomass per 2.4 acres, 6) the soil will be degraded from erosion and loss
of fertility if stripped of biomass, 7) any energy put into the land to grow the
biomass, such as fertilizer and planting/harvesting will add to the energy costs,
8) delivery costs to the central power plant, and 9) its not suitable for pure hydrogen
production [5].</P>

<P>One of the main reasons for switching to hydrogen is to prevent global warming
caused by fossil fuels. When hydrogen is made from natural gas, nitrogen oxides are
released, which are 58 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide
[6]. Coal releases large amounts of CO2 and mercury. Oil is too powerful and useful
to waste on hydrogen  its concentrated sunshine brewed over hundreds of millions
of years. A gallon of gas represents about 196,000 pounds of fossil plants, the amount
in 40 acres of wheat [7].</P>

<P>Natural gas is too valuable to make hydrogen with. One use of natural gas is to
create fertilizer (as both feedstock and energy source). This has led to a many-fold
increase in crop production, allowing an additional 4 billion people to exist who
otherwise wouldnt be here [8, 9].</P>

<P>We also dont have enough natural gas left to make a hydrogen economy happen.
Extraction of natural gas is declining in North America [10]. It will take at least
a decade to even begin replacing natural gas with imported LNG (liquified natural
gas). Making LNG is so energy intensive that it would be economically and environmentally
insane to use natural gas as a source of hydrogen [3].</P>

<P>&#160;</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#0000DD">Putting energy into hydrogen</FONT></H3>

<P>No matter how its been made, hydrogen has no energy in it. Hydrogen is the lowest
energy dense fuel on earth [5]. At room temperature and pressure, hydrogen takes
up three thousand more times space than gasoline containing an equivalent amount
of energy [3]. To put energy into hydrogen, it must be compressed or liquefied. To
compress hydrogen to 10,000 psi is a multi-stage process that will lose an additional
15% of the energy contained in the hydrogen.</P>

<P>If you liquefy hydrogen, you will be able to get more hydrogen energy into a smaller
container, but you will lose 30-40% of the energy in the process. Handling hydrogen
requires extreme precautions because hydrogen is so cold  minus 423 F. Fueling is
typically done mechanically with a robot arm [3].</P>

<P>&#160;</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#0000DD">Storage</FONT></H3>

<P>On a vehicle youd need to have a heavy cryogenic support system if you use liquid
hydrogen. The tank is cold enough to cause plugged valves and other problems. If
you add insulation to prevent this, you will increase the weight of an already very
heavy storage tank [11].</P>

<P>Lets assume that a hydrogen car can go 55 miles per kg [5]. A tank that can hold
3 kg of compressed gas, will go 165 miles and weigh 400 kg/882 lbs [12]. Compare
that with a Honda Accord fuel tank that weighs 11 kg/25 lbs, costs $100, and holds
17 gallons of gasoline. The overall weight is 73 kg/161 lbs (8 lbs per gallon).
The driving range is 493 miles at 29 mpg.</P>

<P>According to the National Highway Safety Traffic Administration (NHTSA), Vehicle
weight reduction is probably the most powerful technique for improving fuel economy.
Each 10 percent reduction in weight improves the fuel economy of a new vehicle design
by approximately eight percent.</P>

<P>The more you compress hydrogen, the smaller the tank can be. But as you increase
the pressure, you also have to increase the thickness of the steel wall, and hence
the weight of the tank. Cost increases with pressure. At 2000 psi, its $400 per
kg. At 8000 psi, its $2100 per kg [5]. And the tank will be huge  at 5000 psi,
the tank could take up ten times the volume of a gasoline tank containing the same
energy content.</P>

<P>Fuel cells are also heavy: A metal hydride storage system that can hold 5 kg
of hydrogen, including the alloy, container, and heat exchangers, would weigh approximately
300 kg (661 lbs), which would lower the fuel efficiency of the vehicle, according
to Rosa Young, a physicist and vice president of advanced materials development at
Energy Conversion Devices in Troy, Michigan [12].</P>

<P>Fuel cells are expensive. In 2003, they cost $1 million or more. At this stage,
they have low reliability, need a much less expensive catalyst than platinum, can
clog and lose power if there are impurities in the hydrogen, dont last more than
1000 hours, have yet to achieve a driving range of more than 100 miles, and cant
compete with electric hybrids like the Toyota Prius, which is already more energy
efficient and lower in CO2 generation than projected fuel cells [3].</P>

<P>Hydrogen is the Houdini of elements. As soon as youve gotten it into a container,
it wants to get out, and since its the lightest of all gases, it takes a lot of
effort to keep it from escaping. Storage devices need a complex set of seals, gaskets,
and valves. Liquid hydrogen tanks for vehicles boil off at 3-4% per day [3, 13].</P>

<P>Hydrogen also tends to make metal brittle [14]. Embrittled metal can create leaks.
In a pipeline, it can cause cracking or fissuring, which can result in potentially
catastrophic failure [3]. Making metal strong enough to withstand hydrogen adds weight
and cost.</P>

<P>Leaks also become more likely as the pressure grows higher. It can leak from un-welded
connections, fuel lines, and non-metal seals such as gaskets, O-rings, pipe thread
compounds, and packings. A heavy-duty fuel cell engine may have thousands of seals
[15]. Hydrogen has the lowest ignition point of any fuel, 20 times less than gasoline.
So if theres a leak, it can be ignited by a cell phone, a storm miles away [16],
or the static from sliding on a car seat.</P>

<P>Leaks and the fires that might result are invisible, and because of they high
hydrogen pressure, the fire is like a cutting torch with an invisible flame. Unless
you walk into a hydrogen flame, sometimes the only way to know theres a leak is
poor performance.</P>

<P>&#160;</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#0000DD">Transport</FONT></H3>

<P>Canister trucks ($250,000 each) can carry enough fuel for 60 cars [3, 13]. These
trucks weight 40,000 kg but deliver only 400 kg of hydrogen. For a delivery distance
of 150 miles, the delivery energy used is nearly 20% of the usable energy in the
hydrogen delivered. At 300 miles 40%. The same size truck carrying gasoline delivers
10,000 gallons of fuel, enough to fill about 800 cars [3].</P>

<P>Another alternative is pipelines. The average cost of a natural gas pipeline is
one million dollars per mile, and we have 200,000 miles of natural gas pipeline,
which we cant re-use because they are composed of metal that would become brittle
and leak, as well as the incorrect diameter to maximize hydrogen throughput. If we
were to build a similar infrastructure to deliver hydrogen it would cost $200 trillion.
The major operating cost of hydrogen pipelines is compressor power and maintenance
[3]. Compressors in the pipeline keep the gas moving, using hydrogen energy to push
the gas forward. After 620 miles, 8% of the hydrogen has been used to move it through
the pipeline [17].</P>

<P>At some point along the chain of making, putting energy in, storing, and delivering
the hydrogen, youve used more energy than you get back, and this doesnt count the
energy used to make fuel cells, storage tanks, delivery systems, and vehicles [17].</P>

<P>The price of oil and natural gas will go up relentlessly due to geological depletion
and political crises in extracting countries. Since the hydrogen infrastructure will
be built using the existing oil-based infrastructure (i.e. internal combustion engine
vehicles, power plants and factories, plastics, etc), the price of hydrogen will
go up as well  it will never be cheaper than fossil fuels. As depletion continues,
factories will be driven out of business by high fuel costs [20, 21, 22] and the
parts necessary to build the extremely complex storage tanks and fuel cells might
become unavailable. In a society thats looking more and more like Terry Gilliams
Brazil, hydrogen will be too leaky and explosive to handle.</P>

<P>The laws of physics mean the hydrogen economy will always be an energy sink. Hydrogens
properties require you to spend more energy to do the following than you get out
of it later: overcome waters hydrogen-oxygen bond, to move heavy cars, to prevent
leaks and brittle metals, to transport hydrogen to the destination. It doesnt matter
if all of the problems are solved, or how much money is spent. You will use more
energy to create, store, and transport hydrogen than you will ever get out of it.</P>

<P>Any diversion of declining fossil fuels to a hydrogen economy subtracts that energy
from other possible uses, such as planting, harvesting, delivering, and cooking food,
heating homes, and other essential activities. According to Joseph Romm The energy
and environmental problems facing the nation and the world, especially global warming,
are far too serious to risk making major policy mistakes that misallocate scarce
resources [3].</P>

<P>When fusion can make cheap hydrogen, reliable long-lasting nanotube fuel cells
exist, and light-weight leak-proof carbon-fiber polymer-lined storage tanks/pipelines
can be made inexpensively, then lets consider building the hydrogen economy infrastructure.
Until then, its vaporware. All of the technical obstacles must be overcome for any
of this to happen [18]. Meanwhile, we should stop the FreedomCAR and start setting
higher CAFE standards [19].</P>
