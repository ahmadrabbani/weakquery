              <li class="body">There is no authority who decides what is a good 
                idea. We have lost the need to go to an authority to find out 
                whether an idea is true or not. We can read an authority and let 
                him suggest something; we can try it out and find out if it is 
                true or not. If it is not true, so much the worseso the authorities

                </span></span>During the past 15 years, indisputable experimental 
                evidence has built up for substantial excess heat (far beyond 
                ordinary chemical energy) and low-energy nuclear reaction phenomena 
                in specialized heavy hydrogen and ordinary hydrogen-containing 
                systems.<sup>1</sup> The primary theorists in the field that is 
                properly designated Cold Fusion/LENR have generally assumed that 
                the excess heat phenomena is commensurate with nuclear ash (such 
                as helium), whether already identified or presumed to be present 
                but not yet found. That was an excellent initial hypothesis. However, 
                the commensurate nuclear ash hypothesis has not been proved, and 
                appears to be approximately correct in only a few experiments. 
                During this same period, compelling evidence although not as 
                <i>broadly</i> verified as data from cold fusion/LENRhas also 
                emerged for other microphysical sources of energy that were previously 
                unexpected by accepted physics.  The exemplar of this has been 
                the &quot;hydrino&quot; physics work of Dr. Randell Mills and 
                his colleagues at BlackLight Power Corporation, which was a radical 
                outgrowth from the cold fusion field that emerged publicly in 
                May 1991.<sup>2</sup> Even more far-reaching is the work in vacuum 
                energy extraction pioneered by Dr. Paulo and Alexandra Correa, 
                which first became public in 1996.<sup>3</sup> This vacuum energy 
                experimentation began in the early 1980s and has been reduced 
                to prototype technological devices, such as the patented PAGD<sup>TM</sup> 
                (pulsed abnormal glow discharge) electric power generator, as 
                well as many published experiments that can be performed in table-top 
                fashion to verify the Correa Aetherometry (<i>non-luminiferous</i> 
                or <i>non-electromagnetic</i> aether measurement science).<sup>4</sup> 
                In an era when mainstream science and its media is all agog about 
                dark matter and dark energy composing the vast bulk of the 
                universe, there is a great need to reconcile, if possible, the 
                significant bodies of evidence from these three major experimental 
                and theoretical streams: cold fusion/LENR, hydrino physics, and 
                Aetherometry. The aim of the present paper is to compare the substantial 
                features of each field of investigation and to suggest how to 
                move forward for the benefit of all with openness and a minimum 
                of preconceptions.</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>On the surface, all 
                seems calmat least to the so-called Scientific Establishment, 
                in other words the mainstream scientific media. The latter includes 
                <i>prominently Science, Nature, Physical Review, Scientific American, 
                American Scientist, The New York Times</i> Science Times, and 
                a host of other publications, which alternately ignore, mock, 
                or misrepresent those scientific findings hard-won in laboratory 
                experiments, such as are represented in the better papers that 
                are presented at Cold Fusion/LENR conferences such as ICCF10. 
                And, the major peer-reviewed publications in this Establishment 
                do not accept papers on low-energy nuclear reactions and cold 
                fusion phenomenathese are not even given entrance (since the 
                1989-90 period) into the vaunted peer review process. This fact 
                is neither admitted publicly by the obstructing publications, 
                nor noted by the community of science journalists, who should 
                be among the first to investigate and expose this blatantly anti-scientific 
                publication practice.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>To the Scientific 
                Establishment all is calm because there are no phenomena from 
                table-top experiments that are allowed to challenge the basic 
                foundational physics paradigms, which have been laid down to become 
                what can only be described as a church-like holy writ. It is 
                almost as though we are back in 1894 when the sentiment expressed 
                in the above quote of Albert Michelson prevailedall is well with 
                Physical Science and further advances are to be sought chiefly 
                in the rigorous application of these principles to all the phenomena 
                which come under our notice. That is essentially the dogma of  
                mainstream physics circa 2003. Moreover, most scientists in the 
                cold fusion/LENR field, whose experimental work is rejected by 
                the mainstream, do not wish to challenge the foundations of physics 
                either; they believe that cold fusion/LENR does not challenge 
                those foundations at all and that their observations can be or 
                will be explained by prevailing quantum mechanics and relativity 
                theory.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Let us examine some 
                fundamental assumptions. What are the paradigms that we have come 
                to learn cannot be questioned, and who is saying that we cannot 
                question them? Let me summarize the sacrosanct fundamental paradigms:</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Paradigm 1:</b> 
                It is impossible to transmute elements with ease in experiments 
                performed without the presence of extremely high temperatures 
                (millions of degrees K) or large acceleration voltages. (Natural 
                radioactivity and natural or artificial fission are the only exceptions.)</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Paradigm 2:</b> 
                It is impossible to obtain significant <i>unexplained</i> excess 
                energy in experiments with an input energy: All energetic balances 
                in <i>all experiments</i> must be explained by conventionally 
                understood chemical reactions, conventionally understood nuclear 
                fission, natural radioactivity, or conventionally understood nuclear 
                fusion. If there is any other reported significant excess energy 
                in an experiment that would suggest a new, unknown source of energy, 
                these alleged experiments and claimed processes are <i>prima facie</i> 
                to be regarded as mistakes, or worse.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Paradigm 3:</b> 
                The validity of Special Relativity cannot be questioned legitimately. 
                It is such a well-checked theory that it has achieved the status 
                of Fact, not Theory. Space and time cannot exist separately. They 
                are entwined forever as space-time. (Witness this from Caltech 
                Prof. David Goodstein, who has also disparaged cold fusion: there 
                are theories in science which are so well verified by experience 
                that they become promoted to the status of <i>fact</i>. One example 
                is the Special Theory of Relativityits still called a theory 
                for historical reasons, but it is in reality a simple, engineering 
                fact from a video-taped lecture, Atoms to Quarks in <i>The 
                Mechanical Universe</i> series.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Paradigm 4:</b> 
                The validity of the fundamental structure of Quantum Mechanics 
                cannot be questioned legitimately. QM is open to many interpretationsThe 
                Copenhagen interpretation, the Multi-Worlds hypothesis, etc., 
                but QMs fundamental structure, as already revealed, is not open 
                to revision at its foundations.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Paradigm 5:</b> 
                The so-called vacuuma region of space-time, a plenum, that is 
                devoid of atoms and molecules and is seemingly emptymay be 
                pervaded by Dark Matter, Dark Energy, electromagnetic radiation 
                and quantum fluctuations, <i>i.e.</i> zero-point energy (ZPE). 
                However, no table-top experiment that has ever been performed 
                can tap this vacuum and obtain technologically useful energies. 
                Remarkably, it is now asserted in mainstream publications, <i>e.g.</i> 
                Ref. 1, that Dark Matter comprises 30% of the substance of the 
                universe and Dark Energy comprises 65% of the universe! Though 
                the nature of these two cosmic constituents is entirely unknownof 
                course, theories multiply about what they arethe Establishment 
                has the chutzpah to claim that a Theory of Everything is not 
                far away and that that theory will most likely be found in terra-electron 
                volt particle accelerators costing billions of dollarsand most 
                certainly <i>never</i> in cold fusion/LENR experiments.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Paradigm 6:</b> 
                Gravitation is to be understood by General Relativity or its derivatives<i>i.e.</i> 
                by the curvature of 4-dimensional space-time. No other fundamental 
                mode of understanding gravity can be allowed (such as pushing 
                gravity theories<sup>2</sup>), and certainly no theory of gravity 
                that would allow anti-gravity to be demonstrated easily in table-top 
                experiments. This is most ironic because Establishment physicists 
                freely admit that two major foundation paradigms to which they 
                subscribeQuantum Mechanics and General Relativityhave not yet 
                been shown to be compatible and have not been unified in an acceptable 
                manner to them.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Paradigm 7:</b> 
                The Second Law of Thermodynamics can never be violated in macroscopic 
                systems. One cannot make a Perpetual Motion Machine of the Second 
                Kind that would convert ambient thermal energy to useful work, 
                with no heat rejection into a lower-temperature reservoir.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The foregoing is a 
                highly restrictive set of dogmas within which scientists are expected 
                to conduct their work. There can be no doubt that these are the 
                intellectual walls that the Scientific Establishment has erected. 
                True enough, a huge amount has been learned about Nature within 
                the confines of these paradigm restrictions, and much technological 
                progress has occurred toobut there is so, so much more to the 
                universe and to what human beings surely will be able to do and 
                become if they could be liberated from those restrictions! There 
                are other restrictive dogmas in modern science, particularly in 
                the areas of biology and medicine, but these seven enumerated 
                paradigms are the fundamental constraints as they affect physics 
                and chemistry and the topic of ICCF10cold fusion and LENR. 
                Those reporting nuclear phenomena and excess heat phenomena at 
                this meeting are among those who challenge Paradigms 1 and 2 above, 
                and I fully accept that this CF/LENR community has demolished 
                those paradigms very effectively.<sup>3</sup></p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The community of those 
                who accept this general body of evidence, as they well know, are 
                already heretical outcasts from the Scientific Establishment. 
                Nonetheless, most in this community are very uncomfortable with 
                discussing challenges to Paradigms 3, 4, and 5. They have accepted 
                <i>de facto</i> the constraints of these three paradigms. It is 
                the object of this paper to suggest that there is substantial 
                evidence that negates those three paradigms, evidence which may 
                be essential to understanding cold fusion/LENR. I will not discuss 
                Paradigms 6 and 7, because opening the door to discrediting Paradigms 
                3, 4, and 5, is quite enough for one paper!but I will suggest 
                that these two latter paradigms, 6 and 7, are not valid either. 
                In particular as regards Paradigm 7, there has been published 
                an entire Conference Proceedings<sup>4</sup> (from the AIP no 
                less!), reviewed in <i>Infinite Energy</i>,<sup>5</sup> which 
                examines the extremely shaky foundations of Paradigm 7. This work 
                should be of great interest to those looking ahead to employing 
                excess heat from cold fusion/LENR in technological applications. 
                I respectfully disagree with ICCF10 conference chairman Professor 
                Hagelstein (and ENECO) that <i>all</i> heat engines will be forevermore 
                fundamentally Carnot-limited.</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Cold fusion began 
                with the assertion by Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons (F&amp;P) 
                that evidence for previously unknown kinds of nuclear reactions 
                and excess heat of large magnitude could be observed in certain 
                electrochemical cells with heavywater-based electrolyte.<sup>6</sup> 
                They wrote, the data on enthalpy generation would require rates 
                for reactions (v) and (vi) in the range 10<sup>11</sup>  10<sup>14</sup> 
                atoms s<sup>-1</sup>. It is evident that reactions (v) and (vi) 
                are only a small part of the overall reaction scheme and that 
                other nuclear processes must be involved.  (Reaction (v) was

                in the discussion section of their controversial paper, The most 
                surprising feature of our results however, is that the reactions 
                (v) and (vi) are only a small part of the overall reaction scheme 
                and that the bulk of the energy release is due to an hitherto 
                unknown nuclear process or processes (presumably due to clusters 
                of deuterons). Indeed, it was very reasonable for them to presume 
                that a class of nuclear reactions might ultimately explain cold 
                fusionsince some nuclear products had already been detected (tritium 
                generation and low-level neutron emission, which were later confirmed 
                in more exacting ways) and the magnitude of the excess energy 
                was far too large to be explained by conventionally understood 
                chemical reactions. </p>

                of the F&amp;P nuclear reaction hypothesis either from excess

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The first experimental 
                indication that F&amp;Ps hypothesis might be correct came in 
                early-1991, when Miles <i>et al.</i> found a correlation between 
                the excess heat from F&amp;P-type cells (or the lack of excess 
                heat thereof in cases that were null) and the presence or absence 
                of <sup>4</sup>He signature in the gas evolved from the F&amp;P 
                cells in their lab.<sup>7</sup> They reported this formally in 
                the scientific literature in 1994.<sup>8</sup> But while these 
                remarkable results were being readied for publication, several 
                new directions or offshoots had emerged from and within the CF/LENR 
                field. In the spring of 1991, Dr. Randell Mills <i>et al.</i> 
                reported significant excess heat from ordinary water cells with 
                nickel electrodes, an energy which they deemed to be coming <i>not</i> 
                from nuclear reactions, but from a new form of catalyzed shrinkage 
                reaction via a drastically remodeled form of the hydrogen atom 
                and a re-write of quantum mechanics, which is now called by Mills 
                Classical Quantum Mechanics (CQM).<sup>9,10</sup> These explanations 
                (and even the claim of excess heat in ordinary water-based electrochemical 
                cells)  did not go over well either with the CF/LENR community 
                or the hard-line Establishment critics of table-top anomalous 
                physics. CF/LENR scientists, themselves outcasts from the Establishment, 
                strangely enough have not paid much attention to Mills experimental 
                work. This is most unfortunate, because it is compendious and 
                strongly supportive of excess heat but also of non-standard, highly 
                anomalous, spectral anomalies from hydrogen systems. This stance 
                can be explained because of the very strong resistance by CF/LENR 
                theorists to exploring foundational flaws in Standard Quantum 
                Mechanics (SQM). Mills CQM work could shed considerable light 
                on the problem of CF/LENRthese are results that cannot and should 
                not be logically separated from efforts to understand CF/LENR 
                results proper.</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Randell Mills, for 
                his part, wants nothing to do with the cold fusion field, in 
                part because of the bad PR that cold fusion has acquired. But 
                Mills, while accepting that his shrunken (sub-ground state) 
                hydrogen atoms (hydrinos) may well cause nuclear reactions due 
                to their more charge- neutral presentation to other nuclei, does 
                not believe that the excess heat being reported in CF/LENR experiments 
                is of nuclear origin<i>i.e.</i> the direct result of nuclear 
                reactions with a mass-deficit of Dm, with an energy equivalent 
                output found by E=<span style='font-family:Symbol'>D</span>mc<sup>2</sup>.

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Though Mills CQM 
                theory may itself have significant flaws, it does have two characteristics 
                that recommend it: A. It seems to have very significant predictive 
                power to suggest what hydrogen systems are likely to evolve excess 
                heat, and which ones may not (more such predictive ability than 
                most CF/LENR concepts), and B. CQM is not beholden to the mainstream 
                cold fusion hypothesis (MCFH)<i>i.e.</i> at least it allows 
                the possibility that many instances of excess heat are not of 
                nuclear origin per se. In this latter Point B Mills is likely 
                closer to the truth (but possibly for the wrong reasons!) than 
                are champions of MCFH theories. One only has to examine the 100% 
                repeatable excess energy work of Peter and Neal Graneau in water 
                arc explosions and air arc phenomena (see below and Refs. 25-32) 
                to realize this. Neither the MCFH nor Mills is likely to be able 
                to explain these phenomena.</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In the early 1990s 
                there also began to be increasing reports of heavy element transmutation 
                phenomena in low-energy experiments; some of the most remarkable 
                initial results came from John OM. Bockris <i>et al.</i> at Texas 
                A&amp;M (see the Bockris story in Ref. 11). I well recall the 
                extreme resistance to accepting these heavy-element transmutation 
                claims in the period 1992-1994, expressed to me by some prominent 
                cold fusion theorists, such as the late Julian Schwinger and Talbot 
                and Scott Chubb. Today, heavy element transmutations are in general 
                very well accepted in the CF/LENR field.  Some of the most remarkable 
                and definitive results that support such transmutation phenomena 
                have been published by a group at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 
                Advanced Technology Research Center.<sup>12,13</sup> Talbot Chubb, 
                for his part, believes he can explain such transmutations via 
                an extension of his earlier theoretical framework that predicts 
                <sup>4</sup>He formation in or on metal lattices.<sup>14</sup> 
                I believe that this proposal is grasping at straws and represents 
                an <i>ad hoc</i> proposal to preserve loyalty to conventional 
                SQM. Talbot admits that his theory in which a many-body wavelike 
                deuteron system overlaps with a localized cesium-133 atom to 
                produce praesodymium may be a stretch. He writes, I know the 
                above sounds fanciful. It requires that quantum mechanics obey 
                previously unexplored rules when applied to a many-body ion system 
                bound within a multiplicity of shallow wells. These rules are 
                not tested when a many body system is bound within a single potential 
                well. Better that he should consider that SQM just cannot handle 
                this powerful form of blatant modern alchemy in which no special 
                electrical energy input or loading is evidently required. To me, 
                the Mitsubishi work strongly suggests that there is something 
                deeply wrong with our understanding of atomic and nuclear structure<i>i.e.</i>

                papers that report excess heat as well as nuclear products, one 
                stands out for showing a <i>quantitative</i> relationship between 
                excess heat and nuclear products,<i> i.e.</i> rough obedience 
                to the MCFH. This is work that was reported first in 2000 at ICCF8 
                by McKubre<i> et al.</i> at SRI International.<sup>15</sup> The 
                group performed multiple tests of Dr. Les Cases catalytic fusion 
                process, which employs heated palladium-coated carbon catalysts 
                in deuterium gas atmosphere. The replication team cross-checked 
                its results with two types of calorimetry and it published data 
                which shows the increasing evolution of <sup>4</sup>He on multiple 
                runs. Moreover, the group was able to correlate the quantity of 
                helium produced at different times during each run with the excess 
                energy produced. The regression lines for each form of calorimetry 
                gave: Q=31±13 MeV/<sup>4</sup>He atom (for the gradient calorimetry 
                method) and Q=32±13 MeV/<sup>4</sup>He atom (for the differential 
                calorimetry method). The authors were careful to state: Although 
                these Q values include that of reaction [1] within their assigned 
                uncertainties, the mean values for the <sup>4</sup>He presented 
                directly to the gas phase for analysis is only ~75% of that predicted 
                by equation [1]. Equation [1] referred to is, of course, D +

                MeV (lattice), which corresponds to the hot plasma fusion D +

                ray.  Error bars aside, it is very tempting to suggest that this 
                data is highly suggestive of a kind of net D + D fusion reaction 
                that produces <sup>4</sup>He, but we must be cautious because: 
                A. There isnt highly accurate measurement of the energy-per-atom 
                release and B. Because of the possibility that other nuclear change 
                phenomena connected with alterative fundamental physics theories 
                might eventually be found to yield the same net reaction results.</p>

                abstracts presented to ICCF10 suggests that uncertainty remains 
                about whether the helium production rate is commensurate with 
                excess energy. One of the very best investigators, Dr. Melvin 
                Miles, writes in his abstract<sup>16</sup>: Furthermore, the 
                rate of helium-4 production was always in the appropriate range 
                of 10<sup>10</sup> - 10<sup>12</sup> atoms per second per watt 
                of excess power. The yes or no helium correspondence with excess 
                heat production cannot be denied; he puts the chance that it is 
                in error at 1/750,000 a fantastic experimental accomplishment. 
                But the failure to pin down commensurate <sup>4</sup>He with excess 
                heat within less than two orders of magnitude is troubling. We 
                also have the ICCF10 abstract of A. DeNinno <i>et al.,</i> <sup>4</sup>He 
                Detection in a Cold Fusion Experiment.<sup>17</sup> The researchers 
                indeed appear to have found anomalous <sup>4</sup>He (by a factor 
                of about 20 out of baseline), but they appear not to have an 
                accurate assessment of its correlation with excess heat for they 
                can only estimate, at the present time, a lower bound for the 
                produced energy. Perhaps they will have more accurate results 
                by the time of the conference.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>One of the most paradigm-busting 
                sets of papers to be presented at ICCF10 is by Drs. R.A. Oriani 
                and J.C. Fisher.<sup>18,19</sup> Using CR-39 particle track detectors 
                immersed in Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> dissolved in heavy or 
                light water, and using Ni and Pd cathodes, they conclude: There 
                is a causal relationship between electrolysis and energetic charged 
                particles and that neither Pd nor D<sub>2</sub>O is essential 
                for the generation of a nuclear reaction. In John Fishers separate 
                theoretical paper concerning this experiment he reports, A theoretical 
                basis is offered for the remarkable observation by Oriani and 
                Fisher of a shower of about 250,000 energetic charged particles 
                that occurred in the vapor of oxygen and hydrogen evolved from 
                electrolysis.  The shower was localized in space and time, originating 
                a few millimeters above the surface of a plastic detector chip 
                and lasting for a few seconds. The responsible nuclear reactions 
                must have been sustained by the vapor. Fishers polyneutron theory, 
                which suggests that polyneutrons are omnipresent,  has this implication, 
                Fisher says: The theory suggests that a single polyneutron can 
                ignite a chain reaction that is sustained by <sup>18</sup>O as 
                fuel.  Sure, we still have the MCFH paradigm here in Fishers 
                polyneutron theory, but in this experiment we are far removed 
                from the notion of  lattice-based nuclear reactionsare we not? 
                Why not then consider even more radical theoretical medicine?</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'> The work of John 
                Dash and Dan Chicea: The apparent production (enhancement) of

                in hydrogen atmospheres or  in electrolytic production is truly 
                remarkable.<sup>20</sup> This high-Z transmutation, if it is validated, 
                shows how easy and omnipresent the transmutation phenomenon

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'> In recalling some 
                other papers from the past that may challenge the MCFH, we take 
                particular note of Otto Reifenschweillers work, which was performed 
                initially  decades before the cold fusion era.<sup>21,22</sup> 
                In this work, the investigator essentially proves that there is 
                a largeand <i>reversible</i>temperature dependency of the decay 
                rate of tritium.  The author postulates that the formation of 
                tritium doublets somehow can change the radioactive emissions 
                of tritium nuclei. To quote the tornado-flung Dorothy in <i>The 
                Wizard of Oz</i>, We are not in Kansas... To explain this kind 
                of phenomenon will require far stronger theoretical medicine than 
                has heretofore been brought to bear on CF/LENR problems.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'> Finally, I take 
                note of the increasing appearance of reported and reproduced transmutations 
                of elements in biological systems. At least one such paper is 
                in fact being given at ICCF10 by an experienced team.<sup>23</sup> 
                This work must be taken very seriously nowthe researchers at 
                ICCF10 will be presenting a technique that looks very promising 
                for reducing the radioactivity of nuclear waste. The biological 
                transmutation phenomenon has profound implications for CF/LENR 
                theorists, most all of whom have preferred to ignore it. Dr. Ed 
                Storms, to his credit, embraces it objectively. He wrote in December 
                2001 in his Cold Fusion: An Objective Assessment: Transmutation 
                is claimed to occur in living systems where the process becomes 
                especially difficult to believe or understand. Indeed, people 
                have advised me not to discuss this subject, as if the potential 
                reader would be too immature to handle the intellectual conflict 
                this discussion might cause. The research in biotransmutation 
                suggests that biological systems have discovered <i>something 
                in nature</i> which they make use of to carry out nuclear changes; 
                and using that something most definitely does <i>not</i> require 
                the loading of Pd or Ni cathodes or any metallic lattice within 
                a living system, whichapart from prosthetic devices in peopledo 
                not exist. Could it be that our basic atomic and nuclear physics 
                models are flawed at their foundations? Could it be, perhaps, 
                that those many researchersin medicine and in biology, far removed 
                from the CF/LENR fieldwho have found other kinds of anomalous 
                behavior in biological systems, are in truth observing the signal 
                of a pervasive medium that is ignored not only in medical and 
                biology texts, but in physics as well? Indeed, that seems to me 
                to be the essence of what is befuddling us allwe are ignoring 
                <i>most of the physical universe</i> in attempting to explain 
                CF/LENR with incomplete and obsolete physics. And, friends, that 
                will just not work. It may work for academic speculators about 
                dark matter and dark energy, who endlessly bend their theories 
                to conform to the latest fashion and who have no ability or intention 
                to discover world-changing technologies. But for researchers in 
                CF/LENR, ignoring what constitutes most of the universe may be 
                nothing less than suicidal.</p>

                blinded many of its scientists to other anomalous energy phenomena, 
                which appear to be far more repeatable on demand than CF/LENR 
                phenomena have been to this point. This should be a caution and 
                a warning that all may not be well with the MCFH and that broader 
                theoretical models should be considered in attempting to explain 
                CF/LENR. Not necessarily in the order of their fundamental importance, 
                the following are brief overviews of other experimental data that 
                CF/LENR researchers should examine carefully for their relevance 
                to anomalous excess energy. This list does not exclude other claimed 
                excess energy processes, but these are ones with which I am most 
                familiar and in which I have the highest confidence:</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Peter and Neal Graneau 
                and colleagues have pioneered the measurement of excess energy 
                in very simple water systems, beginning in the mid-1980s.<sup>25-30</sup> 
                However, their experimental work with excess energy had precursors 
                in work reported in 1948 by F. Frungel. By employing a capacitor 
                discharge to a confined pure water sample, the Graneaus <i>et 
                al.</i> achieved what they call a cold fog explosion of droplets, 
                which is focused like a gun by a cylindrical confining channel 
                to form an energetic jet. There is no evidence that this jet is 
                from a steam explosionhence the term cold fog which they 
                use. They attribute the explosion to electrical repulsion forces 
                among the fractionated water droplets, which are from 1 to 100 
                <span style='font-family:Symbol'>m</span>m in diameter. The slug 
                of water droplets (about one-third of the water, they say, is 
                converted to droplets of fog or mist) is so powerful that it can 
                easily penetrate 0.25-inch thick aluminum plate! In one set of 
                experiments that involved the release of 25 to 36 joules of electrical 
                energy from a capacitor into a several milliliter volume of water 
                , the investigators calculated there could have been no more than 
                a 6°C rise in temperature of the watereffectively laying the 
                steam explosion theory to rest. Graneau et al. (1996) conclude: 
                Given the fact that thermodynamic and electrodynamic forces are 
                orders of magnitude too small to bring about the arc explosions, 
                we have to conclude that the experiments prove the existence of 
                anomalous forces. Since every force in nature is backed up by 
                a store of energy, the anomalous forces require the involvement 
                of anomalous energy. They conceive of the energy source in these 
                water arc explosions as previously poorly understood release of 
                chemical energypositing that that the inter-molecular bonding 
                energy of the droplet dispersion is less than original bonding 
                energy within the liquid water. Thus, they claim that they are 
                recovering a kind of stored solar energyenergy stored in the 
                condensation of water in clouds.  They also point to theories 
                by  J.-P. Vigier  about tight Bohr orbits to try to further 
                motivate a search for the energy source. The excess energy that 
                they report is usually in the range 15% to 60%. </p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>From my perspective, 
                the stored solar energy theory of the Graneaus is a desperate 
                attempt to find a somewhat comfortable theory to explain their 
                well-established, 100% repeatable excess energy. It should be 
                noted that the experimenters certainly do not entertain any kind 
                of MCFH nuclear explanation, nor is there any reason to employ 
                such an hypothesis in this case. The essential system is electricity 
                passing through waternot hypothetical surface or volume nuclear 
                reactions on electrodes. However, apart from their dalliance with 
                Vigiers tight Bohr orbit-type of explanation (a distant relative 
                of the Randell Mills hydrino theory), the researchers avoid considering 
                whether a vacuum energy (aether energy) explanation might be possible. 
                But those who have compiled considerable<i> experimental</i> evidence 
                for a <i>massfree</i> (<i>i.e.</i> inertialess), <i>non-electromagnetic</i>

                electrodynamic anomalous cathode reaction forces in water and

                [Pulsed Abnormal Glow Discharge Reactor (see below)], and subsequently 
                on Aetherometry. We have followed the work of Peter Graneau over 
                the yearsand concur with much of Peters views on the solar origin 
                of the chemical energy that is anomalously stored in water and 
                air molecules. But whereas Peters analysis relies upon the conventional 
                transformations of a supposed solar electromagnetic radiation 
                into sensible heat and the thermal drift energy of molecular substrates, 
                and sees the source of the anomalous energy in arcs as a property 
                of covalent bonds, our aetherometric research has laid the basic 
                scientific proofs for the existence of massfree electric radiation 
                of solar origin and proposed an entirely new set of dependences 
                of the electromagnetic frame upon this electric form of aether 
                radiation. Moreover, the existence of fundamental adiabatic processesresponsible 
                for enthalpic balance in basic chemical reactions and for energy 
                transfer in noncovalent interactionsthat remain poorly understood, 
                has led our theoretical effort to propose a new functional and 
                conceptual approach to the relation between sensible heat (in 
                all of its manifestationsradiative, convective and conductive) 
                and latent heat. Neither of the Graneaus accepts, in this context, 
                that both of these processes are driven by massfree aether energyelectric 
                and nonelectricwhose understanding requires new mathematical, 
                physical, analytical and experimental tools. As Neil told us, 
                his vision is not compatible with the notion of an Aether, stationary 
                or dynamic; his approach is one tied to classical positivism, 
                and in particular to the atomistic view of the particle world 
                that remains dominant.</p>

                the Graneaus, who have such a brilliantly simple demonstration 
                of an excess energy process, studiously avoid the notion that 
                there can be any <i>massfree anything</i> in the void between 
                what are regarded as hard particle atoms. Such is the strength 
                of the dominant paradigms that the Graneaus can conceive of only

                Moreover, this air-arc work has now been published in a mainstream 
                plasma physics journal and it demonstrates an excess <i>electrical

                apparent energy anomalies. The intent of Wallman/Dammann initially

                clean-burning gas (<i>nominally</i> a mixture of H<sub>2</sub>

                severe critics of cold fusion (<i>e.g.</i> P. Zimmermann and

                Mills work, which is increasingly appearing in quality peer-reviewed 
                journals such as the <i>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy</i>. 
                As with the pathological skeptics attacks on cold fusion, the

                criticisms of the experiments (the skeptics never offer any actual

                to objective evaluators of this brief excerpt, from a much larger 
                multifaceted experimental program from BlackLight Power, that 
                something quite profound is happeningmuch as profound findings 
                are emerging, albeit of a different but related character, in 
                the CF/LENR field. It is most unfortunate that the external, intellectually 
                bankrupt terrorist-like activities of people such as Park and 
                Zimmermann has created the circumstance where open communication 
                between the CF/LENR field and the sister area of hydrino science 
                is extremely difficult. But not to assign all blame to Park and 
                Zimmerman: there has been a calculated avoidance of Mills by theorists 
                within CF/LENR. Why? Again, because of excessive and misplaced 
                fidelity to the SQM theory. A curative for this common CF/LENR 
                malady might be a careful reading Mills recent paper, The Fallacy

                in excess energy from arc discharges, which began serendipitously 
                for them in the early 1980s, further expands the universe of what 
                is possible in systems with electrical input into plasmas. It 
                took the Correas many long years to control the explosive releases 
                of energy that destroyed many reactors and power supplies, but 
                now they have the process firmly under control. The Correa PAGD 
                work really puts the nonsense of controlled thermonuclear fusion 
                work into perspective, as CF/LENR has not yet been able to do. 
                Here we have self-financed researchers with a small lab in Canada 
                already producing huge excess power, already in the form of continuous 
                output <i>electricity</i>of which the hot fusioneers can only 
                dream, even after having spent circa $20 billion on their white 
                elephant projects.  The Correas are using technologies that are 
                explicitly detailed so far in three U.S. patents covering their 
                PAGD technology.<sup>38</sup> They use large glass high-vacuum 
                tubes with aluminum plate cathodes to demonstrate that in a particular 
                negative resistance region of arc discharge, they can create automatic 
                (autogenous) pulses of electrical energy that far exceed input 
                energy. For example, one integrated V-I plot of an output pulse 
                may amount to 42 J of energy in 150 msec, triggered by a 25 msec 
                pulse from the drive pack of  only 4.4 J.</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Moreover, the Correas 
                show explicitly in their patents how such excess electricity can 
                charge up deep cycle batteries. They have arranged their experiments 
                such that by moving the ~500 V driving battery pack, when it is 
                depleted, to the position of the charging-up (output) pack and 
                moving the charging-up pack to the drive position, they can sustain 
                indefinite electric energy production. They have gone much further: 
                In experiments that this author and others have witnessed in the 
                past few years, they have been able to drive certain flywheel 
                spinner motors at 500 W spin-up power with only 50 W DC input 
                power. (These new developments in motor driving are not yet patent-protected.)</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I first had the opportunity 
                to meet Dr. Paulo Correa at the Third International Symposium 
                on New Energy, held in Denver, CO in April 1996. There he spoke 
                about his and his co-investigator Alexandra Correas PAGD<sup>TM</sup> 
                reactor. Alexandra was not able to attend that meeting, but Dr. 
                Correa gave an excellent keynote lecture at that time about the 
                PAGD. Dr. Correas scientific demeanor and explanations were then 
                already impressive. He copiously referenced the work of many others 
                who had earlier found anomalies in arc behavior, and he offered 
                specific praise for Dr. Harold Aspdens work, which I had earlier 
                encountered. (Dr. Aspden is on <i>Infinite Energy's</i> Scientific 
                Advisory Board and is a long-time scientific colleague of the 
                Correas. His website is: http://www.energyscience.co.uk.) At the 
                1996 Denver meeting, Dr. Aspden spoke on Vacuum Spin as a New 
                Energy Sourceand this may indeed be part of the explanation 
                for what is going on in PAGD. Dr. Aspden, with his theoretical 
                background in electrical engineering and the experience of his 
                20 years as IBMs head of patent operations in Europe, had earlier 
                offered formal assessments of the Correa PAGD worksee the recently 
                posted 1996 Opinion at the Correa website www.aetherometry.com.  
                <i>Infinite Energy</i> began publishing the work of the Correas 
                on the PAGD soon after this Denver meeting;39-43 and we also have 
                continued to publish some of Dr. Aspden's pioneering work.<sup>44-51</sup>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The PAGD work and 
                technology originated from studies of low voltage X-ray production 
                in the mid-1980s, but the Correas joint interest in the work 
                of Wilhelm Reich and Nikola Tesla was of even earlier vintage. 
                Those who would like to know about the Correas' recent work on 
                a host of  other aetherometric inventions, should read the testimonial 
                letters posted by me, Mr. Uri Soudak (formerly CTO of Israel Aircraft 
                Industries), and Prof. Arthur Axelrad of the University of Toronto. 
                The letters by me in 2001 and 2002 on observations of PAGD and 
                other devices are detailed and self-explanatory. Many of these 
                devices, including the PAGD, can be seen on a scientific DVD available 
                from (www.aethera.org). [Note: The DVD will be shown informally 
                at ICCF10 at the poster session for this paper.]</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>For now, let us consider 
                the PAGD alone as another example of an electrically-stimulated 
                excess energy process. The primary advantage of this focus is 
                that the technology has been patented and is specified precisely 
                enough in these public domain documents so that others could verify 
                it independently, if they chose to do so. Certainly, any number 
                of plasma physics labs in the hot fusion program would have little 
                difficulty in observing PAGD effectsbut judging by their behavior 
                in the cold fusion war, one can understand why these money-sucking, 
                pointless appendages of DoE  have no interest in doing so. Perhaps 
                some of the U.S. Navy labs might develop some interest, since 
                they have already carried out a very good effort in the CF/LENR 
                area on a very limited budget.</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>At the conclusion 
                of ICCF9 in Beijing in 2002, Dr. Mike McKubre in his inimitable 
                style delivered a most wonderful set of remarks.<sup>52</sup> 
                He admitted his slowness in changing his own paradigm within the 
                CF/LENR field, but then he went onin a remarkably forward-looking 
                statementto suggest that it was time for him to change. His words 
                serve as a kind of description of how the overall field of cold 
                fusion has changed and in what directions it must continue to 
                change: And in general I have resisted the expansion of the field. 
                I resisted the extension of the field into biological nuclear 
                effects, into consideration of the sort of rotating magnetic machines 
                that Gene Malloves magazine keeps us informed about, and into 
                the concept of zero point energy. I just resist the idea of 
                zero point energy. Nickel/hydrogen studiesthe possibility of 
                heat from nickel light water experimentsI have resisted this. 
                And I have resisted the concept of transmutation. That somehow 
                we can change higher mass elements from one isotope to another. 
                It isnt that I think these effects are not well observed or disclosed 
                by able people. My resistance really isI resented the diversion 
                of focus of attention from what was already a very difficult problem. 
                In general those effects are just too easy for our critics to 
                attack  to use as sticks to beat us with. At least for the heat 
                effect, possibly also tritium production from nickel/light water 
                experiments with small additions of deuterium, and for the  yielded 
                evidence of nuclear isotopesat least for those two things and 
                at least for me, I think the time has come to change. My prejudice 
                must changeWe will have common theory to describe these effects.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Indeed, that should 
                be the quest for theorists within the cold fusion/LENR field, 
                a common theory to describe these effects. But what if something 
                very, very important has been left out? In an additional prescient 
                remark made at ICCF9 in that same talk, Mike McKubre said, The 
                thing that has really emerged here is what I have called, and 
                what Dr. Iwamura has called, the third elementthe important involvement 
                of an element other than palladium and deuterium. In this remark, 
                he was referring of course to the host of other elementssuch 
                as boron, or in the case of the Iwamura et al work<sup>12-13</sup> 
                the elements cesium and strontiumwhich have been used in conjunction 
                with palladium-based cold fusion experiments. But in more liberal 
                interpretation of his remark (which he most certainly did not 
                intend!) the third element that has hitherto been ignored may 
                be the energetic aether (EA), that element which experiments 
                are showing pervades the supposed vacuum of nothingness within 
                and between atoms, and which in fact most probably gives rise 
                to their very structure as extended toroidal or other geometric 
                assemblages of flux. This would be the logical continuation of 
                models sought by the great aether theorists of the 19th century, 
                among them Lord Kelvin. </p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Please examine the 
                varied opinions about the aether/ether, which I have collected 
                in a lengthy Appendix to this paper. It will give you a modest 
                historic perspective that is absent in the post-Einstein literature. 
                Just as it is relatively simple for CF/LENR workers today to see 
                though the B.S. that is produced by the mainstream with their 
                references to cold fusion as pathological science, so is it 
                remarkable to observe the memory hole effect of establishment 
                figures operating on the important matter of the energetic aether.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Yes, at root the paradigm 
                problem with cold fusion/LENR is that it is still stuck in the 
                morass that mid-to-late 20th Century physics has given ushard, 
                <i>fixed</i> elementary particles (such as electrons and quarks), 
                which are further described by a mathematized house of cards known 
                as probabilistic quantum mechanics or any of its variantsthe 
                alphabet soup QED, QFT, QCD, and now onto theories about strings, 
                branes, dark matter, dark energy, and all manner of other 
                epicycle-like junk. Indeed the hands-on experimentally measurable 
                energetic aether (EA) must now return with a vengeance to replace 
                the older concept of  mid-19th Century to early 20th Century physics, 
                the static, luminiferous (electromagnetic) aetherthe supposed 
                massfree medium that was transversely vibrated to give rise to 
                what was called electromagnetic radiation.  </p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Einsteins Special 
                Relativity (1905) was supposed to be a theory that abolished 
                any consideration of <i>this</i> aether<i>any</i> aether. In 
                truth, it abolished nothing whatsoeverat least it did not do 
                so legitimately. SR became merely a seemingly extremely well-fitting 
                body of equations that most surely does fit numerous experiments 
                and some energetic reactions. It is the illegitimate interpretation 
                of these limited equations, which suggests a complete equivalence 
                between mass and energywith no possibility of any massfree (inertialess) 
                source of energy in space. After all, we are given the famous 
                equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>, which on its face mandates that if 
                there is no mass, m, E=0. And that is again the crux of the problem 
                with the mainstream cold fusion hypothesis (MCFH).</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>There is an even greater 
                lesson here that theorists within the cold fusion/LENR field should 
                understand, that is if they want to seek the truth about nature, 
                as opposed to merely writing ever more elaborate theory papers 
                with SQM and SR as implied pillars. The philosophical belief in 
                the so-called Unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in describing 
                physical reality<sup>53</sup> has proved to be a great hazardone 
                of the worst imaginable for scientists. Cold fusion people are 
                in some sense already aware of this, but they have not gone all 
                the way in ridding themselves of this prejudice. They are aware 
                that in the early days of cold fusionand continuingEstablishment 
                theorists such as Steve Koonin were fond of proving that QM 
                would not allow the possibility of D + D cold fusion. But the 
                cold fusion theorists, rightly having more respect for the experiments 
                coming from the lab, accepted the results provisionally (and later 
                whole-heartedly) and began to try to cobble together theories 
                that could hang together and encompass all the cold fusion evidence. 
                In the beginning that evidence was not very broad and not very 
                deep, but it is today. It is time to take stock of new possibilities.</p>

                to CF/LENR? We have seen that the work of the Graneaus <i>et al.,</i> 
                Wallman and Dammann, and Mills <i>et al.</i> at BlackLight Power 
                are revealing phenomena that can be ignored by CF/LENR researchers 
                only at their peril. Then we have glimpsed the Correa PAGD work 
                and can readily see that it is among the most promising directions 
                of all the electrically-stimulated excess energy processes. Apart 
                from Mills CQM, which will either rise or fall on the correspondence 
                of its spectral predictions to Mills hydrino models, the only 
                other comprehensive physics theory that is beginning to enter 
                the public arena is the body of work being developed by the Correas 
                and their colleagues. (There is now an internet discussion group 
                that has begun to form, for which application is necessary):</p>

                fully published AToS theory (Aetherometric Theory of Synchronicity) 
                will undoubtedly have many direct predictions about what may really 
                be going on in CF/LENR, but for now it is important to examine 
                some of the already published experimentally-based work for what 
                it shows about a pervading energetic <i>non-electromagnetic</i> 
                aether. Given that this pervading aether would not only fill 
                the spaces between and within atoms, but also form the flowing, 
                dynamic structure of leptonic and nuclear particles, it is to 
                be expected that such a theory would have much to say about non-standard 
                energies in chemical bonding, as well as unconventional nuclear 
                reaction phenomena. These may all be involved in CF/LENR. </p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>It is obvious from 
                the foregoing that my view is that we should adopt this position: 
                More progress will occur in CF/LENR if it is understood by researchers 
                that the field cant remain contained within its usually defined 
                borders. The discovery of fission in the late 1930s offers a useful 
                analogy: Nuclear fission was serendipitously discovered during 
                an attempt to make transuranic elements via neutron bombardment 
                of natural uranium. The investigators did not realize initially 
                that it was fission fragments, not transuranic elements, that 
                were being observed. When they realized that nuclear fission was 
                occurring with neutron production as well, the path to a new chain-reaction 
                energy source opened. The discovery of fission contains a stark 
                warning to the cold fusion field today, which I had no way of 
                realizing when I wrote the following passages <i>in Fire from 
                Ice: Searching for the Truth Behind the Cold Fusion Furor</i>

margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>Physicist Emilio Segre, 
                who died at age 84 less than one month after the March 1989 announcement 
                in Utah, the previous December had recounted the discovery of 
                nuclear fissionon its 50th anniversarybefore a meeting of the 
                American Physical Society. (Emilio Segre, The Discovery of Nuclear 
                Fission,&quot; <i>Physics Today</i>, July 1989: 38-43.) Segre 
                had worked with Enrico Fermi in Rome in 1934 on experiments that 
                bombarded uranium with neutrons to attempt to produce what they 
                thought would be the first artificial element beyond uranium, 
                element 93one that by prediction would be similar chemically 
                to rhenium. But this strong expectation of a result prevented 
                the discovery of fission for five years before Hahn and Strassman 
                in Germany ultimately recognized it. They too would make the same 
                mistake by expecting what the Fermi group had likewise anticipated. 
                Segre also recalled other lost opportunities: how another scientist 
                had suggested the possibility of fission happening in their work, 
                but whose writing was ignored; and Swiss researchers who may have 
                seen the fission fragment evidence but who instead thought something 
                was wrong with their detector. But the biggest problem was the 
                expectation of seeing an element heavier than uranium, and not 
                paying attention to the possibility of lower mass atoms that turned 
                out to be the telltale fission fragments.</p>

margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>Segre said of writings 
                by Hahn and Meitner on the road to the discovery of fission, Their 
                early papers are a mixture of error and truth as complicated as 
                the mixture of fission products resulting from the bombardments. 
                Such confusion was to remain for a long time a characteristic 
                of much of the work on uranium. Segre recalled, My own feeling 
                at the time was that there was a mystery in uranium. In a remarkable 
                statement printed in the historic December 22, 1938, paper in 
                <i>Naturwissenschaften</i> announcing the fission discovery, Hahn 
                and Strassman wrote, As nuclear chemists working very close 
                to the field of physics, we cannot yet bring ourselves to such 
                a drastic step, which goes against all previous experiences in 
                nuclear physics. When the great physicist Niels Bohr heard of 
                the new insights on fission, he was reported to have exclaimed, 
                Oh what idiots we have all been! Oh but this is wonderful! This 
                is just as it must be! As Segre concluded in his talk, Above 
                all, it seems to me that the human mind sees only what it expects. 
                Scientists who go far afield to explore puzzles and anomalies 
                often bump into obstacles, but every once in a while they run 
                into a remarkable phenomenon waiting to be discovered. It was 
                just so with fission; might it be true also with cold fusion?</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The badly mis-named 
                cold fusion began its life by attempting to prove the Main Stream 
                Cold Fusion Hypothesis (MCFH), but in my view the field can lead 
                nowhere else but to a realization of profound mistakes that have 
                been made in 20th century physicsand other mistakes that date 
                back to the 19th century. Though the efforts to explain cold fusion/LENR 
                with prevailing paradigms has been a noble and useful quest, my 
                firm expectation is that these will fail to describe the big picture 
                adequatelythe full range of CF/LENR phenomena, not to forget 
                the other phenomena that mainstream physics has <i>no hope</i> 
                of ever  explaining. The consequences will be that relativity 
                theory and standard quantum mechanics will not survive. There 
                will be an increasing awareness of the need for larger <i>covering 
                theories</i> to replace these defective paradigms, whichto be 
                sure<i>seem</i> to be correct theories, in that in many/most 
                cases they give correct <i>quantitative</i> predictions. But is 
                in the nature of the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics 
                that theories, like Special Relativity, which are deemed by the 
                David Goodsteins of this world to be <i>facts</i>, eventually 
                fall as the truth of their fallibility becomes all too evident. 
                The <i>experimental data</i> that these theories supposedly explained, 
                will come under a much larger umbrella. There are and will be 
                different explanations for the data. That is happening right now. 
                Above all, the concept of an energetic aether will almost certainly 
                have to play a central role in explaining how CF/LENR phenomena 
                occur. I recommend to you a series of articles and special issues 
                that <i>Infinite Energy</i> has published, if you have not already 
                examined these.<sup>54-60</sup></p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Perhaps I am being 
                too idealistic or optimistic about this, but I would hope that 
                those who have pioneered in the CF/LENR field would re-consider 
                their positions. Lets get back to fundamentals. If there are 
                other measurements outside the mainstream CF line (a word our 
                late friend Juliano Preparata was fond of using), let us by all 
                means <i>step out of line</i>! We should be paying attention to 
                the work of the Graneaus, BlackLight Power, and the Correas, and 
                other challenging work that comes along. In fact, in the very 
                next issue of <i>Infinite Energy</i> (issue #51, out in late September 
                2003), we will be publishing a comprehensive report on the astonishing 
                history and science behind another physics miracle that was 
                inappropriately brushed aside by Richard Feynman, and which has 
                been relatively dormant for decades. This is the noble gas engine 
                of Hungarian inventor  Joseph Papp. Experimental work going on 
                today on this engine technology (reproduction of energetic <i>detonations</i> 
                in noble gases!) and the record of the past shows that our paradigms 
                will be forced to stretch much further than mainstream cold fusion 
                people have been willing to do.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The bridge to an understanding 
                of CF/LENR phenomena can only be a return to where physics was 
                in 1894 when Michelson uttered his famous remark about the unlikely 
                major expansion of Physical Science. Back then we were just beginning 
                to observe and understand transmutation and the aether. Atomic 
                theory was in its infancy. Many good ideas were abandoned for 
                not so good ideas. The discoveries of Cold Fusion/LENR may help 
                to bring us back to where such research directions were so unfortunately 
                interrupted.  It has brought me back already, and I hope that 
                others will follow at their own speed.</p>

                which fills space between the two bodies, and it is by the action 
                of contiguous parts of this medium that the energy is passed on, 
                from one portion to the next, till it re4aches the illuminated

                medium is therefore, during the passage of light through it, a

                Huygens, Fresnel, Young, Green, &amp;c., this energy is supposed 
                to be partly potential and partly kinetic.  The potential energy 
                is supposed to be due to the distortion of the elementary portions 
                of the medium. We must therefore regard the medium as elastic. 
                The kinetic energy is supposed to be due to the vibratory motion 
                of the medium. We must therefore regard the medium as having a 
                finite density our theory agrees with the undulatory theory in 
                assuming the existence of a medium which is capable of becoming

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The hypothesis of 
                an aether has been maintained by different speculators for very 
                different reasons. To those who maintained the existence of a 
                plenum as a philosophical principle, natures abhorrence of a 
                vacuum was a sufficient reason for imagining an all-surrounding 
                aether, even though every other argument should be against it. 
                To Descartes, who made extension the sole essential property of 
                matter, and matter a necessary condition of extension, the bare 
                existence of bodies apparently at a distance was a proof of a 
                continuous medium between them. But besides these high metaphysical 
                necessities for a medium, there were more mundane uses to be fulfilled 
                by aethers. Aethers were invented for the planets to swim in, 
                to constitute electric atmospheres and magnetic effluvia, to convey 
                sensations from one part of our bodies to another, and so on, 
                till all space had been filled three or four times over with aethers. 
                It is only when we remember the extensive and mischievous influence 
                on science which hypotheses about aethers used formerly to exercise, 
                that we can appreciate the horror of aethers which sober-minded 
                men had during the 18th century, and which probably as a sort 
                of hereditary prejudice, descended even to John Stuart Mill. The 
                disciples of Newton maintained that in the fact of the mutual 
                gravitation of heavenly bodies, according to Newtons law, they 
                had a complete and quantitative account of their motions; and 
                they endeavored to follow out the path which Newton had opened 
                up by investigating and measuring the attractions and repulsions 
                of electrified and magnetic bodies, and the cohesive forces in 
                the interior of bodies, without attempting to account for these 
                forces. Newton himself, however,  endeavoured to account for gravitation 
                by differences of pressure in an aether; but he did not publish 
                his theory, because he was not able from experiment and observation 
                to give a satisfactory account of this medium, and the manner 
                of its operation in producing the chief phenomena of nature. 
                On the other hand, those who imagined aethers in order to explain 
                phenomena could not specify the nature of the motion of these 
                media, and could not prove that the media, as imagined by them, 
                would produce the effects they were meant to explain. The only 
                aether which has survived is that which was invented by Huygens 
                to explain the propagation of light. The same evidence for the 
                existence of the luminiferous aether has accumulated as additional 
                phenomena of light and other radiations have been discovered; 
                and the properties of this medium, as deduced from the phenomena 
                of light, have been found to be precisely those required to explain

                a medium, called the ether, in which the waves can travel.  This 
                medium cannot be like any of the ordinary forms of matter; for 
                if any of these forms existed in interplanetary space, the planets

                which astronomers have been making accurate observations of the 
                motions of heavenly bodies no such retardation has ever been observed. 
                The medium which transmits light waves must therefore have a density

                I felt that any new issue should describe the origins of relativity 
                and quantum-theory, and their development since 1900.  My opportunities

                project again; it will occupy three volumes, of which this, the 
                first, deals with classical theories. The volume of 1910 has been

                a result of the failure of attempts to observe the earths motion 
                relative to the aether, and the acceptance of the principle that 
                such attempts must always fail, the word aether fell out of 
                favour, and it became customary to refer to the interplanetary 
                spaces as vacuous; the vacuum being conceived as mere emptiness, 
                having no properties except that of propagating electromagnetic 
                waves. But with the development of quantum electrodynamics, the 
                vacuum has come to be regarded as the seat of the zero point 
                oscillations of the electromagnetic field, of the zero point 
                fluctuations of electric charge and current, and of a polarisation

                the 20th  century in factthe two theories were taken to be mutually 
                exclusive; it seemed obvious that acceptance of the one must imply 
                rejection of the other.  From the vantage point of today, we see 
                that both photon and wave aspects of the behavior of light must 
                be accepted that the facts cannot all be forced into the mold 
                of one or the other of the two theories.  We have learned also 
                (thanks largely to Einstein) that we should focus on the bare 
                facts of observation, and should not, through our adherence to 
                a particular theory, read more into them than is there.  To be 
                specific, the wave properties of light are undeniable diffraction, 
                interference, polarization, etc.  But the waves of ordinary experience 
                require a medium. What more natural, therefore, than to build 
                up a detailed specification of the medium that carries light, 
                and then to seek to detect it?  Yet it was a quest that led only 
                to frustration. Einstein showed that the search for the mediumthe 
                luminiferous ether was sterile and unnecessary. The ether was 
                a red herringsomething that diverted physicists into following 
                a false scent.  Perhaps in this present discussion we should not 
                introduce the ether at all,  knowing that we are going to bury 
                it again in the end. Yet one cannot fully appreciate the emergence 
                of special relativity without some feeling for the importance 
                and the appearance of reality that the ether once enjoyed.  In

                its a deep dilemma, and the resolution of it will not be trivial; 
                it will require a substantial change in the way we look at things.  
                But I would say that the cheapest resolution is something like 
                going back to relativity as it was before Einstein, when people 
                like Lorentz and Poincaré thought that there was an aether  a

                motion through the aether. Now, in that way you can imagine that 
                there is a preferred frame of reference, and in this preferred 
                frame of reference things do go faster than light. But then in

                of the word 'ether' to be found in Chambers dictionary, 1998. 
                A 1934 Edition of the Concise Oxford Dictionary defines the ether 
                as the subtle elastic fluid permeating space and filling the 
                interstices between particles of air and other matter, a medium 
                through which light-waves are propagated. In these web pages 
                I use the spelling aether to distinguish it from the chemical 
                (anaesthetic) meaning of the word 'ether'.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>These dictionary meanings 
                are ambiguous. The aether is best defined as that which fills 
                space devoid of matter. If you say there is nothing in that 
                space, meaning that space itself is nothingness, then space, 
                which the dictionary defines as a continuous extension viewed 
                with or without reference to the existence of objects in it, 
                is something you view when there is nothing there to see. With 
                its other meaning you are viewing something that is not there 
                by looking at what is there. Nothingness means non-existent. 
                The word aether has to mean something and the physicist should 
                accept it as meaning that which fills space devoid of matter, 
                even though he or she may try then to prove that what does fill 
                that space is so subtle as to be ignored for all practical purposes.</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>There are then three 
                scientific perspectives that one can consider. Firstly, it can 
                be declared by way of assumption that the aether has a specific 
                property of determining the constant speed of light relative to 
                an absolute universal frame of reference. Alternatively, one can 
                say that the aether is a subtle elastic fluid permeating space, 
                a medium so subtle that it can adapt to ensure that the finite 
                speed of light as measured in the presence of matter takes its 
                reference on a frame determined by the matter present. The third 
                perspective is to say that the aether is that which fills space 
                devoid of matter, that being a sea of energy, the deployment 
                and reorganization of which accounts for the creation of matter 
                and then go on to supplement that with the second definition.</p>

                underworld I have chosen to call the aether. Well, Maxwell himself

                a temperature? Well, if you are a conformist and believe Einstein 
                then you must say that, since the aether does not exist in any 
                tangible form, and has been replaced by the mathematics of space-time, 
                it cannot have a temperature any more than a mathematical equation

                mass can gravitate and, furthermore, that there is a sea of energy 
                filling space, then you will conclude that if I am right the aether 
                is subject to gravitational forces. You may conclude that I have 
                to be wrong as I have gone far beyond the notion that the aether 
                has a temperature. Indeed, what value could that temperature be?</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I ask now if you have 
                heard of the cosmic background temperature, a quantity measured 
                in the locality of Earth as being 2.7 K? Orthodox scientists cannot 
                explain that other than by declaring it to be the heat residue 
                of the Big Bang, implying that it is the temperature of whatever 
                residue of matter there is out there in so-called empty space.</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I say that that temperature 
                is the temperature of the aether. It is determined by the gravitational

                shares with matter dispersed in space.</p>

                the details of this subject in the specialist PHYSICS section 
                of these web pages. So, for the immediate purpose I will just 
                say that, though the aether has a mass density, that density is 
                kept uniform, but we can still say that there is what is called 
                a gravitational potential acting between aether and material 
                bodies such as the sun. This potential implies that energy has 
                been released, as energy of motion, typically heat. The reason 
                is that gravitational potential is negative as it implies release 
                of energy by the coming together of two masses.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Suppose I say that 
                the aether owes its gravitational mass to the presence of a system 
                of aether particles each having a specific mass, then the gravitational 
                potential as between the sun and one such particle will be a measure 
                of the heat shed to the particle and retained by the particle, 
                inasmuch as the aether itself does not radiate energy from itself. 
                It follows that I can then be guided by the way heat energy is 
                shared by particles in a gas or in solid matter. There is a constant 
                in physics known as Boltzmanns constant. It connects the particle's 
                heat energy and temperature and so, if say that the energy shed 
                by the gravitational potential of the aether is retained by it 
                as heat, using that 2.7 K temperature we measure as the cosmic 
                background temperature, I can work out the mass of each such aether 
                particle.</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I have done such calculations. 
                Indeed, I derived the mass of the aether particle in the 1950s 
                and reported it in a book I published in 1960. The book, or rather 
                booklet as it was only 48 printed pages, was entitled The Theory 
                of Gravitation. It was some 30 years later that I did those aether 
                temperature calculations using the theoretical aether particle 
                mass I had derived in that 1960 publication and I obtained a temperature 
                that did, indeed, confirm the value measured as the temperature 
                of the cosmic background. See [1993d]. There was no Big Bang argument 
                in my theory!</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>CONCERNING MAXWELL'S 
                THEORY</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I must now just mention 
                one feature of the aether, one overlooked by Clerk Maxwell and 
                all those who did pursue their 19th century models of aether. 
                The aether conveys electromagnetic waves. Those waves have a lateral 
                oscillation, meaning that they wriggle sideways in their forward 
                progress as does a snake. To sustain such waves the aether had 
                to behave as if it were a solid and yet we move through it as 
                if it were a fluid devoid of mass. The 1934 dictionary said it 
                was a subtle elastic fluid. That was before the 1998 dictionary 
                got around to saying it was nothing other than something formerly 
                believed to fill all space. Well, how can the aether be fluid 
                and solid at the same time and sustain the passage those lateral 
                electromagnetic oscillations?</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The answer is that 
                it has the form of a fluid crystal and, further, that those lateral 
                waves need something other than the structure of the fluid crystal 
                to provide a lateral dynamic balance. In a fluid crystal the local 
                presence of electric fields can cause the fluid to develop its 
                crystal form in the locality of those fields. A material system 
                such as body Earth which comprises, at its ultra microscopic atomic 
                level, electric charges and their attendant fields can move through 
                the aetherial fluid crystal and carry a kind of aether crystal 
                with it, whilst surrounding aether has its own separate crystal 
                form. The structure can dissolve at the forward boundaries, dispersing 
                into the background fluid, only to reappear as new crystal structures 
                forms behind the aether structure that is dragged along by body 
                Earth.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Why, one may well 
                wonder, has the fluid crystal not been adopted by aether theorists 
                as their model for the aether? Am I really alone in seeing this 
                as the answer? What is wrong with physics if it cannot see the 
                good sense of at least examining the possibilities opened up by 
                the knowledge that there are liquid crystal displays in our pocket 
                calculators. If you read the 19th century history of ideas concerning 
                the aether, as being something impossible, both a fluid and a 
                solid, and you have such a calculator before you, then you have 
                under your control something that can exhibit the properties of 
                both a liquid or a solid. You cannot then say there is no aether 
                because there is a unresolved conflict as between its liquid and 
                solid properties. You might as well say that the liquid crystal 
                display of your calculator is an illusion, rather than a technological 
                reality.</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Just understand that 
                the aether has properties akin to those of a fluid crystal! Or 
                are you so sure that Einstein is right in turning away from the 
                aether notion, that you accept his viewpoint, rather than respecting 
                the memory of so many great 19th century physicists by reviewing 
                their efforts constructively and taken account of todays knowledge 
                of the fluid crystal?</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Let us get back to 
                the question of that lateral vibration of propagating electromagnetic 
                waves. Believe it or not, there is a kind of unseen snake wriggling 
                along side-by-side with the wave we eventually sense. It is an 
                electrical component of the aether, a dual displacement feature, 
                and it not only keeps the aether in balance dynamically, but it 
                preserves the continuity of the wave oscillations when minor impediments 
                are encountered in its transit through space. Those impediments, 
                however, take their toll on energy and, as my theoretical analysis 
                shows, the effect is that the wave energy can be depleted in transit 
                and with that the frequency. This accounts for what cosmologists 
                call the redshift and interpret as the mutual recession of all 
                stars in the universe, the phenomenon they say is the expansion 
                of the universe.</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I can derive from 
                this argument and pure theory based on detailed analysis of aether 
                structure, the observed value of what is termed the Hubble constant 
                and that is why I am certain about what I have just said. It is

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>At this point, however, 
                since these are just words, I think I should share with you a 
                picture of what the aether looks like, if you really could see 
                it. My insight into that and its portrayal will emerge when you 
                press the link to the NEXT PAGE. I certainly do not regard the 
                aether as nothingness and my task ahead is to educate you, the 
                reader, on the aether topic, whilst applying my heresy also to 
                more important topics, such as how we can extract energy from 
                that aether as well as from new kinds of heat engine that tap 
                ambient source of low grade heat. First, however, I must try to 
                guide you along the channels of thought that led me to my aether 
                belief. Foremost in this quest is the need to understand something 
                your textbooks cannot begin to address, which is how energy fed 
                into a solenoid, a wound coil of wire, can store energy in that 
                nothingness I call aether and then allow us to recover that 
                energy when we switch the current off. Yes, your physics textbooks 
                will tell you about Faradays discovery of induction and about 
                magnetic fields and lines of force, but though they tell you how 
                to calculate the energy stored in unit volume of space, they will 
                not tell you how a magnetic field actually stores that energy 
                and holds it ready for our recovery. To be sure, no textbook can 
                ever explain that without coming to terms with the reality of 
                the aether.   (Harold Aspden, September 10, 1998)</p>

                electric and thermal, whether sensible thermal or latent thermal. 
                The fine structure of these distinct aether energy forms has been 
                entirely decoded by AToS, as well as the structures they acquire

                relationship between negative gravity and latent heat. AToS has 
                also succeeded in formulating the gravitation constant G as a 
                simple and elegant quantum function employing only fundamental 
                quantities. This then opened the way for the integration of electric

                Research Institute (ABRI) is geared to take advantage of the multiple 
                breakthroughs of Aetherometry by creating a nexus of distinct 
                efforts targeting the further development of all the disciplines 
                of Aetherometry (with respect both to education and research) 
                concomitantly with the development of its various technological 
                embodiments. The ABRI's complex research process is placed at 
                the merger of Physics and Biophysics. When Leo Szilard learned 
                that biological clocks were not affected fundamentally by temperature, 
                he commented - &quot;if there is an undiscovered principle of 
                physics, it seems likely that the biosphere will have employed 
                it&quot;. The ABRI's research aims precisely at teasing out the 
                Physics of the Aether which are responsible for the functions 
                and genesis of both mass-energy and living systems, since the 
                dynamic Aether - or at any rate a fundamental portion of it - 
                is precisely that energy principle which the biosphere employs 
                to control its synthetic machinery and which Physics is only now 
                vaguely awakening to. The foundation provided by Aetherometry 
                enables thought to seize the entirety of nature, whether animate 
                or inanimate, as being energetically alive. Since the present 
                development of Aetherometry permits and demands a series of linked 
                basic research projects in the domains of bioelectricity and biological 
                clocks, microbial biogenesis, electrogravitation, thermoelectric 
                conversion and the utilization of high-frequency, high-potential 
                'alternating' currents to perform work and transmit power; and 
                since AToS predicts specific fine structure for both massbound 
                and massfree charge, the hard core of the ABRI's 'mission' will 
                consist of those theoretical and experimental research efforts 
                that aim at exploiting our basic findings and testing the aetherometric 
                predictions. Surrounding the nexus of these basic projects, there 
                is another level of projects having an applied nature and aiming 
                at the benign technological exploitation of the existing and forthcoming 
                discoveries in basic science. These range from hardware and software 
                design and development to construction of prototypes and the design 
                of autonomous housing utilizing the new energy technologies.</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Toward the end of 
                the nineteenth century, scientists believed they were close to 
                a complete description of the universe. They imagined that space 
                was filled by a continuous medium called the ether. Light rays 
                and radio signals were waves in  this ether, just as sound is 
                pressure waves in air.  All that was needed for a complete theory 
                were careful measurements of the elastic properties of the ether.  
                In fact, anticipating such measurements, the Jefferson Lab at 
                Harvard University was built entirely without iron nails so as 
                not to interfere with delicate magnetic measurements Einstein 
                had overthrown two of the absolutes of nineteenth-century science: 
                absolute rest, as represented by the ether, and absolute or universal 
                time that all clocks would measure.(I still get two or three 
                letters a week telling me Einstein was wrong.) Nevertheless, the 
                theory of relativity is now completely accepted by the scientific 
                community, and its predictions have been verified in countless 
                applications.pp.4-11.</p>
