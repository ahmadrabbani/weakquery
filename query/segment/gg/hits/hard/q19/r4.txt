Videos    Responsible Business; the low carbon economy , a movie produced in cooperation with CNBC    Interview of Benoît Beylier, Airstar CEO (France)    Interview of Eric Prades, Hydrogen Energy Director at Air Liquide    Fossil fuels represent more than  80% of world consumption , and transport in particular depends  95% on oil. While reserves are diminishing, worldwide demand is constantly increasing, due to the emergence of certain economies. Experts estimate that the global demand for energy could rise by more than 50% between 2009 and 2030 and that oil  production will reach a  peak around 2020/2030. Burning fossil fuels generates CO 2 , a greenhouse gas that is the primary cause of global warming. It is necessary to develop alternative sources of energy. To meet the specific needs of transport, these energies must be easy to store. Hydrogen, produced independently of oil and combined with the fuel cell, is one of these alternatives. It can be produced using a variety of sources: natural gas, biomass, water and electricity, and be easily stored in various liquid or gaseous forms. It is easy to store, and refill containers. In a  fuel cell , hydrogen combines with the oxygen in the air to   produce electricity and only discharges water   . It is the ideal fuel to power  cars  fitted with an electric engine which produce their own electricity on board and do not pollute. For more than 40 years, Air Liquide has  controlled    the whole industrial hydrogen chain  and today it is participating in the  development of hydrogen energy in two areas: innovation and real-scale demonstration programmes. In the field of innovation, the Group is developing solutions for the production, storage, distribution and use of hydrogen. Air Liquide is participating in various real-scale demonstration projects.
