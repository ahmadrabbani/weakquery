Abstract:
Fossil fuels currently supply most of the world?s energy needs, and
however unacceptable their long-term consequences. Hydrogen is a promising
alternative energy carrier.H2 has the highest possible energy density of
any hydrogen-based fuel. Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier in future
energy systems. However, storage of hydrogen is a substantial challenge,
especially for applications in vehicles with fuel cells. Here I will
discuss production, storage, transport and consumption of hydrogen and
different methods for hydrogen storage are discussed, including
high-pressure and cryogenic-liquid storage, adsorptive storage on
high-surface-area adsorbents, chemisorption and physisorption etc .Of the
challenges that are still to be met to enable the widespread use of H2 as
a fuel for automotive applications, a safe, reliable and cheap method for
its storage and transportation is paramount. This need has prompted a
massive effort in the synthesis and characterisation of novel hydrides and
a better understanding of existing materials. Increased attention is being
focused on metal?organic frameworks as candidates for hydrogen storage
materials. This is a result of their many favorable attributes, such as
high porosity, reproducible and facile syntheses, amenability to scale-up,
and chemical modification for targeting desired properties. Clathrate
hydrates are inclusion compounds in which guest molecules occupy the cages
formed by a hydrogen-bonded water network. Specifically, water-based
clathrate hydrates can host a significant amount of H2 within
hydrogen-bonded water cages, with interesting features such as multiple
cavity occupation. The structures, stabilities, occupancies, and dynamics
of hydrogen clathrates and highlights recent developments towards hydrogen
storage will be discussed in this seminar. Reference:
