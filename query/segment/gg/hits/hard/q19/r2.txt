Think outside the hydrogen tank  November 18, 2011 By Kyle Todd  Enlarge   One of Professor Eric Wachsman's solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) (PhysOrg.com) -- When most people hear the words "fuel cell," they think of eco-friendly, hydrogen-powered cars that emit nothing more than water.         6     loading ...

The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) recent decisions about how to fund  fuel cell research, he says, are putting the country at risk of falling behind in the development and implementation of the most efficient means of converting fuel to electricity. Fuel cells have up to three times the efficiency of an internal combustion engine. "There is a problem in the perception of the public and policy makers, and in the funding of our fuel cell programs, that hydrogen and fuel cells are linked," says Wachsman, a faculty member at the university's A. James Clark School of Engineering. "Hydrogen-based fuel cells are the technology that has gotten all of the press and as a result we're still waiting for a future  hydrogen infrastructure . Yes, fuel cells can run off hydrogen, but they don't have to." Another problem, Wachsman says, is America's fixation on vehicles. "It will take decades to create a nationwide hydrogen distribution and  storage system , and to convert every gas station into a hydrogen filling station. That reality has turned fuel cells into a 'future technology' and has resulted in a drastic reduction in the funding of fuel cell research by the DOE in favor of developing  electric cars , when in fact fuel cells can be used right now in many stationary and  mobile applications , including centralized  power distribution and power generation for homes, businesses, and industry." Most people are unaware that there are two kinds of fuel cells. The one in the public eye, the  proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, uses hydrogen to generate power. The type of fuel cell Wachsman and his colleagues have worked to perfect, the  solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), has a distinct advantage over its PEM-based sibling.    "Solid oxide fuel cells are unique because they can oxidize any fuel," Wachsman explains. "They can run off of gasoline, diesel and natural gas today, and biofuels and  hydrogen in the future, whenever that infrastructure is in place." Hot Technology  Still, nothing's perfect, and Wachsman can sum up the reason why SOFCs aren't in large-scale production in a word: temperature. "That is the issue," he explains. "It's the reason why the automotive companies are using PEM fuel cells. PEM fuel cells operate at around 80 degrees Celsius [180 degrees Fahrenheit], which allows them to startup fairly quickly. Current solid oxide fuel cells currently operate at 800 degrees Celsius [1500 degrees Fahrenheit], so it takes a long time to warm up to operating temperature, making them more applicable to stationary power generation." Wachsman and his colleagues are working to change that.  In an article in the November 18 issue of   Science  , the team outlines the technology behind a new world record power density SOFC that generates two watts of power per square centimeter at 650 degrees Celsius [1200 degrees Fahrenheit]. The cell uses a bi-layer electrolyte developed by Wachsman that is more than 100 times more conductive than the conventional zirconia-based electrolyte operating at the same temperaturealso a world record. When the cells are assembled into a stack they should produce three kilowatts of electricity per kilogram of material, more than an  internal combustion engine at approximately one-third the size. The paper lays out a strategy to further lower temperature. The team believes its improvements to SOFC electrolytes and nanostructured-electrode designs could ultimately reduce the cells' operating temperature to only 350 degrees Celsius [660 degrees Fahrenheit]. At that temperature they could start up fast enough for automotive applications, and would be more efficient and more affordable than current SOFCs because they could be manufactured from less expensive materials.

SOFC warming up can also be aided with EL heater.  But if the SOFC can just reach temperature as you reach your destination, what's the point? The longer it takes to start up, the more energy you waste. Heating up a kilogram of iron for example by 650 degrees takes 300 kJ of energy. Now, if your "engine" weighs 25 kilograms for 100 HP on the pedal, and you need all that warmed up before you go, that's 2 kWh or 1/4 a liter of gasoline wasted right there. With that amount of fuel, you would already be 2 miles down the road, or 5-6 miles if we assume that the fuel cell has three times the fuel economy. So it's quickly apparent that the efficiency of the car suffers a lot on short trips. Could work for a taxi, because it doesn't have time to cool down. report abuse  Current rank 1  2  3  4  5      Eikka 3 hours ago  Rank:   5 / 5 (1)  The main issue of cold starting such an engine is however, that it requires a lot of power to do quickly. Suppose you have a 5 kilogram version of the hypothetical fuel cell that is made of iron; it needs 417 Wh to come online, which is just about what you could pull out of a regular car battery. The trouble is that it would take 10-15 minutes at a reasonable rate so that the battery doesn't boil over, and the battery would be empty after just one start. report abuse  Current rank 1  2  3  4  5      Noodle_Naut 1 hour ago  Rank:  not rated yet  Seems to me it could be insulated in an advanced thermos of some kind and simply maintained at the high temperature whether the car is running or not. If it can operate in say a 200 degree range and it looses say .5 degrees per hour it should remain operable for quite a while. It could use a battery to keep it above the minimum temperature all the time. If the charge gets low then the fuel cell just turns on and charges up the battery. If you are going to go on vacation or put it in storage or it is being garaged where the CO2 buildup could be a problem then there is a switch to shut it down. You simply use an outlet to get it hot again in say 20 minutes. A simple CO2 external air sensor could recognize when CO2 buildup is becoming a risk and shut down automatically to avoid danger if someone forgot to turn it off and it has been left for a few hundred hours.  report abuse  Current rank 1  2  3  4  5      Noodle_Naut 1 hour ago  Rank:   5 / 5 (1)  I think if you can make this tech reasonably affordable and reliable, semi tractor tailor operators would defiantly want it even if it could not be insulated as I suggested. It could make driving far more efficient and save a lot of money. They often keep them running 24 hours a day anyway. report abuse  Current rank 1  2  3  4  5           Rank   1  2  3  4  5     5 /5 (4 votes)   Tags proton exchange membrane ,  internal combustion engine ,  hydrogen infrastructure ,  solid oxide fuel cell ,  fuel cell ,  storage system ,  electric cars ,  mobile applications ,  power distribution ,  hydrogen   Related Stories Low temperature fuel cells: New clean, energy efficient technology to power cars and mobiles  Jan 13, 2009 |  not rated yet |  0  Hydrogen-fueled cars stuck at the gate  Feb 21, 2008 |  not rated yet |  0  Sandia polymer electrolyte membrane brings goal of a high temperature PEM fuel cell closer  Jun 14, 2004 |  not rated yet |  0  Methane-powered laptops may be closer than you think  Nov 17, 2010 |  not rated yet |  0  Fuel cells, energy conversion and mathematics  Jul 24, 2009 |  not rated yet |  0     Featured  Last comments  Popular  Most shared  Partners   Scientists solve mystery of the eye  Nov 17, 2011 |   4.7 / 5 (18) |   2  Quantum error correction in solid state processing  Nov 16, 2011 |   4.5 / 5 (4) |   1  Tall water waves behave unexpectedly  Nov 15, 2011 |   4.8 / 5 (16) |   1  From the Earth to the Moon: Resolving estimates of proto-Earth accretion with lunar-forming impact  Nov 14, 2011 |   5 / 5 (6) |   16  Researchers take first steps toward X-ray superfluorescence  Nov 14, 2011 |   4.6 / 5 (11) |   4     more news      Relevant PhysicsForums posts Any Ideas for Civil Engineering Specialization(CET) Project for the whole SEMESTER  5 hours ago   Second semester had just started and prior to my CET subject for this sem, our professor let us suggest what project we will be making for this whole semester individually.
