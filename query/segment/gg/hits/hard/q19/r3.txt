That’s why E.ON plans to  develop a pilot energy storage plant in Falkenhagen in the northeast of Germany . The facility, being built at a cost of more than €5 million ($6.8 million), will be designed to convert wind power into hydrogen that can be stored in the country’s gas grid for use when needed. Set to begin operating in 2013, the plant will use electrolysis — running an electrical current through water — to produce  an expected 360 cubic meters of hydrogen each hour. That hydrogen will be fed into Germany’s Ontras gas pipeline system to be used just like natural gas, essentially turning the gas grid into an energy storage system. Currently, up to 5 percent hydrogen can be added to the natural gas grid without problems. In the medium term, that percentage is expected to rise to 15 percent … which would make it possible for all of the renewable energy generated in Germany today to be stored as hydrogen in the nation’s gas grid. However, demand for that kind of capacity isn’t expected until most of the country’s power comes from renewable sources, most likely a few decades from now. “We need new storage capacities so that we can further increase the share of weather-dependent wind power in our generation portfolio in coming years,” said Klaus-Dieter Maubach, a member of the E.ON board responsible for technology and development. “Using the existing gas infrastructure to store hydrogen is a promising approach in the long run, enabling us to combine our strengths as a power and gas company.” Bookmark and share:                                        A fuel-cell system first: hydrogen, electricity and heat energy   Hydrogen power could help stabilize energy grid  Solar, wind power could provide a boost for hydrogen   Sneak peek of the hydrogen economy  Innovation could store renewable energy as hydrogen fuel  Could a New Zealand bacterium foster a hydrogen economy?
