Not the kind you are probably imagining and we are not actually fighting as we speak. Rather, every night when we go to bed, we are both vying for one particular pillow. What is this pillow that is so luxurious it has become the cause of marital strife? It is Coco-Mat's Sithon pillow.  There are two aspects of the Coco-Mat pillow that sets it apart from other brands. First, Coco-Mat pillows are made out of 100 percent natural materials that come from sustainable sources and are 100 percent recyclable. Second, Coco-Mat pillows provide the support and comfort your neck and shoulders need for you to achieve the best sleep possible.  This support is furnished by a combination of the materials used and the design in which they are created. There are several versions of Coco-Mat pillows, but each has between four and six different compartments that enable the pillows to conform to your body, relieving neck and shoulder pressure. With a Coco-Mat pillow, you can finally stop folding your pillow or sliding your arm under your head and neck.  In most versions of Coco-Mat pillows, three of the compartments are filled with goose down. This soft, light filling is warm when you are cold and cool when you feel hot. Goose down is able to regulate humidity as well, making it a material of choice on hot summer nights in north Texas. The down compartments are machine washable and easy to clean.  The remaining one to three compartments of most versions of Coco-Mat pillows are filled with a material you would probably not anticipate. Believe it or not, my favorite pillow includes natural rubber stuffing. This is not recycled automobile tires, but natural, pure rubber.    1  2   Next Page    Published by  Tricia Goss  Tricia Goss is a freelance writer who lives in North Texas.

Suzanne Alicie 10/18/2010  I have seen these pillows and as someone who always has trouble getting comfy on a pillow I have to admit to considering splurging on one of these.
