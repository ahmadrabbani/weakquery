﻿      HOME     GOING GREEN     TESTIMONIALS    Used Tires Portland  Or We have over 120 sets in stock.              The modern automobile is almost 100% recyclable. Junkyards around the world use to be filled with the remains of automobiles, and used tires used to be stacked up in landfills or discarded on rural properties that were convenient and secluded dump sites. Fortunately yesterday's waste habits are disappearing. Car manufacturers are producing automobiles that are almost completely recyclable, and consumers are using recyclable tires in a variety of ways. One way is to buy and use tires that have been recycled for everyday transportation purposes.   Recycled tires reduce the number of scrap tires that the US produces every year.  Two hundred and fifty million tires are scraped each year, and it takes a scrap tire about fifty years to decompose on its own. The waste is staggering, and that kind of strain on the environment is not sustainable as we move through the twenty-first century. Thanks to modern technology buying recycled tires for personal automobiles is a practical and efficient way to save money and to help reduce environmental waste.  The days when tire retreads were made in a somewhat primitive fashion and sold as an inferior substitute for new tires are gone. Modern recycling technology is producing recycled tires that are functional, safe, and cost effective. With proper use and maintenance recycled tires will be just as reliable as new tires.   Buying quality recycled tires also reduces the nation's dependency on oil and keeps prices in line.  Quality recycled tires reduce the nation's dependency on oil in several ways. The fuel cost drops when a good set of recycled tires are properly maintained, plus less new rubber is introduced into the automobile industry each year. Most trucks use recycled tires to deliver groceries and other goods, and airlines depend on recycled tires to keep air travel prices low. Recycled tires keep new tire prices in line, and road, bridge, and new building construction costs are reduced when recycled tires replace new tires.             It is pretty clear the utilizing recycled tires can have many benefits for car owners as well as the environment.    One place to find the highest quality and lowest priced used tries is The Tire Shop in Portland, Oregon.    They sell sets starting at $100, and that includes mounting, balancing, and disposal of your old tires.
