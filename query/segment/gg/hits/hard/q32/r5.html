		The modern automobile is almost 100% recyclable. Junkyards around the 
		world use to be filled with the remains of automobiles, and used tires 
		used to be stacked up in landfills or discarded on rural properties that 
		were convenient and secluded dump sites. Fortunately yesterday's waste 
		habits are disappearing. Car manufacturers are producing automobiles 
		that are almost completely recyclable, and consumers are using 
		recyclable tires in a variety of ways. One way is to buy and use tires 
		that have been recycled for everyday transportation purposes. <br />
		<br />
		<span class="style29"><strong>Recycled tires reduce the number of scrap tires that the US produces 
		every year.</strong></span> Two hundred and fifty million tires are scraped each year, 
		and it takes a scrap tire about fifty years to decompose on its own. The 
		waste is staggering, and that kind of strain on the environment is not 
		sustainable as we move through the twenty-first century. Thanks to 
		modern technology buying recycled tires for personal automobiles is a 
		practical and efficient way to save money and to help reduce 
		environmental waste. <br />
		<br />
		The days when tire retreads were made in a somewhat primitive fashion 
		and sold as an inferior substitute for new tires are gone. Modern 
		recycling technology is producing recycled tires that are functional, 
		safe, and cost effective. With proper use and maintenance recycled tires 
		will be just as reliable as new tires. <br />
		<br />
		<span class="style29"><strong>Buying quality recycled tires also reduces the nation's dependency on 
		oil and keeps prices in line.</strong></span> Quality recycled tires reduce the nation's 
		dependency on oil in several ways. The fuel cost drops when a good set 
		of recycled tires are properly maintained, plus less new rubber is 
		introduced into the automobile industry each year. Most trucks use 
		recycled tires to deliver groceries and other goods, and airlines depend 
		on recycled tires to keep air travel prices low. Recycled tires keep new 
		tire prices in line, and road, bridge, and new building construction 
		costs are reduced when recycled tires replace new tires.<o:p></o:p></span><span class="style28">
