The Baltimore Sun's Jill Rosen, <a href="http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/features/mutts/blog/" target="_blank">author of the Unleashed blog</a>, where you can read much more about this incident, reports that Bear-Bear became entangled in another dog when its owner opened fire in the Quail Run dog park.</p><p>The off-duty federal officer has not been identified. But a day after his police force said no crime had been committed, County Executive John R. Leopold said he was &quot;deeply troubled&quot; by the shooting and he <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/anne-arundel/bs-md-ar-dog-shooting-20100804,0,3761982.story" target="_blank">ordered the investigation re-opened</a>, calling it&nbsp;a priority.</p><p>&quot;This investigation is far from complete,&quot; the county's police chief James Teare said Wednesday afternoon. &quot;The Police Department takes this very seriously and will continue to investigate all aspects of the case.&quot;</p><p>Dog walkers question whether the officer shot too quickly in a public park crowded with dog owners and children, and whether he did enough to stop the dogs --&nbsp; playing off the leash in a fenced in play area -- from fighting before turning to his weapon. The officer had told police that he feared for the life of his dog and his family.</p><p>Here is the latest statement from <a href="http://www.aacounty.org/Police/" target="_blank">Anne Arundel County Police</a>:</p>

Officers spoke with a 32-year-old off-duty federal police officer, who advised that he and his wife were at the dog park with their leashed German Shepherd dog (Asia) when Bear approached and jumped on his dog. The off-duty federal officer advised that he yelled for the male subject with Bear to come get his dog. According to the officer, Bear began to bite his dog. The off-duty federal officer stated he attempted to get Husky off his dog, but the Husky turned and attempted to bite him before biting his dog a second time. The off-duty officer stated that he feared for the safety of himself, his wife and their dog and subsequently shot the Huskie with a handgun he had in his possession.&nbsp; </p><p>Officers then spoke with the male subject who had the Husky at the park. He stated that Bear and the off-duty federal officer&rsquo;s dog appeared to be playing with each other at the time and that his dog was friendly and never had any problems before at the park.&nbsp; </p><p>Animal Control officers responded and the dog was transported to the Anne Arundel Veterinary Emergency Clinic in Annapolis, where the dog later died at approximately 9:30 p.m. At this time, the investigation into this incident is ongoing. The name of the off-duty federal officer is not being released at this time.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;This investigation is not complete. The police department takes this incident very seriously and will continue to investigate all aspects of the case,&rdquo; said Chief of Police Colonel James Teare, Sr.<br /></p>

                                 <p>Major questions arise:<br />
1. Was there any injury to Asia? Did Bear-Bear ever break the skin?<br />
2. What was the duration of this incident?<br />
3. Why on Earth would someone bring a dog into the dog park on a leash?<br />
4. Why didn't the Asia's owner just take his dog out of the park?  Should not have been difficult as he was on a leash.<br />
5. There were two adults there.  Could they not handle one husky?<br />
6. Was the gun licensed? Did they have a permit for the gun? Did the county officer even check on this?<br />
7. Did the federal officer's "credentials" had any impact on the county's initial reaction?<br />
8. Were there any other witnesses?</p>

<p>No one is above the law.  I look forward to this matter being taken seriously, not just for the dog/owner's sake, but for the public at large.  It would be really a bad thing if this person is allowed to continue to have a gun as his judgement seems severely compromised.<br />

                                 <p>It seems like the investigation is tainted from the very begining since the good-old-boy County police declared no crime had been committed. The people who need to be investigated are James Teare and Leopold for their mismanagement of the County Police. </p>

<p>An independant investigation, maybe by the state police, should occur. And if the Federal Office did violate the law then the authorities may actually be able to prosecute him.</p>

                                 <p>My 12 year old lab mix was mauled by a dog twice his size about 8 years ago.  He had blood spraying out of his chest and could not walk for 2 weeks.  He obviously survived and has lived a good life, the point being a german shepherd can stand toe-to-toe with a husky any day of the week.  The officer completely overreacted as he apparaently does not understand dogs very well.  First, no dog should be left on a leash when all the other dogs run free, this is threatening to the dog on the leash.  Second, the Husky breed is inherently al little more agrressive than many other breeds but that does not mean they are dangerous at all (they can just be very mouthy).  It seems like the officer misunderstood the intentions of the Husky and pannicked.  I have a dog that is very mouthy and if you don't understand him, he appears to be aggressive.  But he plays that way with my 17 month old and never leaves a mark on him - EVER!  This is a tragic incident as it never should have happened.  I do not know the facts but from everything I've read, it really looks like the officer totally overreacted and, if this is the case, needs to be chraged and disciplined.  He's a federal police officer -  where was his personal control and overall discipline in a stressful situation?</p>

                                 <p>I find it interesting that this is the top news story on most of the local stations' news programs.  Citizen shot and killed in Baltimore?  Not as important as the shooting of a dog, apparently.  9 people murdered in a workplace shooting?  Well, at least they weren't poor helpless dogs.  Poor Bear-Bear, a promising life cut short on the mean streets of AA County by a madman with a gun.  It seems as if more tears have been shed for this dog than for Mr. Pitcairn.  Anyone remember him, or is that old news already?</p>

                                 <p>PghSteve, the media can usually handle more than one story at a time. However, this story has become national in scope so it is no surprise that it becomes a lead story for the paper. </p>

<p>This is more than a dog shot, though any pet owner can empathize with the pain of this action. This is a federal officer, discharging a fire arm in a public place, with other people, including children around. This is a man who from witness testimony, wasn't even sure exactly where he was firing, and fired his gun irresponsibly, and in a panic. </p>

<p>This is about dog owners being able to go to dog parks and not be afraid that some irresponsible person won't panic and kill their pets.</p>

<p>And this is about the police not doing a decent investigation. It was as irresponsible for the police to not investigate this more thoroughly. By all indications, if this man had not been a federal officer, they would have investigated more thoroughly and that should be disturbing to folks, and is "real" news.</p>

                                 <p>I see your point, PghSteve, But I believe you are oversimplifying the situation.  It is not just about a beloved pet being killed. It is about public safety, judgement and mental stability of a federal police officer who we trust with a gun, and police action (or lack thereof). These are very serious issues that should be thoroughly investigated.</p>

                                 <p>All dog parks I have attended have rules usually including No dogs on leash.<br />
It has been my experience that people bring their dog on a leash when either:<br />
1. The dog has behavior/aggression problems<br />
2. They have no idea how their dog is going to behave with other dogs at the dog park.</p>

<p>In either case they should not have been in the park with their dog.</p>

<p>Was their dog injured in any way? Normal dog play can be quite rough with a lot of mouthing/play biting, wrestling and growling. </p>

<p>Now their dog may not have been comfortable with the level of roughness my own dog often isn't. I remove the other dog/ distract the other dog if necessary and ask the other owner to do something about it and if I have to for my dog's comfort I leave. </p>

<p>Shooting another dog in an area with a high number of people and other animals can only be justified if other reasonable means to separate the dogs were tried and his dog was actually in danger and being injured.</p>

<p>My own dog has been attacked and injured at the dog park 2 occasions . It happens fast and is scary. But rarely is it fatal and not usually when the dogs are close in size like these. Most often it is a lot of noise and no injury. I question the judgment of the person with the gun and the reasonableness of his reaction. It shouldn't be just if he says he felt threatened in a situation like this it should be if actions were the ones of a reasonable person would make in this situation. It certainly seems if the police did not investigate like they would have if a "regular" person was involved.</p>

                                 <p>I’m sorry but I find this very disturbing and it’s happening more often look at the pit bul shooting of poor lovable Bella by a another police officer a few months ago. What’s wrong with these officers this is a clear case of  abuse of authority. Who gives him the right to shoot his weapon when he’s off duty? he has no right. When a police officer is doing this off duty could you just imagine his bad judgment when he‘s on duty? So, me too if I’m a police officer I can shoot my gun whenever I want and at whatever I want in any situation I want, wow Rambo cops on the loose,  the other thing is that  “Anne Arundel County police said their investigation into a federal officer who fatally shot a dog in a park had concluded without charges.” Wow is that a cover up or what?  So if nobody said anything this would all blow over and Rambo cop would get away with it. Wow who’s watching these guys? Don’t they even remember the oath they took to god? Everyone is responsible for their actions and there are Serious repercussions  for the wrong actions it doesn’t matter who you are or your station. Why just because it’s a dog it doesn’t matter, yes it does to his family to the people that dog brought unconditional love to. Everything matters. And you have to respect that.   <br />
R.I.P poor Bear-Bear at least you had a couple of years of love and a good home after all you went through. Run free in the sun over rainbow bridge.<br />

                                 <p>If a private citizen with a carry permit had done this, they'd be named in the paper and a list of charges pending would be posted as well.</p>

<p>But because it is a Federal police officer, he gets more discretion.  Appalling.</p>

<p>I am tired of this "us vs. them" mentality of the police.  Police officers ARE NOT special.  They are simply individuals who have chosen law enforcement as a full-time profession, nothing more.  Yes, it is dangerous.   But they are entrusted with responsibilities to cope with that and should and must be held to a higher standard as a result.  The fact this was initially covered up and dismissed as nothing to investigate indicates they don't need to justify themselves to anyone.</p>

<p>That needs to change.  Is it anyone wonder the average person on the street doesn't trust the police?  Why should we?  What repercussions do they suffer?  If anything, they should endure greater punishment for their misdeeds.</p>

<p>This officer should be held to the same standard that any individual with a carry permit would be.  No thin blue line.  If it is good enough for us, it is good enough for them.</p>

                                 <p>I completely agree that any shooting in a public place must be fully investigated.  That should be the focus of the stories, but in my view the focus has been on the death of the dog.  I love dogs, my Australian Shepherd is sitting 2 feet from me now as I type this.  However, the death of a dog is not more important than the death of a human being, or of several human beings.  When several TV stations place this story first in their news programs, it certainly implies that it is the most important and/or newsworthy story of the day.</p>

<p>The discharge of a weapon in a crowded park needs to be investigated, and charges or other actions brought if the person's actions were illegal or inappropriate.</p>

It has clearly been all about the dog and people have said that this guy is guilty without barely hearing both sides of the story.  It is also sickening that this story has already made the deaths of Steve Pitcairn, Milton Hill, and others already forgettable.</p>

                                 <p>I fully agree that a human life is the most precious thing on earth, but if this story had no media coverage it would just get swept under the rug.. The only help the owners of bear -bear have is to get the story out, One person can make a change but many can make one small voice loud enough  for the world to hear. Personally I like animals better than some people I know. lol  <br />

                                 <p>Huskys do bear their teeth when playing. We have one and we have brought stray cat in and they got along fine. From what I understand Bear was abused when he was small. To many people have seen Bear play with other dogs. I believe the federal a....brought his dog there to start the fight or intimidate Bear. Fed or not he needs to have his gun taken away. I had to stop a fight with a routweiler and a small dog he was about to kill. I did not need a gun. I beat the routweiler off and he ran.</p>

                                 <p>An off-duty federal officer shooting a family dog to death in a dog park?  OMG! My heart goes to Bear-Bear's owners. For the "officer:"  You are a menace to society!  To the AAC Police:  You are nothing but a bunch of ill-trained, ill-mannered good old boy bunch of morons who abuse their power and are a menace to the public they are supposed to serve!  I've had some very uncalled-for experiences with those people and know first hand what they're all about.  I expect a big house cleaning at that place, in particular the Eastern Division.  Closing the case indeed!  The worse part is that were it not for the public outrage/outcry about this, it would have just been swept under the carpet!  Apalling, just appaling.  Who do we turn to for REAL protection?  My thanks to the Baltimore Sun for exposing this horrible event!</p>

                                 <p>As I recall, wasn't there an incident in America where a police officer only waved his gun at some children throwing snowballs at him but he got a warning - he didnt discharge his weapon but he still got repremanded. </p>

<p>My concern is that this guy is a federal officer in fear for his life from a fluffy little dog who didnt leave one scratch on him - please tell me he only works on a desk if something that basic gets him "so scared" he definately shouldnt be working in the field!!</p>

                                 <p>I've got to agree with most off these comments this is outrages that a police office that isn't even on duty is aloud to carry a gun I mean what if he'd have accidently shoot a person or a child would they have said that wasn't a crime too, I live in the uk and own 3 Huskies they are known to play fight and play really ruff my dogs some times drag each other round the garden by the scuff of the neck but have never harmed each other they do make a lot of noise that sounds like there fighting for real this is actually called Husky play over in UK the scary thing is that they were just going to let this guy get away with it we are trying to introduce dog parks in to the uk but hearing stories like this makes me wonder if there would be safe. Huskies are a really friendly lovable breed and are really good family dogs I find it really hard to belive the husky attacked the police officer its not in there nature unless they have been cornered and feel threatened just like most breeds, I have a 3 year old daughter that grabs and jumps all over my Huskies and they have never even so much as growled at her they just lick her and nugg her with there noses. I feel for Bears owners to have lost a member of there family run free lovely Bear over rainbow bridge R.I.P.</p>

In 2001, he was assigned to Jerusalem as the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>'s Middle East correspondent. He returned in 2005 as an assistant city editor overseeing crime coverage. In 2008, Peter returned to the beat as a daily reporter and blogger. A recent <a href="http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/blog/2009/05/bbc_crime_video.html">BBC report</a> featured him in a segment on the harsh realities of covering crime in Baltimore.
<br><br>
 
Coverage will focus on crime trends, problems in neighborhoods in the city and elsewhere, profiles of victims and police officers and try to offer readers a fresh perspective on one of the most vexing issues facing Baltimore and its future.</span><br><br>
