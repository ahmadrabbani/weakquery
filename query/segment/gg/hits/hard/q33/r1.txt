Please remember, the Military Working Dog Foundation is not a government agency, but rather a 501c3 non-profit. We have no funding or say whatsoever in what police department or other law enforcement agency receives a dog for patrol/detection duties via the U.S. Military's Working Dog Center's LE assistance program.  Our new online form for LE agencies and PD's will be online shortly.   Enter your email address to subscribe to our mailing list.
