I often find myself striving to explain that even friendly fire accidents, in which soldiers or airmen kill their own people, are part of the price we must pay for asking young men armed with lethal weapons to make split-second decisions in the heat of battle.  But the carnage that accompanied the rescue of a kidnapped British journalist in Afghanistan early on Wednesday leaves a bitter taste.   A soldier of the British Army's special forces support group was killed.   The reporter's Afghan interpreter was shot down, along with at least one civilian and unnumbered Taliban fighters.  All this happened in the course of an operation to recover Stephen Farrell, who had ventured against the strongest advice into an almost suicidally dangerous area, in pursuit of a story for his paper, the New York Times.  The usual defence is being offered for Farrell's actions: That he was a courageous seeker after truth.   He had travelled to interview survivors of a German air strike against fuel tankers hijacked by the Taliban, which killed scores of civilians.  If reporters such as himself do not take risks, the argument goes, if the public must instead depend for information on evasive or deceitful official statements, then we shall never discover the facts about things done in our name.  Yet there are risks and risks. Once upon a time, journalists in most war zones were recognised by the combatants as neutral spectators.   They were sometimes killed by chance shells or small-arms fire, but seldom deliberately targeted.   During the Vietnam war, for instance, Western reporters who fell into communist hands were usually freed sooner or later.  Today, however, in most of the world's war zones journalists are perceived by insurgents, especially Islamic militants, as hated infidels, as fit for death as Western soldiers.    More... Should Para have died to rescue a gung-ho reporter?     In Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, even the Balkans, reporters have been shot, beheaded, or otherwise murdered in numbers unmatched since the Second World War.  Every media organisation and reporter knows this, and most respond accordingly.   In Iraq and Afghanistan, few journalists travel except under military escort.   It is simply too perilous to attempt the things that are media routine elsewhere: Seeing for themselves and talking to local people.  Measuring danger is part of every journalist's job.   Good ones, even the best and bravest, recognise a responsibility not to expose themselves foolishly.   Nonetheless, every war zone breeds its own zealots, who ignore the risks in pursuit of sensation or glory.  Now Mr Farrell may be eminently sensible but the fact remains that he had been nicknamed 'robohack' by rivals and had ignored explicit warnings that there was a high probability of a similar occurrence in the area of Northern Afghanistan to which he had travelled.  He is by no means the first to have pressed ahead regardless of the risks.   In 1970, the American photographer Sean Flynn rode a motorbike across Cambodia, and fell into the hands of murderous Khmer Rouge guerrillas.   Flynn was recognised throughout Indochina as a 'nutter'.   The exact manner of his death was never established, but local rumour held that he was crucified.  I remember thinking that the Khmer Rouge were probably the first people Sean had ever met who neither knew nor cared that he was the son of hell-raising Hollywood star Errol Flynn.  In action: Max Hastings was credited as the first Briton into Argentinian-held Port Stanley during the Falklands crisis   In my own years as a war correspondent, I tried to measure risk carefully.   I have never forgotten my dismay, accompanying 42 Commando into an attack during the 1982 Falklands War, when a very brave radio colleague named Kim Sabido asked to accompany the lead rifle company  -  and did so.  I stayed 400 yards further back because I reckoned  -  rightly  -  that I would see as much from that vantage point, at much lower risk. We both survived to tell the tale.   But let us be honest, I did not have as much bottle as Kim Sabido.  Correspondents are sometimes tempted into playing a game of grandmothers' footsteps with battlefield colleagues and rivals.   They say to themselves: 'If he or she is going this far into harm's way, maybe I should go one step further'. That is how journalists get killed.  There was just one occasion when I stuck my own neck out  -  to walk into the Argentine lines outside Port Stanley ahead of the advancing British Army in June 1982.  Years afterwards, I met the Argentine officer who first saw me that morning. I asked why he did not shoot me. He answered with a shrug: 'You did not look like a soldier.  'As far as I knew, there was no lunatic asylum on the Falklands Islands. So I assumed you must be a journalist'.  I was thrilled with my brief moment of fame, which gained me a priceless scoop. But now, almost 30 years later, thinking of Stephen Farrell, I find myself remembering the fury of the British Parachute Regiment colonel outside Stanley that day.  He said he would never take me on an operation again, because my behaviour had been so irresponsible. 'I wouldn't have minded if the Argentines shot you,' he said. 'But you might have got people who really mattered killed, like my soldiers, if your stunt had started another firefight on the Stanley road.'  The colonel was right. What I did reflected egotism and a lust for personal glory, rather than any higher purpose of getting a story which the British people needed to know.   John Simpson of the BBC did much the same when he walked into Kabul ahead of allied forces in 2001  -  and was criticised for similar reasons.  Now that I am older and hopefully a little wiser, I can blush for the selfishness of what I did in the Falklands in 1982, as perhaps Stephen Farrell ought to be blushing in Kabul today. Of course reporters should not always heed official warnings.   If they did, especially in war zones, the version of events which they transmit to the world would reveal nothing beyond government hand-outs.  But at every turn, good journalists  -  and their bosses in London or New York  -  need to ask: Is it essential to go to this place, to take this chance, to acquire vital information? Are the risks reasonable? Am I taking this chance because the story demands it? Or for thrills and fame?  In fairness to Stephen Farrell, he never asked anybody to risk their lives to free him from the tiger's jaws into which he had walked. The real lesson of his experience is that journalists who report wars must do so at their own risk  -  and suffer the consequences of a misjudgment.  It seems misguided of the British Government to have approved or perhaps initiated  -  the facts are not yet clear  -  an operation which cost men's lives, to free a journalist stuck in a hole of his own digging.  In my days as a newspaper editor, had I been asked whether such a raid should be launched to liberate a correspondent whom I employed, I would unhesitatingly have answered: No.  The war correspondent's role is vital. But, by its nature, it attracts adventurous spirits who seek romance, glamour, and the thrill of overcoming danger. They gamble with their lives, and sometimes lose them.   But most would honestly admit that they do the job, as I once did, in pursuit of the thrill and challenge, rather than in fulfilment of higher ideals.  If journalists take wrong turnings in the most dangerous places on earth, nobody else should have to pay the price of saving us from the consequences of our ambitions and follies.        Print this article   Read later   Email to a friend   Share this article:   Facebook    Twitter    Digg it    Newsvine    Delicious    MySpace    Nowpublic    Reddit             Comments ( 13 )  Here's what readers have had to say so far.

The NYT is a liberal media mess that tries to discredit our military and their reporter should have been left to his own devices.

He is clearly an ignorant, arrogant fool and has cost three lives. Steven Farrell is a heavy burden the like of which the army would be better off without. He should spend the rest of his life on his knees praying for forgiveness - and should be kept out of war zones. - lorraine, herefordshire, 12/9/2009 01:44 Click to rate        Rating     19   Report abuse     The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.
