More than 500 people were found packed into two trucks in Mexico's southern most state. They were enduring unthinkable conditions to get to America. But they still had close to 1,000 miles to go.  The 513 migrants, hot, tired and dehydrated, were rounded up and processed for detention in Chiapas, Mexico, shortly after two trucks smuggling them across the border tried to blow past a security checkpoint.   Authorities were alerted to the human cargo by an amazingly detailed X-ray, showing people sittings, standing and jammed into the trucks.   The 240 people in one truck and 273 in the other were packed so tightly -- up to seven people per square yard -- that they could barely move or breathe.   World Watch Blog: More from CBS News producer Susana Seijas in Mexico  The temperatures inside topped 100 degrees. More alarming, they came from at least eight different countries: 410 from Guatemala, others as far away as India, Nepal and China - a smuggling pipeline run by gangs.   "We're talking about something that's far more systematic than people realize," says  Demetrios Papademetriou,  of the Migration Policy Institute. "They learned how to do this by trying to move drugs and other contraband.   After the Golden Venture, carrying 286 Chinese nationals, ran aground off New York 18 years ago, authorities have cracked down on human smuggling by sea, even by train. Their preferred mode of transportation now: trucks. Some migrants say they paid $7,000 each for a truck ride to the U.S. border. Though the price they end up paying the gangs is far higher.  "Through all sorts of activities that we really don't like - indentured servitude, prostitution," Papademetriou said.   Mexico authorities say they've intercepted almost 800 migrants entering the country illegally just this month. Border observers say that means many times that number made it through.     © 2011 CBS Interactive Inc..

Reply to this comment             by  1stlttightwad  May 19, 2011 8:34 AM EDT  We have no trespassing signs because of drug activity in Arizona warning American citizens to stay out. Too Dangerous. It's time to send the 82nd Airborne or the 10th Mountain division to the border and stop all this kerap. Don't comeback with a comment about militarizing the border...Mexico has their Navy already there..so stick it.

Reply to this comment             by  TomJohnn  May 19, 2011 2:59 AM EDT  If the US doesn't stop sending all its jobs overseas, these poor illegals won't find any jobs here they can steal! Reply to this comment             by  maiingan  May 18, 2011 11:25 PM EDT  If I had $7,000 to pay to get to some place to work, maybe I would be well advised to bribe an employer to hire me to do the work I'm supposed to be doing, instead of what I'm doing now. Actually, I'd pay off debts first, but it would be interesting to see if that would help many U.S. citizens here who are being excluded and discriminated against. But we must note that despite the many countries of origin, these would-be illegal aliens all tried to enter through Mexico. We have got to get control of our borders! Reply to this comment             by  cattiej  May 18, 2011 11:24 PM EDT  Obama with Dick Durbin at the helm are sponsoring the Dream Act. An act that Obama tried to pass in Illinois. The Act give children of illegals the right to go to a U.S. college or university at 1/2 or in many cases, no tuition. How can a college age person be considered a child when these people are probably at least 17 18 years old. Also, how many illegals work in the food industry..thousands..and most of them have diseases that may be harmful to YOUR health. Some of them probably have active TB..So, be careful where you eat. I hope all illegals are rounded up and deported and those business who hire them should be arrested and receive automatically 10 years in prison for every illegal they hire. These business's who hire illegal's are just like a home grown terriorits. Our country is in trouble and Obama wants to let illegals that are here already become citizens? No...No...No....We must all take a stand..I don't care what country you come from, if you are here illegally because you don't like the country you came from, go back home and work for a change in YOUR OWN GOVERNMENT..Our country is broke and one of the reasons is because of illegals and oursourceing.

And all the idiots are still scratching their heads...wondering why Arizona stared taking matters into their own hands. Reply to this comment             by  ti-grr  May 18, 2011 10:55 PM EDT  When no action is taken against Illegals already here, its an invitation to all others. Obama is too lame to take action. Three past presidents, after a war or recession, removed all the illegals here to create jobs for Americans and retuning soldiers. Will anyone in the corrupt Congress make a move to do the same???  And how many terrorists did Bushs let in? Remember it was Saudis on the hijacked planes, not Iraqis. And Bin Ladens brother is one who helped launch Bush Jrs oil businesses. The stench of past white house residents still pervades this country. Reply to this comment            by  mari1963  May 18, 2011 11:36 PM EDT  Amen to that! We have got to stop illegals from entering this country - period! And if it takes X raying of trucks to do it then so be it. The invitation to outsiders must stop! Get out and stay out!                    by  SusanMassachusetts  May 18, 2011 9:51 PM EDT  Far more sophisticated than they were aware of? Well WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE! The rest of us knew it was going on, where the heck have you morons been? Reply to this comment            by  AOCGUY  May 18, 2011 10:00 PM EDT  If you knew why weren't you there to stop it? Or at least to notify authorities? Haveing prior knowledge that a crime was about to be comitted and not reportinmg said crime to the authorities makes you guilty as well. Where the heck have you morons been?                  by  SusanMassachusetts  May 18, 2011 10:03 PM EDT  Aocguy- you are an idiot. I can not take you seriously when you can not construct a sentence properly and can not spell the majority of the words correctly.                    by  snaptrap1-2009  May 18, 2011 8:31 PM EDT  they need to stop,open, and check each truck that comes thur before it enters this country until this stops, no matter how big the backups gets at the boarder...
