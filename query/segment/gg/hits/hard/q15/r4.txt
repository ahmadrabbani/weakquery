However, unemployment remains high and outdated infrastructure has constrained growth.     Daunting economic problems remain from the apartheid era - especially poverty, lack of economic empowerment among the disadvantaged groups, and a shortage of public transportation. South African economic policy is fiscally conservative but pragmatic, focusing on controlling inflation, maintaining a budget surplus, and using state-owned enterprises to deliver basic services to low-income areas as a means to increase job growth and household income  .    [ The World  Factbook ,   U.S.C.I.A. 2009]              South Africa is a source, transit, and destination country for trafficked men, women, and children. Children are largely trafficked within the country from poor rural areas to urban centers like Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, and Bloemfontein – girls trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude; boys trafficked for forced street vending, food service, begging, crime, and agriculture; and both boys and girls trafficked for “ muti ” (the removal of their organs for traditional medicine). The tradition of “ ukuthewala ,” the forced marriage of girls as young as 12 to adult men, is still practiced in remote villages in the Eastern Cape.     -    U.S.    State Dept Trafficking in Persons Report, June, 2009      [ full country report ]                 CAUTION:       The following links have been culled from the web to illuminate the situation in   South Africa  .    Some of these links may lead to websites that present allegations that are unsubstantiated or even false.    No attempt has been made to validate their authenticity or to verify their content.     *** FEATURED ARTICLES ***         Caught In Traffic           Show: Carte Blanche, Producer: First Edit, Date: 28 January 2007        beta.mnet.co.za/carteblanche/Article.aspx?Id =3239       [accessed 23 December 2010]     Every month thousands of children are smuggled by greedy opportunists and syndicates across our international and provincial borders.

A substantial number of persons were believed to be trafficked annually. Domestic and international organized crime syndicates trafficked women into the country for the sex industry. Young men were generally trafficked for agricultural work.     The extent of trafficking operations was unknown, but the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported there were 12 major routes for trafficking operations, including Southern Africa, Asia, and  Eastern Europe .     Trafficked women and children who worked in the sex industry often lived with other trafficked victims in segregated areas; were frequently under constant surveillance; usually had no money or identifying documents; were often indebted to the agents who arranged their travel; often worked long hours, in some cases up to 18 hours each day, on weekends, and when ill; and sometimes were fined by their trafficker for infractions of strict rules. Young men trafficked for forced agricultural labor often were subjected to violence and food rationing.     In most cases traffickers lured women with promises of employment, marriage, or educational opportunities abroad. Traffickers often lured the children of poor families with promises of jobs, education, or a better way of life. Victims, who could be kidnapped or forced to follow their traffickers, were subjected to threats of violence, withholding of documents, and debt bondage to ensure compliance.

The Committee is also concerned at the inadequate legislation, policies and institutions to regulate inter-country adoptions.    [40] The Committee notes the efforts of the State party to address the situation of the sale, trafficking and abduction of children, including the adoption of the Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, into domestic legislation. However, the Committee is concerned about the increasing incidence of sale and trafficking of children, particularly girls, and the lack of adequate measures to enforce legislative guarantees and to prevent and combat this phenomenon.

FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS: Right to Basic Education for Children on Farms in   South Africa         Human Rights Watch, 2 JUNE 2004       www.hrw.org/en/reports/2004/06/02/forgotten-schools       [accessed 23 December 2010]     The government faces enormous challenges in attempting to protect the rights of those living in remote rural areas, particularly the right of children living on commercial farms to education.  The present government has inherited a situation where a child may have to endure long journeys on foot, be unable to meet schools fees or pay for a school uniform.  All these needs create a burden on the child and parent(s).    The South African government has inherited an education system in rural areas based on racial, social and economic inequalities.  Through the 1996 constitution and the ratification of international human rights law pertaining to children’s rights to education, the government is obliged to protect the right to an education.  Children living on farms have the right to receive an education freely and in an environment conducive to learning.      South Africa        : Caution urged over new human trafficking laws       U.N. Integrated Regional Information Networks IRIN,   Johannesburg  , 19 October 2004       www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=51758       [accessed 23 December 2010]     EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM NOT KNOWN  - According to the Geneva-based International Organisation for Migration (IOM),  South Africa is the regional centre of an intricate trafficking network that recruits women and children from  Mozambique ,  Angola ,  Malawi ,  Eastern Europe ,  Thailand and   China  .    However, Ted Leggett, a researcher with the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), recently questioned the benefit of promulgating new anti-trafficking legislation.    In an ISS article titled, 'The Risks of Human Trafficking Legislation', Leggett argued that the extent of trafficking in   South Africa  was unclear. The South African Law Reform Commission (SALRC), which is investigating the proposed legislation, "draws its ideas about the extent and nature of the local [trafficking] problem almost entirely from two pieces of primary research ... [which] are hinged on the direct experiences of less than 35 people", Leggett pointed out.    Although both pieces of work "profess to be preliminary investigations, in the absence of other research they are being taken as authoritative".    Commenting on the unverified need for additional legislation, Leggett noted that "the bottom line is that virtually everything that is part of trafficking is already illegal, and simply generating more legislation is unlikely to  revolutionise the situation". He suggested that "no policy decision should be taken in this area without further research".      Sexual abuse of young children in southern Africa         Higson   -Smith, C. & Richter, L. (2004) Commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking of children. In Sexual abuse of young children in southern Africa,   Cape Town  : HSRC Press. 143-175    At one time this article had been archived and may possibly still be accessible [ here ]    [accessed 11 September 2011]    In this chapter the authors argue that both commercial sexual exploitation if children and trafficking in children are significant and growing problems in southern  Africa . Although sex tourism is one aspect of this problem, the underlying causes of the sexual exploitation of children are firmly embedded in social inequalities, corruption, gender discrimination, cheap labour practices and poor educational opportunities. Worsening poverty among especially vulnerable families and communities affected by HIV/AIDS, and the increasing adult mortality associated with AIDS-illness, are creating, potentially very dangerous situation for children. Under these conditions, children prematurely engage in livelihood activities, most in demand and lucrative if which is sex.      38 000 child prostitutes in SA       South African Press Association SAPA,   Pretoria  , 11 May 2004       www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/38-000-child-prostitutes-in-SA-20040511       [accessed 23 December 2010]     South Africa   is a major destination and source for international trafficking of children, a conference on human trafficking heard in   Pretoria  on Tuesday.    Susan  Kreston of the Council of the National Centre for Justice and the Rule of Law in the  USA told the conference - arranged by the Institute for Security Studies - that between 28 000 and 38 000 children were currently being prostituted in   South Africa  .    "Up to 25% of prostitutes in   South Africa  are children, and up to 25% of street children (are prostitutes)," she told the conference.      Human Trafficking Stretches Across the Region        Moyiga      Nduru , Inter Press Service News Agency IPS,    Benoni  ,  South Africa  , June 23       www.ipsnews.net/africa/interna.asp?idnews=24338       [accessed 23 December 2010]     IOM official Jonathan Martens told a three-day conference which opened in  Benoni , near South Africa's main commercial city of Johannesburg, this week (Jun. 22) that the women are promised employment, luxury accommodation, and a payment of between 10,000 and 20,000 dollars. Their passports are confiscated once they arrive in  Macau .     Martens said South African traffickers earn around 500 dollars for every woman recruited for prostitution in  Macau , which has been labeled the "Las Vegas of Asia" for its numerous casinos and nightclubs. Drugs play a "very big role" in recruitment, he added.     A 23-year-old woman identified as Nicola reported to the IOM that she had met nine other black, white and mixed race South Africans aged 18 to 21 in  Macau , who were forcibly prostituted in the former colony.      South Africa        regional centre for human trafficking       U.N. Integrated Regional Information Networks IRIN,   Johannesburg  , 23 June 2004       www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=50363       [accessed 23 December 2010]     Mozambican women are recruited either through a "passive" or an "active" method by  organised groups or minibus-taxi operators. The passive method targets female passengers already en route to   South Africa  . In the active method, traffickers offer women jobs as waitresses or sex workers in  Johannesburg and charge R500 ($80) to smuggle them from the Mozambican capital,  Maputo , through the  Komatipoort or  Ponta do  Ouro border posts to   South Africa  .    "The women stay in transit houses along  South Africa 's border with  Mozambique and   Swaziland  for a night, where they are sexually assaulted as an initiation. They are then smuggled into Johannesburg and are kept in safe houses in Soweto and  Lenasia until they are sold to brothels in  Gauteng or  KwaZulu -Natal for R1,000 (about $160)," Martens said. The women are also sold as wives to South African men for R650 (about $104).      Initiative to fight human trafficking to be launched           U.N. Integrated Regional Information Networks IRIN,   Johannesburg  , 18 Jun 2004       archive.wn.com/2004/06/20/1400/p/98/d8784aa23ab6b0.html       [accessed 23 December 2010]     An initiative to build collaboration between government and NGOs to fight human trafficking will be launched at a conference in   South Africa  next week, according to the activist body, War Against Trafficking Alliance.     The  Johannesburg conference beginning on 22 June will help put together a newly constituted national task team's agenda on combating human trafficking and is the fifth follow-up of a world summit held in   Washington  last year.     The global coalition will also release video footage documenting sex tourism in   South Africa  . "Leaders in the anti-trafficking movement must strive for balance in their efforts to provide long-term service provision and successful prosecution, conviction and sentencing for those who prey on the vulnerable," said founder of the coalition, Linda Smith. "I believe this video will shock participants and sustain the good efforts being made to put these predators behind bars."      SOUTHERN AFRICA       : Major destination for traffickers in women and children           U.N. Integrated Regional Information Networks IRIN,   Johannesburg  , 23 April 2004       www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=49630       [accessed 23 December 2010]     The women and children are either sexually exploited, used as labour or their organs are harvested.    While poverty has been  recognised as the most "visible cause for trafficking human beings ... another strong determinant is the particular vulnerability of women and children, which makes them an easy target for traffickers". Patterns of oppression, discrimination, social and cultural prejudices, and the prevalence of gender violence put children and women at greater risk and ensures the flourishing of the trafficking trade.      Southern Africa       : Conference On Human Trafficking Opens           U.N. Integrated Regional Information Networks IRIN,   Johannesburg  , 22 June 2004       www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=50347       [accessed 23 December 2010]     "I am young - but up here is old," says an 11-year-old girl working as a prostitute in Cape Town, pointing to her head - one of many images in hard-hitting footage on the sex industry, screened at the opening of a conference on human trafficking in South Africa on Tuesday.    A pimp in Cape Town, South Africa's tourism capital, who supplies eight- to 11-year-olds to sex tourists mainly from the US, Britain and Japan, commented in the film that children are sometimes tied with barbed wire and told to perform sexual acts on adults.     The footage was shot by the global coalition of NGOs. According to the South Africa-based child rights' activist  organisation ,  Molo  Songololo , 25 percent of prostitutes in   Cape Town  are children.     While the film alleged that child prostitution in  Cape Town was run predominantly by a Nigerian syndicate, Smith said Russian, Bulgarian and Chinese crime groups were other major players in the human trafficking business in   South Africa  .     The country's attractive  First World conditions - "clean water, good schools for their children" - were luring trafficking traders to the country, said Smith.      40 000 child prostitutes - Street children vulnerable to sex trade       A.  Bolowana , 2004      www.themercury.co.za/index.php?fSectionId   =283&fArticleId=2198903       [access date unavailable]     About 40 000 children in South Africa are involved in child prostitution and the figures are rising as more and more children are driven from their homes because of poverty, neglect and abuse.    The child prostitutes - all under the age of 18 - are among 400 000 child  labourers in the country, according to the Network Against Child Labour.    Once on the streets, children are vulnerable to a booming sex trade and trafficking.       Seduction, Sale & Slavery: Trafficking In Women & Children For Sexual Exploitation In  Southern Africa              [PDF]        Jonathan Martens,  Maciej ‘Mac’  Pieczkowski , Bernadette van  Vuuren -Smyth, International Organization for Migration (IOM) Regional Office for Southern Africa,   Pretoria ,  South Africa  , May 2003     www.iom.org.za/site/media/docs/TraffickingReport3rdEd.pdf     [accessed 11 September 2011]    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  - The major findings may be summarized as follows:    Refugees are both victims and perpetrators of trafficking to   South Africa  . As male refugees encounter unemployment and xenophobia in  South Africa , some choose to recruit female relatives from their countries of origin to   South Africa  . These women are usually 25 years and older, married and have children. Individual refugee traffickers are assisted by ethnically-based syndicates in delivering a recruiting letter to the victim in her country of origin, escorting her to   South Africa  , and sexually assaulting her as an initiation to sex work should she resist upon arrival. The refugee trafficker takes the earnings the woman receives as a sex worker and, to protect his investment, he assists her in applying for refugee status to prevent deportation if police detain her.
