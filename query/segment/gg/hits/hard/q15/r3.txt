Florida Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking Florida is the second largest hub of human trafficking in the U.S. However, since 1996 only 14 cases of human trafficking have actually been brought to federal court. One of these successful cases was U.S. vs. Baldonado, which required cross-agency collaboration. On May 20, 2008, 52 year old Haitian National and Miami school teacher Maude Paulin and her husband Saintfort were both found guilty of smuggling and harboring a young Haitian girl, using her as a household servant in their south Florida home between 1999 and 2005. When convicted, Maude Paulins faced a prison term of 87 months, Saintfort faced 18 months and jointly, over $167,000 in restitution was ordered to be paid to the victim. In many areas of Florida, task forces and working groups have been formed to provide trainings and address human trafficking issues in the state.

Federal Government Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking In July, 2004, The Bush Administration took new steps to combat human trafficking. The plan included more funding, better coordination, and tighter laws, including comprehensive anti-trafficking state laws. The Department of Justice drafted a model anti-trafficking statute for states in an effort to foster comprehensive and uniform anti-trafficking statutes throughout the United States. In a fact sheet released July 16, 2004, the White House announced new initiatives the Bush administration is undertaking to combat human trafficking. These included:  Support for Local Anti-Trafficking Efforts in American Communities. The President announced the allocation of Department of Justice funding to support and implement local efforts to identify, rescue and restore victims of trafficking.  Cooperation to Combat Trafficking. The Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security and Justice will improve their coordination to better share information and provide benefits to victims most in need. In addition, the charter for the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center, which took effect in July, brings together representatives from law enforcement, intelligence and diplomacy to combat alien smuggling, trafficking in persons and terrorist travel networks.  Comprehensive Anti-Trafficking State Laws. The Department of Justice has drafted a model anti-trafficking statue for states in an effort to foster comprehensive anti-trafficking statutes throughout the United States.   Trafficking is a transnational criminal enterprise. It recognizes neither boundaries nor borders. Profits from trafficking feed into the coffers of organized crime. Trafficking is fueled by other criminal activities such as visa and document fraud, labor contracting, money laundering and migrant smuggling. Because trafficking cases are so expansive in reach, they are among the most important matters - as well as the most labor and time-intensive matters - undertaken by the Department of Justice." (Remarks of Attorney General John Ashcroft, 2/25/03) It is a high priority of the Department of Justice to pursue and prosecute human traffickers. Human trafficking frequently involves the trafficking of women and children for sexual exploitation, a brutal crime the Department is committed to aggressively investigate and prosecute. Trafficking also often involves exploitation of agricultural and sweat shop workers, as well as individuals working as domestic servants.
