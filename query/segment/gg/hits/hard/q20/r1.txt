  ATHENS (Dow Jones)--Greece's opposition New Democracy party is facing internal dissent over a demand by the European Union that it co-sign a letter committing it to implementing a new EUR130 billion bailout for the country, a senior party official said Tuesday.  The opposition, which is currently in talks with Greece's Socialist government on forming an interim government, has consistently opposed the austerity measures the Socialists have taken to win new fresh aid from Europe.  Earlier Tuesday, New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras gave his verbal support for the latest aid package but hinted he wouldn't sign such a letter--possibly throwing a fresh wrench in talks on a coalition government.  "Samaras is facing divisions within the party because a lot of senior party members feel that he is giving too much ground," the official said. "So a number of people are refusing to be part of the new government."  On Monday, euro-zone finance ministers met in Brussels to discuss Greece's aid package and decide on whether to disburse their portion of an EUR8 billion aid tranche promised to the country under a previous bailout.  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the euro-zone finance ministers group, made clear he expected Greek political leaders to make explicit--and in writing--their commitment to implementing the details of the October aid plan.  At a Greek cabinet meeting earlier Tuesday, Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said that such a written commitment would have to include signatures from both the government and the opposition, if it was to be accepted by the euro group.  According to officials present in the meeting, Venizelos said that a letter would have to include signatures from Samaras, Prime Minister George Papandreou, Greece's central bank governor, the finance minister and the new, interim prime minister.   -By Costas Paris and Alkman Granitsas, Dow Jones Newswires; +30 210 331 2881; alkman.granitsas@dowjones.com        Email   Printer Friendly   Order Reprints    Share:  facebook      Twitter      LinkedIn      StumbleUpon      Viadeo      Orkut      Fark      Reddit      del.icio.us      MySpace               Editors' Picks   Frazier, Champion Boxer, Dies      Jackson's Doctor Convicted    Subscriber Content  Read Preview       Top Obama Aide Cedes Day-to-Day Role    Subscriber Content  Read Preview       Clinton Urges New Science in AIDS Push      It's Time to Embrace Off-Broadway Joe        WSJ Web Slice CONTENT LINKS TO ACTUAL PAGE CONTAINING WEB SLICE FUNCTIONALITY.    15  back to top     WSJ.com Account: My Account   Create an Account: Register for Limited Access  Subscribe to WSJ.com  Sign up for WSJ Professional   Help & Information Center: Help  Customer Service  Contact Us  Global Support  New on WSJ.com  Take a Tour  Print Subscriber Services    About: News Licensing  Reprints  Advertising  Classifieds  Advertise Locally  Conferences  About Dow Jones  Privacy Policy - UPDATED 10/18/2011  Your Ad Choices  Subscriber Agreement & Terms of Use - Updated  Copyright Policy  Jobs at WSJ.com  Future Leadership Program    WSJ.com: Site Map  Home  World  U.S.  New York  Business  Markets  Market Data  Tech  Personal Finance  Life & Culture  Opinion  Autos  Careers  Real Estate  Small Business  Student Journal  Corrections  SafeHouse - Send Us Information    Tools & Formats: Today's Paper  Video Center  Graphics  Columns  Blogs  Topics  Guides  Alerts  Newsletters  Mobile  Tablet Edition  Podcasts  RSS Feeds  Journal Community - Message Center    WSJ on Twitter  WSJ on Facebook  WSJ on Foursquare  My Journal  Portfolio  WSJ Digital Downloads       Digital Network  WSJ.com  Marketwatch.com  Barrons.com  SmartMoney.com  AllThingsD.com  FINS:  Finance,  IT jobs,  Sales jobs  BigCharts.com  Virtual Stock Exchange  WSJ Radio  Professor Journal  WSJ U.S. Edition  WSJ Asia Edition  WSJ Europe Edition  WSJ India Page  Foreign language editions:  WSJ Chinese  WSJ Japanese  WSJ Portuguese  WSJ Spanish       ACAP Enabled    Copyright ©2011 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
