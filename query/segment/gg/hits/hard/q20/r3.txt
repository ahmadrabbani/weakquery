 Now the euro-elite move to gag national opposition parties - Mail Online - M E Synon's blog

   « It stinks: EU to install puppet governments in Athens and Rome |  Main |  And let that be a lesson to the new Greek government »  08 November 2011 10:43 AM Now the euro-elite move to gag national opposition parties  First question out of the press pack after last night's meeting of eurozone finance ministers was about the EU interference in national politics -- the way the euro-elite are insisting, for example, that the new Greek government must be a government of national unity: surely that degree of interference is out of order?  Not at all, came back the answer. According to both Jean-Claude Juncker, prime minister of     Luxembourg (that's him pictured) and head of the eurogroup, and Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner in charge of the bail-outs, it is not at least out of order.  According to Rehn, all the eurozone member states in the 'programmes' -- that is, taking the bail-outs and submitting to control by EU/ECB/IMF bureaucrats, and those are Ireland, Portugal and Greece so far (stand by for the big one, Italy) -- have governments of national unity.  Which was a bit of a press-pack stunner for a moment, until a journalist said the obvious, which was: 'No they don't. For a start, Ireland does not have a government of national unity.'  Note of explanation for American readers: a government of national unity is one in which the opposition officially joins the majority party or parties to form a grand coalition, thereby guaranteeing a parliamentary majority.  It is what the euro-elite are forcing on Greece -- not that the euro-elite have asked the Greek voters, who cares what they think? Shut-up, Stavros, and do what you're told -- more, Juncker and Rehn insisted last night that the new government of national unity, the moment it is formed, must sign a letter promising to accept the entire rescue (some rescue) deal agreed last month at the summit, otherwise no money will be paid over, not even the amounts already agreed under the earlier, second bailout.  But this wasn't forced on Ireland or Portugal. So what were Juncker and Rehn on about?  This: they insist before any EU/ECB/IMF money is paid, they must have assurances that there is 'national unity' on accepting bail-out conditions -- which is to say, accepting EU-control of the national budgets -- before any money will be paid. Rehn insisted that the Irish opposition agreed to support the bail-out, so that was 'national unity' -- and they would not have paid over the money if they had not had such agreement from the Opposition.  Some unity: achieved by threat and blackmail.  The reason for this, of course, is that a real opposition would have the duty -- indeed, the desire -- to criticise the so-called bail-outs and all the damage the things are doing to the Irish, the Portuguese and the Greek people. Any opposition with a brain could offer other programmes, other ways of getting out of the debt hole into which the euro has pushed these nations (and will keep these nations for the next ten years).  These other programmes might not -- almost certainly would not -- include handing control of national fiscal policy, national economics, industrial policy, national assets sales and all the rest of the powers of a once-sovereign state over to the unelected euro-elite. Other programmes would not include, as in Greece, cutting public service pay by 20 to 30 percent while slamming up taxes to the same degree at the same moment: that is just the butchery of the little people in pursuit of ideology.  So the opposition parties are threatened or frighten into agreeing to back the Brussels deal: we will not oppose, we will cooperate, we will collaborate, we will stay silent, we will submit.  And then the people of these nations will be left with no leaders other than the governments put in place by the euro-elite, will be told by both sides of their parliament to believe that there is only the one way, only the one programme, all to support the one country called Europe...and you may recognise what is happening now across the eurozone:     'The whole climate of thought will be different. In fact, there will be no thought, as we understand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking -- not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconciousness.'        November 8, 2011 |  Permalink |  Comments (4)  Share this article:  Digg it  Del.icio.us  Reddit  Newsvine  Nowpublic  StumbleUpon  Facebook  MySpace  Fark      Comments   You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the  comment feed for this post.   What is truly worrying is that we have governments colluding with the Franco German Alliance who now control the EU. In the case of the British government they are nothing but quislings and fifth columnists having run down our defence forces and allowing uncontrolled mass immigration.

Posted by: Paul |  08/11/2011 at 01:31 PM    Some would say this is fiction if you read it in a book. This is fact and is occuring all over Europe. In fact it is truly frightening what unelected people are doing.   Posted by: Sean Ex-Pat Romania |  08/11/2011 at 12:46 PM    Italy is too big a fish for the EU leviathan to swallow. The markets know this. Soon so will everybody else.
