So the price you just found out for your favourite petrol station "around the corner" might have changed by the time you arrive there. More important in our point of view: The   current price level  (price fixing). Another relevant indicator:   The companies' price level   that accounts for apparent differences in prices. As proved by the statistics the companies' share (red bars) is relatively low compared to the all-round price. The price adjustment largely depends on this price range: the blue bars represent fixed values derived from crude oil price, US dollar exchange rate and taxation. Our statistical evaluation shows that price increases are commonly applied much faster than price reductions due to reduced purchase prices.  Our   petrol price forecast  calculates the pricing pressure caused by varying purchase prices including differences, such as regions and companies, combining those with former records of companies' economic behaviour e.g. increasing / decreasing prices on effective dates such as weekends and holidays. Obviously our system is currently inadequate to provide secure predictions of purchase prices (largely dependant on US dollar exchange rate / crude oil price), in other words: sudden changes will, of course, have a severe impact on charged prices.
