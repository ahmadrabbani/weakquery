In 1999, Hoffmann-La Roche and BASF paid $500 million and $250 million, respectively, for fixing vitamin prices. In 1997, Archer Daniels Midland paid a $100 million fine for fixing lysine and citric acid, and Bayer paid $50 million for fixing citric acid.                                    Table of Contents            C&EN Classifieds            News of the Week            Cover Story            Editor's Page            Business            Government & Policy            Science/Technology           Concentrates             Business              Government & Policy              Science/Technology            Education            ACS News            Calendars            Books            Digital Briefs            ACS Comments            Career & Employment            Special Reports            Letters            Awards            New Products            Newscripts            Nanotechnology            What's That Stuff?            Pharmaceutical Century           Hot Articles        Safety  Letters        Chemcyclopedia            Back Issues  2001  2000  1999  1998           How to Subscribe       Subscription Changes       About C&EN       Copyright Permission       E-mail webmaster        NEWS OF THE WEEK        BUSINESS         June 11,            2001            Volume 79, Number 24 CENEAR 79 24 pp. 6 ISSN 0009-2347     [Previous Story]  [Next Story]   PAINT PRICE-FIXING PROBE UNDER WAY   Anticompetitive practices are subject of Justice Department inquiry    MARC REISCH  In one broad brush stroke, the  Department of Justice has subpoenaed five major automobile refinish paint makers for documents that could show evidence of anticompetitive practices.        COLLISION WITH JUSTICE     P  rice-fixing among auto paint makers might have made it more expensive to get cars repainted.          Details of the grand jury investigation under way are sketchy. A Justice spokeswoman would say only that "the Antitrust Division is looking at possible anticompetitive practices in the auto-refinish industry."  But  BASF ,  PPG ,  DuPont ,  Akzo Nobel , and  Sherwin-Williams acknowledge that they have received requests for information on their auto paint refinish businesses. Together, they supply $1.2 billion in coatings annually to 1,300 U.S. auto-body repair shops, says Pinehurst, N.C.-based industry consultant Phil Phillips.  All the paint makers say they are cooperating with the Justice Department. However, publicly available documents suggest that Akzo is key to the inquiry.  The Dutch company's annual report states that last year it incurred $26 million in legal and settlement costs because of paint-refinish antitrust violations. And it reveals that the company has set aside $145 million to pay, over the next few years, "probable costs, fines, and civil damages" resulting from its behavior.  Akzo also discloses that this investigation has legs. Canadian and European Union investigators are looking into allegations of price-fixing among auto paint refinish suppliers.   On the U.S. investigation, an Akzo spokesman says the company is cooperating, but "it is company policy not to comment further on pending government investigations."  A PPG spokesman says his company received a subpoena for documents in January. As it complied with the Justice request, PPG did its own internal investigation and found that "no one did anything improper."  A BASF spokesman also says, "We have no reason to believe we violated any laws." DuPont says pretty much the same and adds in its statement, "We are not at liberty to comment further ... but we do not expect that it will affect our normal business activities."  A Sherwin-Williams spokesman says the company is cooperating with authorities and "is unaware of any improprieties."
