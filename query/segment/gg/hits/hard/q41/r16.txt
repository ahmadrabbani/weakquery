The case has broad implications because its outcome could impact the price of memory chips, a key component in notebooks, PCs and other devices. Attorneys for Rambus, which creates and licenses new memory-chip designs but doesn't make chips itself, had argued that South Korea's Hynix and  Micron ( MU ), the No. 1 U.S.-based memory-chip maker, colluded to fix memory-chip prices to prevent Rambus' technology from becoming the industry standard. Micron and Hynix countered that Rambus' chip technology was beset by technical glitches and that the company was blaming others for its failures. If Rambus had won, it could have dramatically boosted the company's worth, valued at about $2 billion in the stock market before Wednesday's verdict. It could also have resulted in Hynix and Micron having to increase the price of their chips to pay Rambus. The verdict in the three-month California Superior Court trial in San Francisco came after more than eight weeks of jury deliberation. Trading in Rambus and Micron shares was temporarily halted prior to the the announcement of the verdict. Micron shares jumped 23%.       Avg.
