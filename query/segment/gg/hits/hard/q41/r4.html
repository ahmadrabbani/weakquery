      the most common antitrust violations and outlines those conditions and 
      events that indicate anticompetitive collusion. </FONT>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Introduction</B><a href="#1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">American consumers have the 
      right to expect the benefits of free and open competition — the best goods 
      and services at the lowest prices. Public and private organizations often 
      rely on a competitive bidding process to achieve that end. The competitive 
      process only works, however, when competitors set prices honestly and 
      independently. When competitors collude, prices are inflated and the 
      customer is cheated. Price fixing, bid rigging, and other forms of 
      collusion are illegal and are subject to criminal prosecution by the 
      Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In recent years, the 
      Antitrust Division has successfully prosecuted regional, national, and 
      international conspiracies affecting construction, agricultural products, 
      manufacturing, service industries, consumer products, and many other 
      sectors of our economy. Many of these prosecutions resulted from 
      information uncovered by members of the general public who reported the 
      information to the Antitrust Division. Working together, we can continue 
      the effort to protect and promote free and open competition in the 
      marketplaces of America. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This primer contains an 
      overview of the federal antitrust laws and the penalties that may be 
      imposed for their violation. It briefly describes the most common 
      antitrust violations and outlines those conditions and events that 
      indicate anticompetitive collusion so that you might better identify and 
      report suspicious activity. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Federal Antitrust 
      Enforcement</B> </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Enacted in 1890, the Sherman 
      Act is among our country's most important and enduring pieces of economic 
      legislation. The Sherman Act prohibits any agreement among competitors to 
      fix prices, rig bids, or engage in other anticompetitive activity. 
      Criminal prosecution of Sherman Act violations is the responsibility of 
      the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Violation of the Sherman Act 
      is a felony punishable by a fine of up to $10 million for corporations, 
      and a fine of up to $350,000 or 3 years imprisonment (or both) for 
      individuals, if the offense was committed before June 22, 2004. If the offense was committed on or after June 22, 2004, the maximum Sherman Act fine is $100 million for corporations and $1 million for individuals, and the maximum Sherman Act jail sentence is 10 years. Under some circumstances, the maximum potential fine may be increased above the Sherman Act maximums to twice the gain or loss involved. In addition, collusion among competitors may constitute 
      violations of the mail or wire fraud statute, the false statements 
      statute, or other federal felony statutes, all of which the Antitrust 
      Division prosecutes. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to receiving a 
      criminal sentence, a corporation or individual convicted of a Sherman Act 
      violation may be ordered to make restitution to the victims for all 
      overcharges. Victims of bid-rigging and price-fixing conspiracies also may 
      seek civil recovery of up to three times the amount of damages suffered. 
      </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Forms of Collusion</B> 
      </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most criminal antitrust 
      prosecutions involve price fixing, bid rigging, or market division or 
      allocation schemes. Each of these forms of collusion may be prosecuted 
      criminally if they occurred, at least in part, within the past five years. 
      Proving such a crime does not require us to show that the conspirators 
      entered into a formal written or express agreement. Price fixing, bid 
      rigging, and other collusive agreements can be established either by 
      direct evidence, such as the testimony of a participant, or by 
      circumstantial evidence, such as suspicious bid patterns, travel and 
      expense reports, telephone records, and business diary entries. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under the law, price-fixing 
      and bid-rigging schemes are per se violations of the Sherman Act. This 
      means that where such a collusive scheme has been established, it cannot 
      be justified under the law by arguments or evidence that, for example, the 
      agreed-upon prices were reasonable, the agreement was necessary to prevent 
      or eliminate price cutting or ruinous competition, or the conspirators 
      were merely trying to make sure that each got a fair share of the market. 
      </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><I>Price Fixing</I></B> 
      </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Price fixing is an agreement 
      among competitors to raise, fix, or otherwise maintain the price at which 
      their goods or services are sold. It is not necessary that the competitors 
      agree to charge exactly the same price, or that every competitor in a 
      given industry join the conspiracy. Price fixing can take many forms, and 
      any agreement that restricts price competition violates the law. Other 
      examples of price-fixing agreements include those to: </FONT>

        </FONT></P>

        </FONT></LI></UL>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In many cases, participants 
      in a price-fixing conspiracy also establish some type of policing 
      mechanism to make sure that everyone adheres to the agreement. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><I>Bid Rigging</I></B> 
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bid rigging is the way that 
      conspiring competitors effectively raise prices where purchasers — often 
      federal, state, or local governments — acquire goods or services by 
      soliciting competing bids. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Essentially, competitors 
      agree in advance who will submit the winning bid on a contract being let 
      through the competitive bidding process. As with price fixing, it is not 
      necessary that all bidders participate in the conspiracy. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bid rigging also takes many 
      forms, but bid-rigging conspiracies usually fall into one or more of the 
      following categories: </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Bid Suppression</B>: In 
      bid suppression schemes, one or more competitors who otherwise would be 
      expected to bid, or who have previously bid, agree to refrain from bidding 
      or withdraw a previously submitted bid so that the designated winning 
      competitor's bid will be accepted. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Complementary Bidding:</B> 
      Complementary bidding (also known as "cover" or "courtesy" bidding) occurs 
      when some competitors agree to submit bids that either are too high to be 
      accepted or contain special terms that will not be acceptable to the 
      buyer. Such bids are not intended to secure the buyer's acceptance, but 
      are merely designed to give the appearance of genuine competitive bidding. 
      Complementary bidding schemes are the most frequently occurring forms of 
      bid rigging, and they defraud purchasers by creating the appearance of 
      competition to conceal secretly inflated prices. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Bid Rotation:</B><I> 
      </I>In bid rotation schemes, all conspirators submit bids but take turns 
      being the low bidder. The terms of the rotation may vary; for example, 
      competitors may take turns on contracts according to the size of the 
      contract, allocating equal amounts to each conspirator or allocating 
      volumes that correspond to the size of each conspirator company. A strict 
      bid rotation pattern defies the law of chance and suggests collusion is 
      taking place. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Subcontracting:</B> 
      Subcontracting arrangements are often part of a bid-rigging scheme. 
      Competitors who agree not to bid or to submit a losing bid frequently 
      receive subcontracts or supply contracts in exchange from the successful 
      low bidder. In some schemes, a low bidder will agree to withdraw its bid 
      in favor of the next low bidder in exchange for a lucrative subcontract 
      that divides the illegally obtained higher price between them. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Almost all forms of 
      bid-rigging schemes have one thing in common: an agreement among some or 
      all of the bidders which predetermines the winning bidder and limits or 
      eliminates competition among the conspiring vendors. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><I>Market Division 
      </I></B></FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Market division or allocation 
      schemes are agreements in which competitors divide markets among 
      themselves. In such schemes, competing firms allocate specific customers 
      or types of customers, products, or territories among themselves. For 
      example, one competitor will be allowed to sell to, or bid on contracts 
      let by, certain customers or types of customers. In return, he or she will 
      not sell to, or bid on contracts let by, customers allocated to the other 
      competitors. In other schemes, competitors agree to sell only to customers 
      in certain geographic areas and refuse to sell to, or quote intentionally 
      high prices to, customers in geographic areas allocated to conspirator 
      companies. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Detecting Bid Rigging, 
      Price Fixing, And Other Types Of Collusion</B> </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bid rigging, price fixing, 
      and other collusion can be very difficult to detect. Collusive agreements 
      are usually reached in secret, with only the participants having knowledge 
      of the scheme. However, suspicions may be aroused by unusual bidding or 
      pricing patterns or something a vendor says or does. </FONT>

      Patterns</I></B> </FONT>

      Indicators of Collusion</I></B> </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While these indicators may 
      arouse suspicion of collusion, they are not proof of collusion. For 
      example, bids that come in well above the estimate may indicate collusion 
      or simply an incorrect estimate. Also, a bidder can lawfully submit an 
      intentionally high bid that it does not think will be successful for its 
      own independent business reasons, such as being too busy to handle the 
      work but wanting to stay on the bidders' list. Only when a company submits 
      an intentionally high bid because of an agreement with a competitor does 
      an antitrust violation exist. Thus, indicators of collusion merely call 
      for further investigation to determine whether collusion exists or whether 
      there is an innocent explanation for the events in question. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Conditions Favorable To 
      Collusion</B> </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While collusion can occur in 
      almost any industry, it is more likely to occur in some industries than in 
      others. An indicator of collusion may be more meaningful when industry 
      conditions are already favorable to collusion. </FONT>
      <UL>
        <LI>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Collusion is more likely to 
        occur if there are few sellers. The fewer the number of sellers, the 
        easier it is for them to get together and agree on prices, bids, 
        customers, or territories. Collusion may also occur when the number of 
        firms is fairly large, but there is a small group of major sellers and 
        the rest are "fringe" sellers who control only a small fraction of the 
        market. </FONT></P>
        <LI>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The probability of 
        collusion increases if other products cannot easily be substituted for 
        the product in question or if there are restrictive specifications for 
        the product being procured. </FONT></P>
        <LI>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The more standardized a 
        product is, the easier it is for competing firms to reach agreement on a 
        common price structure. It is much harder to agree on other forms of 
        competition, such as design, features, quality, or service. </FONT></P>
        <LI>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Repetitive purchases may 
        increase the chance of collusion, as the vendors may become familiar
