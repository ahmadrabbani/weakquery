We provide applications across a broad range of areas, including oceanographic,  military & national security.  Our HMP vessels are superior investments, particularly due to the substantial cost savings, environmentally sensitive footprint & long lasting durability. We partner with other world leaders in the areas of naval architecture, research, engineering & construction to assure your project the best results.   Unmanned Ocean Vehicles    Autonomous, self-propelled, high endurance unmanned vessels   Existing unmanned marine vehicles use fuel or batteries, and have limited endurance. Persistent surveillance of vast ocean areas requires high endurance platforms with plenty of electrical power for electronic systems. They must be low cost so it is affordable to deploy them in sufficient numbers. They must be rugged and reliable to weather extreme ocean conditions.  UOV's adapt the base technology of the Solar Sailor and integrates it into an autonomous, unmanned marine vehicle. By harvesting wind, solar, and motion energy, an Unmanned Ocean Vehicle (UOV TM ) does not need fuel. It is self-propelled, self-deployable, and provides an inexhaustible supply of electrical power for sensors and communications. Its endurance is unlimited.  UOV's achieve this performance by integrating these features:     Rigid wing sails covered with solar panels convert wind energy to propulsive energy. The rigid sails fold on deck in severe weather to prevent damage.  Solar panels on all horizontal surfaces to collect electrical energy for electronics, sensors and communications, and for propulsion via electric motor.    Large battery storage capacity sufficient for a week's operation. Provides continuity of power at night and in low wind. Battery weight is necessary for vehicle ballast.  High efficiency DC motor-generator. When the UOV is propelled by wind, the motor-generator is turned by a propeller to generate additional electrical energy. It operates as a drive motor for propulsion in low-wind conditions and for tactical maneuvering.     UOV's are a new approach to achieving wide-area, persistent ocean surveillance for military, oceanographic and commercial applications. The vehicles have the unique ability to multi-task by doing military, intelligence and oceanographic missions concurrently or on a time-share basis.
