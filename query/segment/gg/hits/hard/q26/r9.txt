About the  R/V Sea Explorer  The Ocean Institute is a nationally recognized non-profit, educational facility specializing in marine and environmental science and maritime history. The Ocean Institute operates the 65-foot  R/V Sea Explorer , a marine educational vessel with a research component that is dedicated to environmental education. As an educational platform the vessel is ideal. This floating lab is equipped with onboard computers, satellite technology, touch tanks, viewing aquariums, video microscopes, and state of the art electronics. A bowsprit over the water provides students with a breathtaking view of dolphins, whales and sea lions. Research conducted aboard the vessel becomes a curriculum piece and is included in educational programming to over 15,000 students a year. There is no more unique and poignant learning opportunity for students in grades 5 through college than to participate in authentic statewide research cooperatives. These cooperatives are research projects that involve several organizations working together on geographically large-scale projects. Our research/educational cooperatives include projects with SCCWRP, the California Department of Public Health, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. About monthly, the R/V Sea Explorer trawls the sea floor with a special net called an otter trawl net. Once the fish are aboard, students and trained volunteers identify, count and measure each fish, record and then transfer the data to a central computer at SCCWRP. Other agencies from around the state participate in this project. This study looks at regional trends of benthic (bottom) fish populations along the coast of California. The R/V Sea Explorer participates in a phytoplankton productivity project headed by Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Water samples collected off Dana Point are processed and sent to Scripps for analysis. Chlorophyll reflects the total mass of phytoplankton (drifting plants). These plants are at the bottom of the food chain and so an accurate measurement of these critters reflects the well being of all the animals in the area. The  R/V Sea Explorer works with the California Department of Public Health monitoring blooms of plankton that might be dangerous to human populations. Some plankton produce a biotoxin that can be fatal to birds and sea lions if ingested in large concentrations. In addition we offer exciting programs to the public including educational programs that use oceanographic equipment to sample and examine sea floor sediment and the animals that live there. Other cruises include our Bioluminescence Cruise. Held at night during the new moon--it's darkest then, this trip highlights animals and plants that glow in the dark. During the gray whale migration we offer a marine mammal cruise. For more information go to the  public program page . Everyday the  R/V Sea Explorer interacts with some part of the marine environment. Each day we chronicle at least one account, one interesting interaction with some organism that lives in the sea.         Captain's Blog Learn about the latest sightings from the  RV Sea Explorer .
