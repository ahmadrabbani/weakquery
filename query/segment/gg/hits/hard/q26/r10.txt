     MARITIME SHIP COVERS          FROM NEW ZEALAND        Specialising in Mail from Antarctic, Research and Cruise Liners       "PAQUEBOT  " MAIL.        Under century old UPU regulations, vessels arriving at a foreign port can deposit mail posted in international waters bearing stamps of the country which the ship belongs to or is maintained by. This special arrangement applies for mail posted at the first port of call in each country. Mail posted at  subsequent ports must be franked with stamps of the country being visited. Ship mail posted under this scheme should be marked with the French word "Paquebot" and the stamps cancelled with a distinctive postmark to indicate  treatment as "Paquebot" mail.  Mail must be clearly identifiable as from a particular vessel and is handed to the Post Office by the ships purser or shipping company agent as soon as the ship arrives. This type of mail is seldom seen and accordingly is regarded as very collectable by maritime postal history and ship stamp collectors.
