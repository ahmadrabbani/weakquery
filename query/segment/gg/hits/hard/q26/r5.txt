Sharp   Marine Operations |  R/V Hugh R. Sharp  "Our new ship is a remarkable addition to the U.S. oceanographic research fleet. It will serve marine scientists throughout the Mid-Atlantic region as a state-of-the-art platform for exploring and sampling the coastal ocean." — Dr. Nancy M. Targett, Dean  R/V Hugh R. Sharp at Sea          The R/V HUGH R. SHARP is the newest vessel in the CEOE Fleet. The 146-foot, state-of-the-art coastal research vessel operates as a member of the  University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) . UNOLS is a consortium of 64 academic institutions and national research laboratories. One of its chief functions is to ensure the efficient scheduling of scientific cruises aboard the 28 research vessels located at 21 of its member institutions. The R/V SHARP was featured in  American Ship Review , a special edition of “ Professional Mariner” Magazine, as one of the top ships built in North America during 2006. The R/V SHARP has been described as the most advanced coastal research vessel in the United States. Built by Dakota Creek Industries in Anacortes, Washington, it was delivered in January 2006 and officially commissioned into service in May. The vessel is named in honor of the late Hugh R. Sharp Jr., who served for many years on the University's board of trustees and was a staunch supporter of marine research. The R/V HUGH R. SHARP is a general-purpose vessel. Thanks to its modular design it is capable of supporting a wide range of marine disciplines, including chemical, geological, physical and biological sciences, as well as acoustics, fisheries, and marine mammal research. The vessel is a regional asset, serving researchers from many institutions throughout the mid-Atlantic. The R/V SHARP can carry fourteen to twenty scientists on cruises up to eighteen days in duration. It typically operates in the coastal waters from Long Island, New York, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as well as the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. Projects occasionally require the vessel to work as far north as the Gulf of Maine, as far south as Florida, and as far offshore as Bermuda. Operational support for the HUGH R. SHARP is provided primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Watch the R/V Hugh R.
