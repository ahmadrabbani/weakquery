Tully'           Nathaniel Palmer           Vosper Thornycroft ' Echo / Enterprise'    STXM general research ship design experience is broad and comprehensive, and includes conceptual and contract level design support for a wide range of ship projects. Over the years,  STXM have prepared over 30 designs in funded programmes. These designs include hydrographic, oceanographic, seismic, meteorological and fisheries research vessel types that, depending on the role, required excellent sea-keeping, low noise characteristics, high maneuverability or station-keeping capabilities. In the mid-1980�s  STXM developed the design for the   �John P. Tully�  , a research vessel for the  Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans .  Based on the west coast of Canada, this vessel conducts hydrographic surveys and oceanographic research. This was a full design from concept through to construction.   It is 69 m in length with a beam of 14 m, draft of 4.5 m, and a service speed of 14 knots. In 1989 the company developed the design for the Antarctic research vessel   R.V. Nathaniel B Palmer  �. The design involved full analyses of performance, stability, machinery design, structure, and arrangements with emphasis on minimizing noise and enhancing working conditions. The research facilities incorporated included equipment and systems for oceanography, hydrology, and biochemistry in open water and ice conditions. The design was undertaken to ABS, USCG, OSHA, the Antarctic Conversation Act, and IMO regulations.   STXM also provided on-site construction supervision for this vessel, which combined advanced icebreaker technology, good seakeeping and an advanced scientific electronics package.  HMS Echo and HMS Enterprise  , two new multi-role Survey Vessels (Hydrographic/Oceanographic (SVHOs)) both built by Appledore Shipbuilders under the prime contractor  Vosper Thorneycroft . With HMS Echo launched on 2 March 2002 and HMS Enterprise launched on 27 April 2002. STXM successfully designed the latest Hydrographic/Oceanographic vessels, HMS 'Echo' and HMS 'Enterprise' for tye UK Navy. They have a range of 9300nm at 12 knots and an endurance of 35 days. Operationally available to the Commander in Chief Fleet for 330 days a year, a 50 per cent improvement over older existing vessels. Survey work can be carried out for 90 per cent of the year due to improvements in seakeeping. They are able to collect an array of military hydrographic and oceanographic data and due to their multi-role capability are able to support mine warfare and amphibious operations. Operating a �lean� manned 3 watch system the total Ship�s Company is 72, with 48 personnel onboard at any one time working a cycle of 75 days on, 30 days off; although to meet any contingencies, there is accommodation for 81 personnel.        Seismic R.V.
