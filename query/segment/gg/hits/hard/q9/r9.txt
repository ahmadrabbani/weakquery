Massport works with the TSA to monitor security line length and tries to keep the wait time less than 15 minutes; however to avoid any problems, we recommend arriving two hours prior to domestic departures and three hours prior to international departures to ensure adequate time for check-in, security screening and travel to your gate. Body Scanners  The TSA uses  Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT)  at Boston Logan. Currently, AIT is used in every terminal, but not at every checkpoint. For more information about AIT including  privacy and opt-out information and other  frequently asked questions  please visit  www.tsa.gov . Carry-on Items All items for carry-on must be screened at the security checkpoint. Liquids are allowed in carry-on luggage in accordance with the  3-1-1 format . All liquids must be contained in a bottle three ounces or less and placed inside a one quart, clear, plastic, zip-top bag. One bag per passenger is allowed. There are exceptions for baby food/formula as well as items needed for  special medical purposes .  Note: Ink and toner cartridges over 16 ounces are now banned from both carry-on and checked baggage. View more information about  TSA Prohibited Items . Gate Access  A valid government issued ID and boarding pass are required for gate access through all of Logan’s security checkpoints (accommodations made for children without ID). If you are meeting a child, elderly, or disabled person requiring assistance at the gate, you must contact your  airline in advance to make arrangements for a gate pass. Helpful Tips    Pack smart to get through security faster. Keep luggage organized by layering items; this will increase visibility for the security officers. When approaching the checkpoint, be prepared. Your boarding pass and ID's should be ready for inspection, outer garments and shoes must come off, any loose metal items should be placed in your carry-on, and laptop computers must be removed from bags and placed in a bin for screening.    Traveling with Children? Medications, baby formula and food, breast milk, and juice are allowed in reasonable quantities exceeding 3.4 ounces (100ml) and are not required to be in the zip-top bag; however you must declare these items for inspection at the checkpoint. Please view the  TSA tips for traveling with children to allow for a more stress-free screening process.    Bringing food or gift items home for the holidays? All gifts must be unwrapped for screening (including gifts in checked baggage). View TSA guidelines on  traveling with food or gifts .    Traveling with battery-powered hobby items, toys, or equipment? View the U.S. Department of Transportation’s  rules regarding batteries .
