Worry-free networking. It starts with the industry-standard encryption technologies built into AirPort Extreme, including WPA/WPA2 and 128-bit WEP.* When you turn on encryption — easy to do using AirPort Utility — you’ll ensure that only people with the correct password can join your wireless network. Share the Internet securely with guest networking. If you want to let guests connect to the Internet without giving them your Wi-Fi password, simply enable the guest networking feature and set up a separate Wi-Fi network just for them. Use a different password — or use no password at all — and your primary network, including your printer and any attached drives, remains secure.  Barring the network door. AirPort Extreme includes a built-in firewall that creates a barrier between your network and the Internet, protecting your data from malicious Internet attacks. When you set up the base station, the firewall is automatically turned on to keep the bad guys out. For computers with a cable or DSL modem, using AirPort is actually safer than being directly connected to the modem.  Parent easy, kid safe. A useful access control feature lets you decide not only who accesses your network but also when they can access it. If you have kids with their own computers, for example, you can control the times they’re allowed to access the network. They can have accounts that are available only at certain hours of the day — for example, when you can be home to keep an eye on them.          Choose the best base station for you.        More storage. Faster graphics.        Learn more about AirPort Extreme from Apple customers like you.             Find an  Apple Retail Store . Find your  local authorized reseller .
