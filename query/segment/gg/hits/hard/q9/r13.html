To enhance aviation security, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) began initial testing in October 2003 of its Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) program, in which Behavior Detection Officers identify persons who pose a risk to aviation security by focusing on behavioral and appearance indicators. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to review the SPOT program and analyzed (1) the extent to which TSA validated the SPOT program before deployment, (2) implementation challenges, and (3) the extent to which TSA measures SPOT's effect on aviation security. In conducting its review, GAO analyzed TSA documents, such as strategic plans and operating procedures; interviewed agency personnel and subject matter experts; and visited 15 SPOT airports, among other activities. </p>

<em>U.S. Government Accountability Office, July 31, 2007</em><br>
The aviation security system must ensure that the federal government is ready to respond to actual or potential security threats while a commercial aircraft is in flight. These security threats can include passengers considered to be security risks to aviation onboard flights bound for or leaving the United States; situations that develop while the aircraft is in flight (for example, a passenger becomes disruptive or acts suspiciously, a bomb threat is received, or an unidentified package is found onboard); and a signal transmitted by a commercial aircraft to alert authorities that a hijacking is in process. Depending on the nature of the threat, managing and responding to in-flight security threats can involve extensive coordination among more than 15 federal agencies and their components, each with its own set of responsibilities that may influence the threat response. </p>

            </em>Since the terrorist attacks of 2001, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has approved one air carrier to deploy electronic stun guns. To address reports of injuries from these guns and to ensure that their impact onboard aircraft has been fully evaluated, the U.S. Government Accountability Office sought to discern what analyses the federal government has conducted to assess stun gun safety and effectiveness onboard commercial aircraft, and what controls TSA has in place to ensure uniform, timely review of air carrier requests to deploy these devices.

This white paper proposes solutions to security gaps and financial losses affecting the nation's airline industry. Proposed solutions include separate security fees for passengers and baggage and new methods for transporting baggage. The paper also proposes using other carriers (e.g., the U.S. Postal Service and parcel carriers such as UPS, FedEx, and Airborne) to handle some of the baggage that is currently handled by the airline industry.

<em>Bart Elias, Congressional Research Service, February 2, 2009 </em><br>
Under the framework for national aviation security policy established by the President in 2006, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has developed a publicly available national strategy for aviation security that addresses threats to aviation using a risk-based methodology to complement the overarching National Infrastructure Protection Plan. The strategy seeks to deter and prevent terrorist attacks against aviation, mitigate damage and expedite recovery, and minimize the impact of an attack to the aviation system. The strategy seeks to achieve these objectives by engaging domestic and international partners and carrying out specific actions set forth in a series of supporting plans for operational security, surveillance and intelligence, threat response, system recovery, and coordination. This report discusses the status of these plans and to what extent they address needs, reflect the requirements of law, and align with budget priorities and resource availability. </p>

			</a></strong><em>North American Aerospace Defense Command<br>
			</em>The Visual Warning System (VWS) warns pilots who violate the Air Defense Identification Zone established by the Federal Aviation Administration over Washington, D.C. VWS is a ground-based system that uses safety-tested, low-level beams of alternating green and red lights to alert pilots that they are flying in designated airspace without approval.

<em>The White House, March 26, 2007 </em><br>
The security and economic prosperity of the United States depends significantly on the secure operation of its aviation system and use of the world's airspace. Terrorists, criminals, and hostile nation-states have long viewed aviation as a target for attack and exploitation. This strategy aligns federal government aviation security programs and initiatives into a comprehensive and cohesive national effort involving appropriate local, state, federal, and tribal governments, as well as the private sector, to provide active, layered aviation security for the United States. </p>
