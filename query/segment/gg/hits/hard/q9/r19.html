        charade</b></font></p>
      <p>By Samuel L. Blumenfeld<br>

      <p>It appears that the would-be suicide bomber on the American Airlines 
        flight from Paris to Miami passed through the new security checks with 
        flying colors after some cursory interrogation. And it appears that every 
        hijacker on September 11th would have been able to pass through these 
        same new security checks with even less trouble than their fellow terrorist 
        in Paris. That guy even got through airport security in Israel where he 
        showed up as a tourist. He was questioned on arrival and let go. </p>
      <table border="0" cellpadding="4" align="right">
        <tr>
          <td><img src="010702reidrichard.jpg" width="172" height="216" alt="Richard Reid"><br>
            <font size="2"><b>Reid</b></font> </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>It's hard to know when a terrorist is going to do his work. For example, 
        the hijackers of September 11th took many flights before the fatal ones. 
        However, with this latest character there were blatant signs: He paid 
        $1,800 for his ticket in cash. He looked like a terrorist. He had no check-in 
        baggage. He was known to the French police as Abdel Rahim, a Muslim convert, 
        using an Islamic name other than the one of Richard Reid on his British 
        passport. And they didn't bother to check his sneakers because no one 
        had ever heard of plastic bombs being concealed in heels.</p>
      <p>It took an alert flight attendant to spot the terrorist in the act of 
        lighting a match to set off the bombs in his shoes. I wonder if she had 
        been warned to keep an eye on the guy. In any case, it took the flight 
        attendant and a half dozen passengers to tie the terrorist down and secure 
        him for the rest of the flight. </p>
      <p>In other words, the real security for today's flights is on the plane 
        itself, made up of cabin crews and passengers. The security people at 
        the airport can't stop a terrorist from boarding a plane if they don't 
        have solid proof of what he intends to do. In other words, today's improved 
        airport security is a big joke. They spend more time searching little 
        old ladies and children than they do those, whose ethnic profiles ring 
        bells and flash red lights. They're more concerned about violating the 
        civil rights of potential terrorists than they are about catching them. 
        After all, if they mistakenly prevent someone from getting on a plane, 
        they may be sued. </p>
      <p>In fact, it has been reported that the Islamic member of Bush's security 
        team who was questioned and delayed before being allowed to board a commercial 
        flight to join his boss in Texas, may sue the airline for ethnic profiling 
        or some other high crime. And if that sucker can't understand why Americans 
        are so jittery about air travel, he has no business guarding our President. 
        As a security guard himself, he should have congratulated the personnel 
        at the airport for wanting to check him out. And if he is so unpatriotic 
        and venal as to sue the airline, I would be very suspicious of his ultimate 
        motives and not have him so close to the President. After all, it took 
        five years for the terrorists to plan their murderous attacks on September 
        11th, and President Sadat of Egypt was assassinated by members of his 
        own security team.</p>
      <p>So caution goes out the window, and flight crews and passengers have 
        become the front line in the war against terrorists. Passengers will have 
        to do their own ethnic profiling in the boarding lounge before they decide 
        whether or not to get on that plane.</p>
      <p>As we all know, ethnic profiling is politically incorrect, especially 
        since President Bush has bent over backwards to get Americans to look 
        at their Islamic fellow citizens as benign lovers of peace. Even the head 
        of the FAA believes that ethnic profiling is bad since as a child of Japanese 
        ancestry he and his parents were interned in a camp during World War II. 
        So what we now do at airports is pretend that we have improved security. 
        After all, we have national guardsmen with automatic weapons patrolling 
        the airports, and everyone is searched a little more thoroughly. And now 
        we can expect teenage girls with those new style heels that look like 
        they can hide nuclear weapons will be thoroughly examined.</p>
      <p>Ethnic profiling works. It doesn't take a Sherlock Holmes to spot a potentially 
        dangerous individual on a passenger list. Most of the people who fly would 
        pass the security test with no problems: retired couples; families with 
        small children; businessmen with laptops; students on their way to and 
        from schools; servicemen and women; pilots and crew members on vacation, 
        high rollers on their way to Vegas. Anyone can walk down an aisle of a 
        plane, look at the passengers and pick out the scary ones.</p>
      <p>Hints for personnel at the check-in counters: Anyone who doesn't have 
        a frequent flyer account should be under suspicion. Anyone who buys a 
        one-way ticket with cash and has no baggage ought to be under suspicion. 
        Any young Islamic Arab who hasn't a good reason to be going anywhere ought 
        to be under suspicion. Americans don't need ID cards. What we need is 
        common sense. If there is anyone who should be inconvenienced by airport 
        security, it should be those who come under suspicion, not the average 
        American traveler. Since every passenger must come to the check-in counter, 
        it is there that potential terrorists can be spotted and escorted to a 
        room for interrogation. But apparently you can't keep a potential terrorist 
        off a plane if he is not wanted by the police or committing a criminal 
        act.</p>
      <p>But now that heels can conceal bombs, we can expect security officers 
        to inspect everyone's heels instead of just those who arouse suspicion. 
        Richard Reid triggered all the alarms but got through. So what good are 
        the alarms if such an obvious candidate for terrorism can get through? 
        The solution? Inform flight attendants of suspicious passengers and watch 
        them like hawks. Of course, the security people tell us that no system 
        is foolproof. What they mean is that they really can't protect us from 
        those determined to kill us.</p>
      <p>Of course, an upstanding, frequent flying citizen is not permitted to 
        carry a gun aboard a plane for his own protection against a terrorist. 
        Even little old ladies have had their knitting needles confiscated because 
        they can be used as weapons. But that's the very reason why the knitting 
        needles should be permitted, so that passengers can have more than their 
        bare knuckles and a few leather belts with which to fight these terrorists.</p>
      <p>Flyer beware! That's the motto for today's air traveler. And be prepared 
        to do hand-to-hand combat on the plane. <img src="../../../images/esr.jpg" width="24" height="13"></p>
