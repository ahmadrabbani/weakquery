Those wishing to see the system,  first introduced in June , can now catch a glimpse at an aviation security conference in Amsterdam. The hi-tech set up retains the familiar lane set-up -- but the  similarities end there reports the  Daily Mail . The new system has passengers walking through one of three 20-foot tunnels, marked "enhanced," "normal" or "known traveler," a reference to programs in which fliers submit personal data before flying in exchange for lighter scrutiny at checkpoints. Equipment in each tunnel would scan passengers as they walk through -- meaning no more x-ray machines, emptying of pockets or removing of shoes and jackets. TSA chief John Pistole says his agency is generally on-board with the idea, telling the  Mail , "It's an idea clearly worth consideration as technology develops. Segmenting the passenger population for different levels of security screening is exactly what we're pursuing." The concept -- high-minded as it may be -- still faces numerous technical and financial hurdles,  says the  Daily Mail  , which adds privacy advocates will likely protest any planned launch of the body-scanning technology at airport checkpoints in the US.        1   of 4      FIRST SLIDE   PREVIOUS SLIDE                         READ WHOLE POST      It's Not Too Late For A New York City Thanksgiving: Get Your Macy's Parade On!

Airports and airlines have employees that have to go through extensive background checks yearly. These enployees have to take routine corses in safety, recognize possible threats, about danger goods and hazardous materials. Many employees have access to the aircrafts and the secure side of the airport. However, when they are going to take a trip and fly, they have to go the same BS as public passengers ­. Now TSA want to give some flyers a "Checkpoin ­t" security bypass.Whi ­ch will probaly not be available to airline employees. Also, dog are just as effective as the TSA multi-mill ­ion equipment to detect explosives olives. Another wasteful program The facts are that the TSA have spent BILLIONS on trying to keep the airports squeaky clean of any threats, and there only MAYBE been two possible real threats. I wish the US Law Enforcemen ­t was that effective to keep those that are driving under the influence and those that do not have in auto insurance, and catch those that are texting and talking on the cell phone. Now, that where I will feel more safe.     crawfordslc: TSA does not use common sense in its procedures to http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/crawfordslc/airport-security-checkpoint-future_n_1000018_113172736.html  History   |   Permalink   |  Share it        Georgia Yankee  73 Fans     09:14 PM on 10/10/2011  Just flew out of Atlanta this morning.

They complain they want security, but they dont want to be "inconveni ­enced". They get patdowns. They complain about that. They get scanners, they complain about that. Now instead of standing there..arm ­s outstretch ­ed, you simply walk down a corridor. And I'm sure complainer ­s will arise then. Facts are that someone or something HAS to look at the scans. In fact it can be like metal detectors. ­..the scanner scans you. If the PROGRAM figures out that you have something that shows up...a signal is given to the person to pull you out of the ine and taken to room for a private search. How about that? Facts are we cannot go back to the 50s where you could walk from your car directly to the plane, with your family to see you off at your seat on the plane. Nor can they sit on the balcony and watch you take off either.

Facts are there SHOULD be profiling. I hope they DO profile. Ask ANY muslim who isnt a terrorist or terrorist symphathis ­er and ask if they would take an extra few minutes to get through in order for a safe flight.... ­they would say yes. You want safety, but you want it without interrupti ­ng or slowing down your lifestyle. You live in the past when you could walk directly from car to plane with your luggage and board. You want safety, the profiling for terrorists is necessary. You dont want invasive patdowns? then use scanners. SOMEONE has to look and see if its ok. Or would you rather they pick people at random to search?     S321: Again the complainers about profiling.

Profiling has been tried before by various law enforcemen ­t agencies using the excuse of "random traffic stops". Some states couldn't keep up with the lawsuits.

So, who are we trusting with our personal informatio ­n and what are they going to be allowed to do with it?
