It is interwoven into the architectural fabric of airport operations—protecting passengers, employees, information, and infrastructure. Our passenger processing systems—such as  vMUSE ™—enhance security by allowing airlines to share vital passenger and baggage information in real time, on high-speed multi-user networks. From traditional check-in, to common-use kiosks, to off-site locations, ARINC assures airlines can access the information they need when they need it, while maintaining the privacy of their passengers. ARINC’s  Identity Management System (IdMS) uses biographical and biometric information to authenticate passenger data, screen employees, and track workers throughout the airport more efficiently and securely than ever before. Transitioning from 2-D barcode bag tags to  RFID tracking significantly increases baggage processing security. Airlines can match bags with passengers anywhere in the airport and beyond, making sure a bag does not get on a plane that a passenger doesn’t. Beyond-line-of-sight tracking and sensing allows bags to be found and rerouted much more quickly than through manual processes. ARINC also delivers comprehensive  Intrusion Detection System (IDS)—fully-integrated with our  Advanced Information Management (AIM) system—to provide video surveillance,  CCTV ,  access control , and secure area access management. From analysis and design, to integration, installation, and testing, we offer full life-cycle services optimized and scaled for any size airport. AviNet —ARINC’s private, highly reliable voice and communications network—provides critical backbone security throughout the entire airport architecture for all messaging, wireless, and broadband services.                   Copyright    ARINC Incorporated  1 800 633 6882  Legal   Privacy Policy   A Portfolio Company of  The Carlyle Group       Home  About Us  Careers  Contact Us  Industries  News  Resources  Site Map  Strategic Alliances  Worldwide
