The nipple slip occurred at the end of Grace’s quickstep, prompting ABC to cut away to a shot of the audience,   Us  reports.  “On the European version that would be perfectly fine,” host Tom Bergeron said when they cut back to a readjusted Grace. “It was a bit top-heavy at times, my darling,” joked judge Bruno Tonioli. “And I got an eyeful! I couldn't miss that.” Ultimately, the wardrobe malfunction didn’t appear to affect her score, 21 out of 30 points. Ricki Lake came in first for the night with 23 out of 30.  Less »        Nancy Grace Has Wardrobe Malfunction  Back to story »       Nancy Grace and Tristan MacManus perform the quickstep on "Dancing With the Stars."
