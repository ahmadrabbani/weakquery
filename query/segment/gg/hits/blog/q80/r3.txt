Let's all call Nancy Grace's line and harass her about her "nip slip" or farting on live tv. Her personal office number would be great! 77140573 Flag this comment  Rumpole said on November 18, 2011 at 8:27 AM It does not matter as to what the people that want to express their opinion think; the matter is in the hands of the legal system, and that is where it should be. Now it is up to the prosecutor and others directly involved to do their job, not the fans of this so called tv hotshot. 77140211 Flag this comment  citsman1725 said on November 18, 2011 at 8:04 AM I agree, something should be done since it seems she intentionally interferred with emergency services. She thinks she is above the law I guess. It's amazing how one person can have such an influence over so many people. I don't watch her show and don't ever intend to watch her show. Why did she give out the number in the first place? Was she against how the police handled the situation? 77138943 Flag this comment  Rumpole said on November 18, 2011 at 7:49 AM It is my hope that any individual needing assistance of any kind; fire, ambulance, or police did not have to sit there and wait for a dispatcher. If I had my way she would be arrested for interfering with emergency services, however all that would do is make the crowd that watches her come out of the woodwork, and try to be a real pain in the a_ _ as the so called occupiers have become. 77138164 Flag this comment            Sign Out  Profile    Mobile  RSS Feeds  Special Offers  Newsletters  Twitter  Facebook  Widgets  Boss Button  Set Home Page        Local News Video   Budget problems arise with patrols merger   add to reading list       Man shot in backside in Central West End after robbery   add to reading list       Outdoor ice skating rink opening downtown   add to reading list       Property owner accused of leaving properties in disrepair   add to reading list       St. Charles wants $12 million for road work, transportation center   add to reading list         More Videos |  More Local News Videos   Most Popular Most Viewed  Most Emailed    Update:  Mother accused of killing baby boy goes before judge with no attorney      Prosecutors: Affton toddler died of blunt force trauma; mother charged      Young children found alone wandering Granite City street only wearing underwear      Hundreds with Occupy St. Louis march to MLK Bridge to protest; 14 arrested      Slain infant’s father speaks out about son’s death        DWI costs Mizzou's Pinkel $300,000  Hundreds with Occupy St. Louis march to MLK Bridge to protest; 14 arrested      Man shot while standing in St. Louis alley     Police searching for armed robber targeting women in South City     Man shot in backside in Central West End after robbery     More> >     Home  News  Weather  Traffic  Sports  Entertainment  Video  Community  Marketplace  YouNews  Great Day  On TV    KMOV.com  (314) 621-4444 (phone) (314) 621-3367 (fax) website@kmov.com  Search      Contact Us  Employment  Advertising  Terms Of Service    Privacy Policy   © 2009-2011 KMOV-TV, Inc., a subsidiary of Belo Corp.
