By  Amelia Robinson  | Tuesday, October 6, 2009, 02:11 PM  Yeah, she’s meaner that a raccoon trapped in a trash bin, but you know who is also pretty awesome - Nancy Grace.  The fireball CNN talk show host gave Jon Gosselin the ‘what for’ on the Insider Monday, Oct. 5.   He was called on his ‘you know what’ big time by the shark.  >  you agree with Nancy Grace on this one?  ( )http://www.polldaddy.com"> polls ) >   Grace all but called Gosselin a hypocrite, pointing out that for years Gosselin had his kids on the TLC reality show. “Suddenly when it is no longer ‘Jon and Kate Plus 8’ and it is ‘Kate Plus 8’ you suddenly have a problem with it and want it to come to an end,” she said. “What’s important is the children and not these two self-absorbed husband and wife who argue constantly in front of their children.” Gosselin said he wants to mediate the situation with estranged wife Kate.  But good old crazy Nancy wasn’t fooled.  “You talk the talk but you can’t walk the walk,” Grace said, adding that while Jonny stays out partying with 22-year-old women Kate stays home with the kids.  Jon last week put the brakes on Kate’s hopes for a show without him.  He told TLC to shut down production of “Kate Plus Eight.” Read  “Could it be no Jon, no Kate, no plus eight? Jon gets show shut down”   Permalink |  Comments (34) |   Post your comment | Categories:  Star trouble   Comments  By  Sherry   October 6, 2009 2:49 PM |  Link to this     you go nancy grace. since tlc doesn’t seem to want jon anymore he thinks she shouldn’t have the show either..bull** on that. he’s the one that left not her..so put that in your pipe and smoke it jon the cry baby..       By  Michele   October 6, 2009 3:30 PM |  Link to this     Way to Go Nancy!!! It is about time that someone put the jerk in his place. I realize it takes “two to tango”, but pulling money out of the checking account - used to pay the bills for the family! How low can he go?

I realize it takes “two to tango”, but pulling money out of the checking account - used to pay the bills for the family! How low can he go?       By  flipper   October 6, 2009 3:48 PM |  Link to this     This dude is ugly. Who would want to party with him? I’m surprised Kate got jiggy with him. She can show preapproval by him anyway. Publicity monger.       By  CockerSpanielGal   October 6, 2009 4:05 PM |  Link to this     Support his career? What career? His income came solely from the backs of his kids. He has no talent, the public hates him, and he has lost his family. Jon needs to pick up his toys and go home to his family. He had nothing going for him but his family, and he has thrown it away.       By  banyur   October 6, 2009 4:29 PM |  Link to this     for one time i have think to my limit. is most bad to be terrible at job or more most bad to do dream job and every person hate and not feel? mrs. amelia, wonerding if you has other skill. has other job to spend day, do not quit. i say from know. i have job in village before america, gather wood in pratama and carry to bugash on feet! very pride. one hundred better of you type opinion of television man and woman. puh make you.       By  Diane   October 6, 2009 4:36 PM |  Link to this     What kind of an idiot is banyur ?!? That comment or rambling has no meaning at all WYH??? Jon and Kate both need to be so over.Nancy Grace has 2 kids and she thinks she knows it all. I respect her and her show- but come on!She and Kate have cooks, maids,nannies, etc. THEY need to walk the walk the rest of us do.       By  Beavercreek mom   October 6, 2009 4:55 PM |  Link to this     Banyur you are an idiot.       By  nothingbutwomen   October 6, 2009 6:07 PM |  Link to this     Seems all you shallow no life women that watched the show are bitter now because it was cancelled. Their both money grubbing gold diggers who are BOTH exploiting their kids. Only in America. Jon’s biggest mistake ever was marrying the B I T C H named Kate.       By  fleecy   October 6, 2009 7:01 PM |  Link to this     i love how you all have the answers. all this judging as if you know that family personally.       By  Middletown Guy   October 6, 2009 7:24 PM |  Link to this     Nancy, most of the time you sound so Whinney that I can’t stand you, but KUDOS on this one. Jon’s immaturity is jumping out big time. Greedy A** Jon.       By  Mitz   October 6, 2009 7:54 PM |  Link to this     Nancy needs to get over herself. Talks about Jon partying and not being with the kids. Where are the kids when Kate is traveling around the country doing all the talk shows and all the crap she does. I don’t think either one of them deserve to have such beautiful kids.       By  Nahreally?   October 6, 2009 8:27 PM |  Link to this     ROFL @ all of the women jumping in here to give Nancy kudos for her obvious preconceived bias and double standards as she addressed the situation. Both parents are exploiting pieces of crap in this situation, but she, and the women posting comments on her automatically take Kate’s side in this. Typical female logic…it’s ALWAYS the man’s fault. Yeah…as if Kate herself doesn’t put the show on her list of priorities over her children. There are even a plethora of instances on which this is evident RIGHT THERE ON CAMERA…but yeah, you chicks wanna give Jon all the s**t for this while seemingly giving Kate a pass for this. You sanctimonious morons can all take your bias and shove it. I bet you all rob guys out of pocket over child support all while you sit on your asses and collect welfare w/ the court system right behind you on it.       By  Lee   October 6, 2009 8:44 PM |  Link to this     Nancy is a B_tch! Battle-axes stick together…gets lonely being so butch though!       By  Lee   October 6, 2009 8:49 PM |  Link to this     I am a woman and I dont agree with Nancy.She is the kind who wants to beat a man down and then expects a stand-up man to result. Why would any man love you when you are such a butch-@ss bytch? Run Jon!       By  bubba gump   October 6, 2009 9:12 PM |  Link to this     Nah really - dude, I’m pretty sure you cannot collect welfare if you are collecting child support - if so, its very little. Have to disagree with you there - although have to agree on alot of your other points       By  Nahreally?   October 6, 2009 9:41 PM |  Link to this     @bubba gump - Yeah, I kinda made a mistake on that one…was simply heated in the moment. …but yeah, I can’t wait for the day that someone digs a few skeletons out of Nancy Grace’s closet so that bitter, high-and-mighty old bird gets knocked off of her high horse. You’ll usually find that the most self-righteous folk are the ones that do the most dirt and sweep it under the rug, then are quick to point the finger at everyone else. Who told this woman she was God all of a sudden?       By  Nahreally?   October 6, 2009 9:43 PM |  Link to this     @flipper - Your comment leads me to believe that you must be a child, and if so, I’ll just disregard your statement altogether. …if not, don’t ever have children.       By  Sherry RN   October 6, 2009 10:05 PM |  Link to this     Umm… since they have shared custody, he doesn’t have rights to the children when Kate had them. So what he chooses to do on his own time is fair game. It doesn’t matter with whom or where or how many times. Once again, when Kate has the kids, he has no rights to see them - aka shared custody. And really, if you watch Nancy Grace, chances are great that you are poor, white, and probably rent or own a home valued at less than 100K. You also probably are the gossip spreader, and the neighbor that is in everyone’s business. If that makes you mad, we both know why.       By  Cheryl B   October 6, 2009 10:13 PM |  Link to this     You are absolutely right and I don’t understand why people don’t get it. I think that they want the drama soooo bad that they either lose common sense, or worse yet, never had it. Their shared custody means when Kate has the kids, he doesn’t and when John has the kids, Kate doesn’t. So what is he ‘supposed’ to do when he cannot, yes, cannot see the kids? Read a book? Sob at home in a manic depressive state? Stalk Kate? No? How about going out and having as much fun as he wants, since he is not harming the children? Sorry people, not everyone sits at home when they are single and CANNOT see their children.       By  Julie   October 7, 2009 3:47 AM |  Link to this     Kuddos to Nancy Grace!!! I’m glad someone spoke up and called Jon to the carpet for his behavior. Lets all blame kate for being a bitchy woman and ignore the fact that Jon has stopped all income for his family, he has no job, he keeps lieing about everything, hes fat, he’s pimply faced, he chain smokes, he is never around his kids, he keeps sleeping with stupid women who fall for his lines even though he is still married, he drains the family bank accounts…do I need to continue?       By  Julie has been stood up before   October 7, 2009 5:02 AM |  Link to this     Julie, poor Julie. Most people will stop reading your post after they find out you actually watch Nancy Grace. That is not something a ‘normal’ person admits. Not to mention that you apparently admire her - that puts you in a very low class structure.       By  Sugar   October 7, 2009 8:58 AM |  Link to this     Julie! Bitter or scared? You really need to learn the lesson here if its not already too late for you! You cant control a man into loving you. Those kids are FINE. Id like to sell YOU some real-estate!       By  No No Nancy   October 7, 2009 12:39 PM |  Link to this     Nancy Grace is a vapid, sensationalist idiot.       By  lili   October 7, 2009 3:27 PM |  Link to this     Nancy grace you go girl…Jon you are such a loser!!!       By  Ninnie   October 7, 2009 3:53 PM |  Link to this     You GO Nancy Grace! Jon is an idiot. Kate…not my fave, but hey, she’s at home taking care of 8 children while he’s out with his old self preying on ignorant young women who only want the “fame” and hopefully his money!       By  daylilly   October 7, 2009 4:23 PM |  Link to this     I am glad Nancy made the points she made and that John was totally thrown off his game by the questions. I think the children are loved by the parents, but man Jon really needs to mature and get out the me MODE and Kate appears to have a mean streak and does want $ and a career. I just hope they both mature and stay off TV!! and really work on this problem. Sadddddddddddd !!       By  Chrissy C.   October 7, 2009 4:38 PM |  Link to this     High-five for Nancy! Using children for financial gain is immature and selfish. I would go to the end of the Earth and back for my daughter and unborn child. Putting a child’s identity on television and the internet is dangerous and to profit from it is absolutely ridiculous. This is a scary world we are living in and children are exploited and some people have absolutely no problem with this. It is our job to protect our children, not exploit them.       By  Treb D   October 7, 2009 5:03 PM |  Link to this     The media is keeping this going for ratings. WHY…… the children need to be taken from both of them.       By  Michelle   October 7, 2009 9:09 PM |  Link to this     Jon and Kate both need therapy. America watched Kate treat him like crap show after show. So what if got a taste of the single life? He was with those kids while she was off signing her books… Then she has her time with them. Sad for the kids, but lets be honest someone should of pulled the plug on this show long ago… Now those poor kids have to watch re runs of thier parents treating each other like crap and talk about each other.. They are the real ones suffering. They will need the therapy and if Jon has come to his senses and wants to try to work on his family, give him a break to do just that.       By  What??   October 8, 2009 12:28 AM |  Link to this     Who the hell is nancy grace? Who the hell is Jon and Kate? Who cares??       By  nancy   October 8, 2009 2:26 PM |  Link to this     What I think is a real shame is now 8 little children are now going to be raised without their Father basically. I don’t think he has any right to shut down the show because that is a way she can support herself and her children.He is the one that decided to cheat and although you never know what goes on behind closed doors he still should have thinking about his children. No woman in her right mind is going to want him and his children for very long. Right now it has to be for the fame.       By  so sad   October 8, 2009 2:44 PM |  Link to this     I don’t think she knows what went on in the marriage but it still gave him no right to cheat. Now he can go on living his life in New York or wherever and basically forget he has children so he has no right to deny Kate a way to support her children. If she does not have the shows money coming in then it’s going to have to come from him and let’s see how much do you think it’s going to cost him in child support. Frankly he’d be so broke he would’nt even have enough left after whatever he decides to do he won’t have enough to rent him a place. He should have thought of all of this before he decided he wanted to play. I feel sorry for the children.       By  So much ignorance   October 9, 2009 9:37 PM |  Link to this     It’s obvious that a lot of the comments in here are very ignorant and baseless. All a lot of you pretty much have to go on is Nancy Grace’s word, of whom doesn’t have a clue herself. They have SHARED CUSTODY, which means either of them as adults can pretty much do whatever they want while the other has the children..too complicated? I’ll dumb it down for the inbred morons who type without thinking…when Kate has the kids, Jon is free to do whatever, and vice versa. Regardless of what she, and the overly dramatic media may want you to think, poor lil self-pitying guilt projecting Kate IS NOT STUCK AT HOME ALONE WITH THE KIDS. She gets the kids for a certain period of time, and then after that, Jon gets the kids. I’m damned sure that Kate goes out and lives it up just as much as Jon does…it just so happens that the castrated media wants to keep the camera on Jon whenever he’s out whilst trying to paint Kate as if she’s taken the moral high road the whole time. Anyone with a brain and common sense would know that this is b/s, and that both of them are exploiting losers that eat off of their children. You people are forming stupid, shallow, misinformed opinions based off of what you’ve heard on TV…and are only making fools of yourselves.         Post a comment   Name:  E-mail * :  Remember me?
