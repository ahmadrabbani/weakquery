Grace danced her quickstep so forcefully that her dressed slipped in exactly the wrong place, accidentally exposing a nipple. Grace didn't realize it but the audience sure seemed to, looking stunned and stonyfaced as Grace finished her dance. Host Tom Bergeron alerted Grace to the problem and joked, "On the European version that would be perfectly fine." Grace buried her head in her dancing partner's shoulder, but seemed to take it in stride. The incident was edited out of the West Coast version. Grace still got high scores from the judges. In an  interview with reporters after the show , she even denied that anything had gone wrong. "Tonight, when we were doing our hopscotch portion of our dance, there was a little bit of movement but it did not rise to a wardrobe malfunction," she said.

My unfortunat ­e experience with Nancy Grace. I will briefly explain. I was a witness for prosecutio ­n in the drunk pilots in Miami trial. I wore a very nice white linen suit with a crochet beige top. The court proceeding ­s were televised with the camera placement on a 10 foot ladder aimed directly down on me giving the appearance of major cleavage. Nancy Grace ridiculed me for weeks by discussing my breast on national TV. you can imagine my embarrassm ­ent and trust me she was fully aware of the camera placement. The good news is my cleavage was much more appealing to the eye than her saggy nipple hanging out, sorry for the poor audience at the taping of Dancing with the stars! I have never spoken out in blogs or any media but this opened the door to to speak against the attention media seeking witch that she is!     Denise_Eaves_Boger: KARMA IS ALIVE AND WELL!!!
