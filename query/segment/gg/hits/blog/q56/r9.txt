Her father is a nuclear physicist and her mother is a computer programmer. She spent her childhood dancing and fishing with her father. While at Fremont High School, she was captain of the Featherettes, a dance team which had the look of regular cheerleaders, with the exception of the large head dresses they would wear. She was voted "Most Likely to Become a Solid Gold Dancer" by her graduating class in 1982. Hatcher studied acting at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco while taking a degree course in mathematics and engineering at De Anza College in Cupertino, California. She became a member of the 1984 Gold Rush, the name of the professional cheer leading squad of the American football San Francisco 49ers. Hatcher went to Hollywood to lend moral support to a friend during a open casting call. She, however, auditioned and won the role of the singing and dancing mermaid for the television series,    "The Love Boat"   (1977). She went on to play Penny Parker, a ditsy but sweet-hearted struggling actress in    "MacGyver"   (1985). When that show ended, she auditioned for and won the role of smart and savvy Lois in    "Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"   (1993), saying that she didn't want to be stuck with the pretty airhead image she had acquired as Penny. She married actor    Jon Tenney   in May 1994. She gave birth to daughter Emerson Rose Tenney on November 10, 1997. Later, she signed to play Sally Bowles in the road tour of Cabaret. The tour    debut   ed in Los Angeles on March 2, 1999. Her final show was on September 4, 1999. She stayed out of the industry for a little bit before nabbing a role on the darkly, comedic soap opera    "Desperate Housewives"   (2004), which could have been a huge mistake. The show turned out to be a mega hit, which skyrocketed Hatcher to the A-list. Her portrayal of a divorced mother, Susan Mayer, was consistently named as America's favorite Desperate Housewife. Hatcher won both a Golden Globe for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and the SAG    Award   for Female Actor in a Comedy Series before the show's first season was even over.
