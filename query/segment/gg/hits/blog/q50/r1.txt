If we only have one or two salaries posted for for a given job title, showing that salary information may risk employee anonymity. So in that case we generate an anonymous salary range by adding and subtracting a small percentage from the posted salary. The small percentage difference offers additional anonymity while still minimizing the difference between the range and the employee's actual salary.
