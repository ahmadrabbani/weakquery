A brand  manager typically ensures the quality and successful  promotion of a certain line of products. He or she analyzes sales figures, sets prices, and oversees advertising campaigns. The manager explores different marketing strategies and directly contacts retailers to convince them to carry a brand. Brand managers work in almost every large  corporation that manufactures commercial or consumer products, from packaged foods to home electronics to industrial machinery. Excellent written and verbal communication skills typically are essential to be a successful brand manager. Professionals hold telephone and in-person conferences with retailers to promote their brands, negotiate prices and shipping quantities, and set up orders. They also meet with product developers, sales personnel, copywriters, and advertising directors to make sure that every aspect of production, distribution, and marketing is in sync. New advertising campaigns usually are organized by the brand manager. He or she analyzes the successes and shortcomings of previous campaigns to determine better ways to promote the products of the company. The manager reviews the work of copywriters and art directors to make sure that a new campaign will be attractive to customers. Extensive  market research must be conducted to determine how and where to advertise a product. In order to target certain consumer demographics, the brand manager may decide to create advertisements in the form of billboards, product catalogs, magazine spots, or television commercials. Many companies dedicate a large portion of their advertising budgets on Internet campaigns. Managers oversee the creation of banner ads, interactive Websites, and short commercial videos.  If a particular product is not selling well, the brand manager will consider many different options to help raise sales figures. He or she might ask for consumer input to determine why people are unsatisfied with the product. The manager communicates with research and development personnel to suggest quality improvements or changes. If competing products are selling better than the manager's brand, he or she can implement new advertising strategies or make the decision to lower prices. Most brand managers hold college degrees in  business administration or marketing. Some professionals are able to obtain jobs with bachelor's degrees, though master's degrees are required for employment by most large corporations. An individual may be able to advance to the rank of brand manager after gaining experience and excelling in sales and advertising positions within a company. Most professionals begin their  brand management careers as assistants to experienced managers so they can become familiar with the duties and responsibilities of the job. A successful brand manager may eventually have the opportunity to advance to a top executive position.   Related Videos   Related wiseGEEK Articles  What Does a Product Line Manager Do?
