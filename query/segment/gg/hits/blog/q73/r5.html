<p> </p>
<hr width="100%">These articles were written out of frustration with
wind generated energy. People see windmills and "say look at this it's
renewableenergy now that's good!" The fact is it looks good on the
outside but is rotten to the core on the inside.This industry cannot
operate with out lots of support in the form of production tax credits,
and other rip off's cheep
production of power is not their goal.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.darrylmueller.com/cal.energy.html">California
Energy Plan 2/15/2002</a> 10,000
windmills produced an insignificant amount of energy. The installed
1,000 MW can only be counted as 200 MW of dependable capacity. This
lead to blackouts and
business flight out of the state. The Recall Governor Elect <a
 href="http://www.schwarzenegger.com/index.asp">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>
could have helped the junk bond rating of Calif. and the deficit
spending on by backing down from renewable energy plans of EX Governor
Gray Davis. Millions of wasteful spending to renew the broken down
windmills and add
massive new huge monsters to suck revenue out of the state. Florida
light
and Power has been a real big player buying up defunk windmill
companies,
and cashing in on the wright off's and production tax credits, which
the
Bush Administration continues to fund for renewable energy. <br>
<br>
Drop the <a href="http://www.schwarzenegger.com/index.asp">Gov. Arnold
a email</a> a tell him&nbsp; what is going on with his
renewable energy program. Having rate payers put in solar panels<br>
the most expensive type of power out their to install, so they can sell
it back to the utility, only though subsidies can this happen.

At that piont February 20, 1986 a line is drawn. Don't build windmills
were raptors and birds areare.<br>
I wrote many letters to Alameda County and Contra Costa County and
other counties to make them aware of the statement, and they ignored
this statement. Does this mean that Alameda County ignored killing of
Golden Eagles and other raptors? <br>
There response along with Contra Costa County has been to stall with
studies. And when the studies came back then more studies. All along
the killing continues. <br>
The Counties position now is away from 2 year conditional use permits
and to issue long term permits and the killing still goes on.<br>

&nbsp;2/12/02</a> This is important because it admits how unreliable
windenergy is and lead to blackouts. 1000 megawats is only worth is
counted as 250 megawats. California could produce real cheep power.
California's continues to spend millions of California's utility users
money on this non reliable form of power. With the heavy spending that
Gray Davis did and no concern for cheep and reliable&nbsp; energy
California had power blackouts. We were hoping
that this wreckless give away of money would stop.</p>
<p>With the 2003 Special Recall Election Gray Davis, supported and
backed by California Unions was thrown out of office.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p> Govenor <a href="http://www.schwarzenegger.com/index.asp">Arnold
Schwarzenegger</a> could make a difference, and spend
money into affordable reliable generation of power. Instead programs to
renew windmills, and put solor pannels systems on houses
continues.&nbsp; The cost of this to produce power is off the charts
and is funded by Public Utility Programs it can't support it's self.
Only with Production Tax Credits and other Subsidies can it operate.
The end result higher taxes to pay for the programs. 1.5
cents per kw. conventional power, aulternive's power can range 6 or
more
times. <br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><font

the introduction (Page 1):</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><font
 face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#8220; The California Renewable Portfolio
Standard (RPS), established&#8230;in 2002, calls for the state&#8217;s investor
owned utilities (IOUs), energy service providers (ESPs), and community
choice aggregators (CCAs) to meet 20 percent of their electricity load
with eligible sources of renewable energy by 2017.&#8221;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><font
 face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#8220;Much has already been
accomplished&#8230;the state&#8217;s three major IOUs&#8230;have recently signed a large
number of contracts for renewable energy capacity&#8230;if each of these new
projects achieves commercial operations, total deliveries could equate
to 3.1 to 5.4 percent of IOUs&#8217; combined 2004 electricity load.&#8221;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><font
 face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#8220;Nonetheless, the state as a whole has
fallen behind schedule in meeting its aggressive renewable energy
targets, and few new renewable energy projects have achieved commercial
operation over the last several years.&#8221;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><font
 face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#8220;Though a number of procurement
strategies can be used to reduce the risk of contract failure, even
these strategies cannot eliminate the possibility of unfulfilled
contracts, and some of these strategies may have the unfortunate effect
of reducing the number of renewable energy bids and raising bid prices.&#8221;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><font
 face="Times New Roman" size="3">I always find it refreshing to see a
few FACTS mixed in with the massive&nbsp;flow of information on
&#8220;renewables&#8221; &#8211; which information is usually dominated by propaganda

Treatment
Plant that would supply water to Livermore, Dublin &amp; Pleasanton. No
water for Altamont families. This treatment plant and pipeline cost is
paid
for by the developers. No cost to Zone 7. Altamont families think it
makes
more sense to build smaller plants in the development areas, this does
not need to be built on Dyer Rd. At the very least Dyer Road families
should
get water. No fire hydrants, Yes Zone 7 plans to dig up Dyer Rd.
install
a new water line 42 inch in diameter and will not give Dyer Rd. water
or
fire protection. <br>
The EIR was certified 2/05 by Zone 7 water board.<br>
<br>
<big><big>Zone 7 Water Board wants to change the E.I.R. with addendum,
for Altamont Pass Pipeline. </big></big><br>
<br>
On 2/10/06 some Dyer Rd. residents get a notice of addendum to changes
E.I.R. And that on 2/15/06, 5 days, changes to Zone 7 EIR would be
presented to the board.&nbsp; Zone 7 had email and phone numbers but
chose regulat mail. <br>
Changes include close of Altamont Pass Rd. for pipiline
construction,&nbsp; moving the pipeline into Dyer Rd. which is 20 ft.
wide. With only 5 days to respond most Dyer Rd. residents went to the
meeting. Zone 7 would not tell how residents could get in or out with
our cars, trucks and equipment. Residents did tell Zone 7 that closing
the road would cause unresolved problems that it was Zone 7
responsibility to resolve.<br>
The problems are once the road is closed the county will allow more
construction time than Zone 7 is saying could be 6 months or more,
additional 2 hour commute time in traffic, long response time for
emergency services including but not limited to vetenary needed for
horses cattle and sheep. There is more than 36 residents, 70 horses,
800 cattle, 50 sheep.The ever present threat of windmill fires.&nbsp;
General emergency medical response for residents. &lt;&gt;G&amp;C
Stable
has 40 horses with lessons daily and horses hauled in and out on a
daily basis. No mail service. Long commutes to work and
school.&lt;&gt;&nbsp;
Mr. Bailey makes 6 trips a day to Livermore his wife is in a nersing
home this will be a hardship for him. Residents with a class 1 license
will not be able to commute and get home within the 12 hour D.O.T.
rule. We need access to the full road in order to get in and out of our
drive ways with long horse and equipment trucks and trailors. The board
ignored Dyer Rd. comments refused to extend comment time and passed the
addendum to EIR.<br>
Altamont Pass Road and Dyer Rd. could be up graded to accomidate
construction of a pipeline without road clousure or continue with the
old E.I.R. with out the addendum. <br>
This total lack of concern for Dyer Rd. residents can not be tolerated.
Dyer Rd. residents will now seek a remidy within the legal system.<br>

gets the land! In the mean time Zone&nbsp; Water is gong to build a
water treatment plant to service Dublin &amp; Livermore but NO water or
fire hydrants for Altamont. SO MUCH FOR AGREEMENTS!<br>

<p>Altamont Landowners Against Rural Mismanagement was originally
formed
because of Los Vaqueros project, Contra Costa Water Department wanted
to
relocate Vasco Rd. through Dyer Rd. Our effort helped to relocate Vasco
Rd.
to the more direct, County Line route saving the environmental damages
to
Brushy Creek , Dyer Rd., and Altamont Pass Rd.<br>
<br>
Since the late 80's we have voiced concern's over, The large numbers of
protected species that have been killed at the Altamont Pass. Raptor
mortality by windmills, Windmills placed in raptor habitat, Waste
Management and U.S. Windpower's erection of windmills on the buffer
zone between the dump and Dyer Rd., Realignment of Altamont Pass Rd.,
at Carrol Rd. Expansions of Waste Management Altamont Hills, Contra
Costa County imports, Water quality, health, property values and land
fill traffic.<br>
<br>
We are trying to perserve our way of life and environment, at The
Altamont Pass. We are also very concerned and want to perserve property
owners rights. Altamont Pass has a very small population due inpart to
large parcel zoning of Alameda County. The Altamont Pass area of
windmills is 80 sq. miles.<br>
<br>
Altamont Landowners Against Rural Mismanagement is a Nevada
Corporation. All information is belived to be accurate information .
This information
is a matter of public record, and we can only guarantee that. We want
the
public to become aware of what is going on today. This is a volunteer
effort.
