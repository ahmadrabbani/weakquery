People see windmills and "say look at this it's renewableenergy now that's good!" The fact is it looks good on the outside but is rotten to the core on the inside.This industry cannot operate with out lots of support in the form of production tax credits, and other rip off's cheep production of power is not their goal. California Energy Plan 2/15/2002 10,000 windmills produced an insignificant amount of energy. The installed 1,000 MW can only be counted as 200 MW of dependable capacity. This lead to blackouts and business flight out of the state. The Recall Governor Elect  Arnold Schwarzenegger could have helped the junk bond rating of Calif. and the deficit spending on by backing down from renewable energy plans of EX Governor Gray Davis. Millions of wasteful spending to renew the broken down windmills and add massive new huge monsters to suck revenue out of the state. Florida light and Power has been a real big player buying up defunk windmill companies, and cashing in on the wright off's and production tax credits, which the Bush Administration continues to fund for renewable energy.  Drop the  Gov. Arnold a email a tell him  what is going on with his renewable energy program. Having rate payers put in solar panels the most expensive type of power out their to install, so they can sell it back to the utility, only though subsidies can this happen.      Altamont_Pass, Ca.   A brief summery of Altamont Pass largest Golden Eagle breeding area in the world.  The fact is Altamont got the Windmills and Alameda County Supervisors refused to listed to the facts.

I wrote many letters to Alameda County and Contra Costa County and other counties to make them aware of the statement, and they ignored this statement. Does this mean that Alameda County ignored killing of Golden Eagles and other raptors?  There response along with Contra Costa County has been to stall with studies. And when the studies came back then more studies. All along the killing continues.  The Counties position now is away from 2 year conditional use permits and to issue long term permits and the killing still goes on.       Altamont Pass story with letters and supporting facts.

Windmills do Kill Eagles December 1989, Page  1 .,  2 .,  3 .,  4 .  Delta Airlines magazine Sky June 1990, this is the usual story that makes people feel so good about windmills. There is little said about the environmental damage, visual and noise impacts local people have to deal with.  Page 4  People that write pro windmill articles should include information about the damage to the environment. The Golden Eagle below had her wing and head cut off by the windmills in the background.It is impossible to tell how many hundreds of birds and protected species have been killed at the windmill sights.  GOLDEN EAGLE KILLED BY COLLISION WITH WINDMILL  P.G.&E. WINDMILL DEMOLISHED 1989 P.G.&E.  proved that large wimdmills had big problems. The bearings that supported the blades would not hold up. There was two of these giant windmills built and were taken down with explosives and scraped. California utility customers paid for this folly. I wrote to United States Dept of The Interior Fish and Wild Service about the problem, raptors and protected species getting killed by windmills. Please look at the dates and remember that there is newpaper articles like the Independent front page of  July 5, 1989 that says eagles are getting killed by windmills at Altamont. Residents object to more windmills Tribune  July 30, 1989 . The  Letter from USFWS 4/90  is their reply to the problem. Notice the date of the reply. I wrote to Senator Pete Wilson. The Senator wrote the service. The  Letter to Senator Pet Wilson from USFWS 6/90  their reply to the problem. USFWS knew all the information contained in the Biosystems reports.  Biosystems report 89-90  front ,  Biosystems report 89-90 back Herald story  7/4/90 Wind Farm Bird Deaths , Ban on New Sites Feared. Please notice the date and what they say of the problem.  Letter from Senator Pete Wilson 7/90  to Darryl Mueller about the problem. One of other ignored problem that flies in the face of the environment is the gear oil leakage from the windmills. Windmills like these show signs of oil leakage, notice how the back side of the blade is brown and the dark line on the back edge where  oil runs down the blade and goes into the environment. This oil is toxic to the cattle that are grazing on the grass below.  Biosystems report 89-90 front  * This information was available and the problem was ignored.  Biosystems report 89-90 back  * This information was available and the problem was ignored.  The  Draft Biosystems report 60 Eagles kill 3/92  * This information is being ignored.  Final Biosystems report 39 eagles 3/92  * Notice how the final report changes the number of eagles killed*  U.S. Windpower presents $100,000.00 to Director of US Fish and Wildlife Service, John Turner, who gives the check to The Peregrine Fund. The Founding Chairman and Director Tom J. Cade has worked on several studies to resolve the Raptor Problem.  Wind turbines generate power at high cost to electric consumers. Customers to P.G.&E. pay higher utilility bills to off set the cost of wind generated elictricty. Read the newspaper article from the Times,  Cogen Energy Burns Consumers  2/93. 4% Alternative energy cost two times more than 75% of the power generated. Why should this be allowed to continue, with high cost to consumers and the killing of Golden Eagles and other raptors? Does anybody see a problem ?

NEWS PAPER COVERAGE of The Lawsuit     California Energy Plan  2/12/02 This is important because it admits how unreliable windenergy is and lead to blackouts. 1000 megawats is only worth is counted as 250 megawats. California could produce real cheep power. California's continues to spend millions of California's utility users money on this non reliable form of power. With the heavy spending that Gray Davis did and no concern for cheep and reliable  energy California had power blackouts. We were hoping that this wreckless give away of money would stop. With the 2003 Special Recall Election Gray Davis, supported and backed by California Unions was thrown out of office.   Govenor  Arnold Schwarzenegger could make a difference, and spend money into affordable reliable generation of power. Instead programs to renew windmills, and put solor pannels systems on houses continues.  The cost of this to produce power is off the charts and is funded by Public Utility Programs it can't support it's self. Only with Production Tax Credits and other Subsidies can it operate. The end result higher taxes to pay for the programs. 1.5 cents per kw. conventional power, aulternive's power can range 6 or more times.       The Montana Battle  Against U.S. Windpower  A phone call one night from Ron Wiggins a Rancher in Big Timber, Montana saying, "US Windpower wants to put windmills here in Montana, at Browning, Livingston, Glacier and Yellowstone, can you help us?" YES,we will help! Over the months that followed many phone calls and faxes were sent from The Altamont Pass to Big Timber Montana. The people won the battle in Montana, and we have some of the newspaper headlines and letters. When the truth is told wind energy can not stand on its own.  Letter from  Ray Suiter to N.W.P.P.C.

Here are some  excerpts from the introduction (Page 1):  “ The California Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), established…in 2002, calls for the state’s investor owned utilities (IOUs), energy service providers (ESPs), and community choice aggregators (CCAs) to meet 20 percent of their electricity load with eligible sources of renewable energy by 2017.”  “Much has already been accomplished…the state’s three major IOUs…have recently signed a large number of contracts for renewable energy capacity…if each of these new projects achieves commercial operations, total deliveries could equate to 3.1 to 5.4 percent of IOUs’ combined 2004 electricity load.”  “Nonetheless, the state as a whole has fallen behind schedule in meeting its aggressive renewable energy targets, and few new renewable energy projects have achieved commercial operation over the last several years.”  “Though a number of procurement strategies can be used to reduce the risk of contract failure, even these strategies cannot eliminate the possibility of unfulfilled contracts, and some of these strategies may have the unfortunate effect of reducing the number of renewable energy bids and raising bid prices.”   *         *         *         *      I always find it refreshing to see a few FACTS mixed in with the massive flow of information on “renewables” – which information is usually dominated by propaganda from the renewables industries, PUCs and other government agencies, national “laboratories” such as NREL, other "renewables" advocates and lobbyists (often funded by tax dollars flowing through DOE and EPA).

Unlike the others they have no commercial interest and their technical papers are amongst the best we've found on the net.   British Wind Energy Association:  Fiercely defensive about their industry, in particular it would appear that Country Guardian are a real thorn in their side. The BWEA doesn't seem to have any control over its members but only seems to fulfill some kind of publicity agents role.   Group 25  are campaigning to prevent the development of the Wharrels Hill area near Bothel in West Cumbria. A new website that is being added to all the time.   European Wind Energy Association  : Again very defensive but has some useful reference documents. Has a 'secret' area for members only!   Weardale Preservation . The beautiful countryside of Weardale is being devastated by the construction of wind turbines, for more details on the campaign in this area of the country visit this web site.   Danish Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association  : Obviously very hot on denying the noise problem but full of useful facts and figures. Try out their noise agree with what we have experienced!   Makara Guardians  . The people of New Zealand also have a problem with the threat of wind turbines invading their country. Visit this site and sign on to their petition to help protect their beautiful land.   Views of Angus  . "Renewable Energy Systems" are proposing to erect a wind power station on Ark Hill near Glamis, find out what the people of Angus think about this idea.   The Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales  . Sadly for them the good people of Wales have suffered from the blight of turbines more than most. The CPRW web site is a good source of information for data concerning power outputs of turbines based on actual values rather than the theoretical values touted by the wind industry. A really well informed site with lots of useful stuff -  and in Welsh too (if you want!).   The Cefn Croes Campaign  . Another Welsh campaign, this time fighting a proposal for a huge 39 x 1.5MW station near Aberystwyth in Mid Wales.   Denbighshire Against Rural Turbines.  (DART).  A fight to protect another area of rural Wales from the blight of turbines has been given a boost by this website. You can visit them and sign an on-line petition.   The German website (mostly in German too)  . Has some very technical articles on wind energy and global warming. Also has lots of photographs and loads of links to other sites.   Weiperfelden.de  Another German site with lots of pages of technical information and a discussion forum. Has links to other sites around Europe.   The Damstadt Manifesto   The Battle at Barningham High Moor  from being covered with wind turbines was  a lengthy and hard fought case, finally resulting in defeat for National Wind Power. Read the full story of the struggle at www.wind-farm.co.uk   Altamont Landowners Against Rural Mismanagement battle with the Megadump   Megadump   MTBE  Senator  Barbara Boxer wants the EPA to check it out after a year of letters  Facts Sheet  do we need a bigger dump  Altamont Dump a Pit, "Herald" 1/97  Standards of waste are going to be relaxed, "AFTER the FACT " Herald 3/97  Waste Management Operates in Violation of their CPU with Mud on roads  Livermore will sue to stop Altamont Landfill expansion plans,  Independent 6/97  After the "Great" Alameda County Board of Supervisors passed on the 80 million ton mega dump. Searra Club, NCRA, ALARM, Pleasanton and Livermore sued Waste Managenent to stop the expansion. ALARM found out about the settlement in the newspaper. This behind closed door settlement gives Livermore a 40 million ton mega dump, pays Livermore 50 million to dump on their over the hill Altamont neighbors.  Dump September 28, 1999             ZONE 7 WATER BOARD PLANS INVASION OF DYER ROAD IS APPROVED JUNE 20, 2001 <>Dyer Road Families oppose Zone 7,  Altamont Water Treatment Plant that would supply water to Livermore, Dublin & Pleasanton. No water for Altamont families. This treatment plant and pipeline cost is paid for by the developers. No cost to Zone 7. Altamont families think it makes more sense to build smaller plants in the development areas, this does not need to be built on Dyer Rd. At the very least Dyer Road families should get water. No fire hydrants, Yes Zone 7 plans to dig up Dyer Rd. install a new water line 42 inch in diameter and will not give Dyer Rd. water or fire protection.  The EIR was certified 2/05 by Zone 7 water board.  Zone 7 Water Board wants to change the E.I.R. with addendum, for Altamont Pass Pipeline.   On 2/10/06 some Dyer Rd. residents get a notice of addendum to changes E.I.R. And that on 2/15/06, 5 days, changes to Zone 7 EIR would be presented to the board.  Zone 7 had email and phone numbers but chose regulat mail.  Changes include close of Altamont Pass Rd. for pipiline construction,  moving the pipeline into Dyer Rd. which is 20 ft. wide. With only 5 days to respond most Dyer Rd. residents went to the meeting. Zone 7 would not tell how residents could get in or out with our cars, trucks and equipment. Residents did tell Zone 7 that closing the road would cause unresolved problems that it was Zone 7 responsibility to resolve. The problems are once the road is closed the county will allow more construction time than Zone 7 is saying could be 6 months or more, additional 2 hour commute time in traffic, long response time for emergency services including but not limited to vetenary needed for horses cattle and sheep. There is more than 36 residents, 70 horses, 800 cattle, 50 sheep.The ever present threat of windmill fires.  General emergency medical response for residents. <>G&C Stable has 40 horses with lessons daily and horses hauled in and out on a daily basis. No mail service. Long commutes to work and school.<>  Mr. Bailey makes 6 trips a day to Livermore his wife is in a nersing home this will be a hardship for him. Residents with a class 1 license will not be able to commute and get home within the 12 hour D.O.T. rule. We need access to the full road in order to get in and out of our drive ways with long horse and equipment trucks and trailors. The board ignored Dyer Rd. comments refused to extend comment time and passed the addendum to EIR. Altamont Pass Road and Dyer Rd. could be up graded to accomidate construction of a pipeline without road clousure or continue with the old E.I.R. with out the addendum.  This total lack of concern for Dyer Rd. residents can not be tolerated. Dyer Rd. residents will now seek a remidy within the legal system.   <> Go for more Info to  Dyer Rd.   A Lake for drinking water next next to garbage dump?    Now the California Department of Water Resources will take land between the Mega Dump and the few rural families to build a large lake. In the settlement agreement this land was to be a buffer zone between the rural families and the dump. DWR response was the first one their gets the land! In the mean time Zone  Water is gong to build a water treatment plant to service Dublin & Livermore but NO water or fire hydrants for Altamont. SO MUCH FOR AGREEMENTS!  ABOUT A.L.A.R.M.    Altamont Landowners Against Rural Mismanagement was originally formed because of Los Vaqueros project, Contra Costa Water Department wanted to relocate Vasco Rd. through Dyer Rd. Our effort helped to relocate Vasco Rd. to the more direct, County Line route saving the environmental damages to Brushy Creek , Dyer Rd., and Altamont Pass Rd. Since the late 80's we have voiced concern's over, The large numbers of protected species that have been killed at the Altamont Pass. Raptor mortality by windmills, Windmills placed in raptor habitat, Waste Management and U.S. Windpower's erection of windmills on the buffer zone between the dump and Dyer Rd., Realignment of Altamont Pass Rd., at Carrol Rd. Expansions of Waste Management Altamont Hills, Contra Costa County imports, Water quality, health, property values and land fill traffic. We are trying to perserve our way of life and environment, at The Altamont Pass. We are also very concerned and want to perserve property owners rights. Altamont Pass has a very small population due inpart to large parcel zoning of Alameda County. The Altamont Pass area of windmills is 80 sq. miles. Altamont Landowners Against Rural Mismanagement is a Nevada Corporation. All information is belived to be accurate information .
