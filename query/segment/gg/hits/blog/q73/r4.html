                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003300">AUSTIN, 
                  Texas, Jan. 10 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Whole Foods 
                  Market (Nasdaq:WFMI), the world's leading natural 
                  and organic foods supermarket, has made a landmark 
                  purchase of renewable energy credits from wind farms 
                  to offset 100% of the electricity used in all of 
                  its stores, facilities, bake houses, distribution 
                  centers, regional offices and national headquarters 
                  in the United States and Canada. This is the largest 
                  wind energy credit purchase in the history of the 
                  United States and Canada and makes Whole Foods Market 
                  the only Fortune 500 Company purchasing wind energy 
                  credits to offset 100% of its electricity use.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003300">&quot;Whole 
                  Foods Market is a leader in the natural and organic 
                  foods movement, and that involves caring about our 
                  communities and respecting our environment. This 
                  purchase of wind energy credits is a natural extension 
                  of that leadership and is integral to our core values,&quot; 
                  said Michael Besancon, Whole Foods Market Southern 
                  Pacific regional president and Green Mission task 
                  force leader. &quot;Offsetting 100% of our electricity 
                  use with renewable, clean energy strengthens our 
                  commitment to be a leader in environmental stewardship 
                  by helping to clean the air and reducing our dependence 
                  on fossil fuels.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003300">As 
                  of December 9, 2005, Whole Foods Market is purchasing 
                  more than 458,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) of renewable 
                  energy credits from wind farms. This purchase will 
                  avoid more than 700 million pounds of carbon dioxide 
                  pollution this year. To have the same environmental 
                  impact, more than 60,000 cars would have to be taken 
                  off the road or more than 90,000 acres of trees 
                  would have to be planted.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003300">&quot;Whole 
                  Foods Market has made the largest ever corporate 
                  purchase of renewable energy credits in the nation,&quot; 
                  said Kurt Johnson, U.S. Environmental Protection 
                  Agency Green Power Partnership director. &quot;Conventional 
                  electricity generation is the largest industrial 
                  source of air pollution in the United States, and 
                  wind power is a clean and renewable alternative. 
                  Whole Foods Market's commitment to wind power is 
                  providing an outstanding example of environmental 
                  leadership.&quot;<br />
                  Renewable energy credits make nationwide wind power 
                  transactions possible since it would be physically 
                  impossible to deliver electrons from a wind farm 
                  directly to all of Whole Foods Market's stores, 
                  facilities, and businesses. When a wind farm produces 
                  electricity, renewable energy credits are issued 
                  to track the exact amount of power created.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003300">Whole 
                  Foods Market has chosen Boulder, Colorado-based 
                  Renewable Choice Energy as its exclusive supplier 
                  of renewable energy credits after an extensive search 
                  process. Renewable Choice Energy is a leading national 
                  provider, building the market for clean and renewable 
                  sources of energy. &quot;Renewable Choice Energy 
                  is thrilled to have been chosen to make this record- 
                  setting renewable energy credit purchase possible,&quot; 
                  said Quayle Hodek, Renewable Choice Energy chief 
                  executive officer. &quot;Whole Foods Market's commitment 
                  is an inspiration to everyone looking for a leader 
                  to demonstrate that wind power is ready for the 
                  mainstream.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003300">To 
                  help evaluate options and facilitate the purchasing 
                  process, Whole Foods Market involved the Washington, 
                  DC-based nonprofit environmental think tank World 
                  Resources Institute (WRI). Since 2000, WRI has been 
                  working with a number of Fortune 500 companies to 
                  increase their use of renewable energy. &quot;By 
                  making this purchase, Whole Foods Market is taking 
                  a huge step toward advancing corporate renewable 
                  energy purchases,&quot; said Jonathan Lash, WRI 
                  president. &quot;Corporate leadership is essential 
                  to the growth of wind power, and Whole Foods Market's 
                  historic purchase has set a new benchmark for the 
                  industry.&quot;</font></p>
