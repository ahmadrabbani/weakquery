MIKE NELSON/EPA    SAG Awards 2011 red carpet worst dressed gallery (6 photos)             Newsflash: Strolling the red carpet at the  2011 Screen Actors Guild Awards ,  Helena Bonham Carter did not appear to have gotten dressed in the dark ... in the costume closet ... of Klown Kollege, so we'll have to make do with mocking a few other worthy contenders. Now "Boardwalk Empire" star  Michael Pitt looked just fine from the chin down, but he sported the greasiest locks since ...   Annette Bening  at the Golden Globes .  Melissa Leo of "The Fighter": Far too shiny.  Angie Harmon of "Rizzoli and Isles": Far too frilly.  Jenna Fischer of "The Office": Didn't you get a promotion on the show? Why are you still dressing like a secretary, albeit a real fancy one? "Rabbit Hole" star  Nicole Kidman . Butt bow. 'Nuff said. And  Lauren Velez , the "Dexter" detective? That gown is an indictable offense.
