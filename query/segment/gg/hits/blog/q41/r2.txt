Front-runners coasted to victory at Sunday's Screen Actors Guild Awards - lead performers Colin Firth as Queen Elizabeth II's stuttering dad in "The King's Speech" and Natalie Portman as a ballerina going off her rocker in "Black Swan," plus supporting players Christian Bale as a boxer on the skids and Melissa Leo as his doting but domineering mother in "The Fighter."   "The King's Speech" also won the SAG award for overall acting ensemble. A day earlier, the film was an upset winner at the Directors Guild of America Awards, where its filmmaker Tom Hooper triumphed over David Fincher, who had been considered the favorite for "The Social Network."  Celebritology gives a list of the  snubs and surprises at this year's SAG Awards. Here is a selection:  The SAG Award Surprises   Betty White wins for best actress in a TV comedy: "Hot in Cleveland" isn't the kind of show that generally finds itself drowning in accolades. Even though we're talking about the much beloved, 89-year-old White here, it was still something of a surprise to see America's favorite grandma take the Actor instead of Jane Lynch, Tina Fey, Sofia Vergara or Edie Falco.  "The King's Speech" wins best ensemble: Not a jaw-dropping moment but significant since the SAGs are focused on acting and not other elements of a production. Because of that, some suspected that "The Fighter" cast would triumph. But with this win, a Directors Guild victory for "King's Speech" director Tom Hooper and a Producers Guild award for best picture, the awards season momentum has officially swung toward "King's Speech" and away from "The Social Network."  The SAG Award Snubs   "Glee": Jane Lynch, Chris Colfer and the ensemble were all ignored while awards instead went to White, Alec Baldwin and the cast of "Modern Family." Lynch's loss may have been the most shocking given her track (suit) record of consistent victories.  "Mad Men": The AMC period piece has won the prize for best TV drama ensemble for the past two years. The streak was broken Sunday night, courtesy of a big win for "Boardwalk Empire."  Jen Chaney also made a list of the  best and worst dressed celebrities at the SAG Awards:      CONTINUED         1     2         Next  >         © 2011 The Washington Post Company       Featured Advertiser Links  mesothelioma cancer shatters lives.
