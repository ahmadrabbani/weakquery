And no one does awkward red-carpet banter better than the people at E! As proof, here are some of the more stellar moments from last night's   SAG Awards  pregame show. Tracy Morgan brings a couple pockets full of crazy to his interview with   Giuliana Rancic  , which culminates with his declaration that Sarah Palin is "the hottest MILF in the world," the natural follow-up to his   comments about the former Alaska governor last week on TNT  . Somehow Rancic missed that whole controversy, and her confusion only adds to the hilarity.    John Krasinski gets his feelings hurt, reveals that Rancic is actually animatronic and completely wins the hearts of every red-carpet-show viewer in America.

(Happy birthday, Mr. Timberlake, and thank you for making the red-carpet proceedings delightfully absurd.)    James Franco raises the question "Twitter, really?" then dares to answer it intelligently.    Julie Bowen also raises another important question, this one re: her pantsuit: "Is it dicey?" For the record,   we say no  .    And lastly, as definitive evidence that Christian Bale does not have anger-management issues, he awkwardly engages in a red-carpet interview with Rancic without throttling her or anyone else associated with E!     2011 01 31 10 40 By  Jen Chaney   | January 31, 2011; 10:40 AM ET   Categories:   Awards Season             Save & Share:                                                    Previous:  Eva Longoria and Tony Parker officially divorced Next:  Tom Hanks arrives on Facebook.
