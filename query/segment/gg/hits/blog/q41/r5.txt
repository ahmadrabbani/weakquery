Tweet            Screen Actors Guild Awards handed out the Best Actress in Comedy category to  Betty White . Not counting last year's lifetime achievement honor, this is the first SAG for the 89-year-old. "We (the cast of  Hot in Cleveland ) fell in love the first day we worked together," White who plays a sassy housekeeper on the TV Land's comedy said. She cracked a joke, "You didn't applaud when I turned 40."  White's win was the first genuine surprise at the Sunday, January 30 event. She beat favorite-to-win such as  Jane Lynch of " Glee " and  Sofia Vergara of " Modern Family " but "Modern" got its revenge right after. The ABC comedy was named Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series.  Ed O'Neill chose to deliver the speech and he kept it short, saying, "This is one that I think we all wanted."  "Glee", which had its glory at Golden Globes earlier this month, officially is not getting some love from SAG. Earlier that night,  Alec Baldwin from " 30 Rock " beat  Chris Colfer in the race for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series.  Over in the drama category, " Boardwalk Empire " was the clear winner. Beside named Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series, the HBO show also delivered victory for its leading star  Steve Buscemi . The other drama acting nod went to  Julianna Margulies of " The Good Wife ".
