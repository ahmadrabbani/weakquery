"Their commitment will expose thousands of students to music education who may not otherwise have the opportunity." Funds provided by Music Empowers will be used specifically to match contributions made by individual donors to eligible classroom music projects, under a DonorsChoose.org program called "Double Your Impact." "Once individual donations total 50% of a music project's cost, Music Empowers will fund the other 50%," explained  Andy Davis , founder of Music Empowers Foundation.  "If all goes well, we should be able to fund hundreds of these projects and make a real impact in schools where music programs are struggling due to lack of funds." Kris Allen recently attended Nickelodeon's NickTeen HALO Awards on behalf of Music Empowers and DonorsChoose.org and voiced his support for the joint initiative.  "I think DonorsChoose.org is an amazing resource for helping teachers to get the materials they need to do the best job for their students. I am really happy to partner with Music Empowers Foundation to support them and the music teachers and students who will benefit," said Mr. Allen. In an effort to encourage people to visit the DonorsChoose.org website and contribute to one of the projects eligible for the Music Empowers Foundation matching funds,  Kris Allen recorded a special  public service announcement which now is airing on television. As revealed in the PSA, he also will be growing a mustache over the next four weeks as a further incentive for his fans to help out.
