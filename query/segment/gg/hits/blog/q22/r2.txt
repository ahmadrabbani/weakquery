And Casey Abrams was very emotional on stage when given the news that despite getting the least amount of votes, the three judges were going to let him stay on. He slipped onto his knees, grabbed his head and was trembling with disbelief at his good fortune.  All too much: An emotional Casey Abrams reportedly collapsed backstage and began hyperventilating after being saved by the American Idol judges     Crumbled: The drama continued off stage when Abrams became so overwrought with emotion he had to be helped onto a chair by the show's staffers   But it appears the drama did not end on stage and continued behind the scenes as well. Abrams was so overwrought with emotion after the show that he apparently began hyperventilating and then crumbled onto the floor in the hallway. TMZ are reporting that American Idol staffers had to help Casey up and put him in a chair so he could sit down and catch his nerves. It seems ironic that his save song choice on Thursday was I Don't Need No Doctor - it clearly appeared that he did.      Ironic: The singer's save song on Thursday night was I Don't Need No Doctor - but clearly he did and Jennifer Lopez was stunned at the results of the vote     Lucky: Abrams received the least amount of votes and was headed home but was saved by Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez and Randy Jackson   An insider told the site that Casey feels guilty that the judges used the only save of the season on keeping him on the hit TV show. 'I feel really bad that other [contestants] might have to go home now because they [the judges] used the save on me'. Abrams has had ongoing health problems and even had to have a blood transfusion on Thursday morning because of ongoing issues he suffers with internal bleeding. Judges Randy Jackson, Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler dramatically decided to rescue the hairy singer from elimination in the emotional results show. But while nobody went home this week, the remaining 11 finalists are now at the mercy of the viewing public with the judges having used up the once chance to save a contestant.  Upset: Insiders say Abrams now feels guilty that the judges used the only save of the season on him meaning no one else will have the opportunity now if voted off   And host Ryan Seacrest announced the bombshell that now two contestants will be leaving the show next week because of the decision. Upon hearing news he had been saved, Casey collapsed to his knees and with shaking hands went to hug and thank the judges. 'Are you kidding? Are you really,' he squealed. The save card was brought in recently in a bid to give the judges the power to overrule the public decision. It can be implemented up until the top five contestants are eliminated and it must be a unanimous decision between the three judges.  Headed to the stools: Casey fell into the bottom three alongside Thia Megia and Stefano Langone   Casey, 20, fell into the bottom three alongside Thia Megia and Stefano Langone following their performances on Wednesday night's Motown live show. On Wednesday's programme, Casey performed a rousing rendition of the Marvin Gaye classic I Heard It Through The Grapevine. However he only made it half way through his save song before Randy dramatically stopped him, saying the audience didn't need convincing that he was a star singer. He called it 'crazy' that Abrams was in danger of being booted from the show. 'We've made a decision together here,'Tyler said. 'We're going to keep you.' A shocked Lopez added 'We were wondering what was going on and why you were in the bottom and we don't know.  Money maker: Casey's save also means that he will be able to be a part of the summer tour that the top 10 contestants enjoy   'You've had a rough couple of weeks and a lot of stuff going on but we want you to get back to the artist you are. You deserve to be here!' Earlier in the contest, Casey missed one of the results show after being rushed to hospital for two blood transfusions. The drama came in the first week of the live shows with the hopeful being taken to Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after suffering crippling stomach pains. Casey suffers from the condition ulcerative colitis - a form of irritable bowel disease - which causes sores on the colon and intestine.  The singers still in the running along with Abrams are Lauren Alaina, Paul McDonald, Pia Toscano, James Durbin, Jacob Lusk, Haley Reinhart, Thia Megia, Stefano Langone, Naima Adedapo and Scotty McCreery.      Print this article   Read later   Email to a friend   Share this article:   Facebook    Twitter    Digg it    Newsvine    Delicious    MySpace    Nowpublic    Reddit             Comments ( 19 )  Here's what readers have had to say so far.

American Idol has become a nauseating lovefest." - SO correct about that, georgehr3.  - Kate, New York, USA, 27/3/2011 19:38 Click to rate        Rating     50   Report abuse   Just because he doesnt have the 'full package', doesnt mean he is being discriminated against because of the way he looks. Stefano and Thia are both very talented singers and Casey, although he can sing, his performances start sounding all the same to me. If you actually bother to listen to Stefano sing, you can see he has an amazing range. This year's American Idol contestants are a league above any line up they have ever had on X Factor. That means some talented people are going to have to go home. - random, newcastle, 27/3/2011 17:32 Click to rate        Rating     21   Report abuse   Not sure why he was saved, he's good but not worth throwing their only life saver for. Let's hope Jacob doesn't get voted off by the public, that would be the real loss. - mim, London, 27/3/2011 17:09 Click to rate        Rating     38   Report abuse   DRAMA QUEEN!!! - Katherine, Manchester, UK, 27/3/2011 16:05 Click to rate        Rating     43   Report abuse   I don't understand how Naima Adedapo IS STILL THERE and a guy as amazing as Casey was voted out! - Amelja, NY, 27/3/2011 14:38 Click to rate        Rating     39   Report abuse   Poor Casey. I couldn't believe he ended up in the bottom 3. I really thought Thia would've had the least votes instead and would've left the show. - Alex, London, 27/3/2011 14:37 Click to rate        Rating     37   Report abuse     The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.
