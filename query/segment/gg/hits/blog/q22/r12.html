<p><strong>And the Winner of American Idol Season 10 is Scotty McCreery</strong></p>
<p>HOLY MOLY. From Worst. Final. Evah. to BEST FINALE EVAAHHHH!  Congratulations Mr. Nigel Lygoe on a job well done. Season 10 had some bumps in the road, including ineffectual judging, over-produced performances and tired themes, but you put on one hell of a finale. It was definitely the best Season ender since Taylor Hicks and Kat McPhee battled it out in 2006.</p>
<p>Where to begin with the awesomeness? I looked at my watch at one point, and it was already 9:30.  The show was well paced, the Top 5 matched up with talent that complimented the Idol&#8217;s strengths. There were bits that were ACTUALLY LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY. Group performances were well choreographed and entertaining. The presence of joke contestants were kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>As some of you mentioned in comments, the back end was loaded with non-Idol performances&#8211;some of which weren&#8217;t all that entertaining (I&#8217;m a U2 fan, but The Edge and Bono&#8217;s &#8220;Spiderman&#8221; musical looks like a real snore) but that&#8217;s it for criticisms, really. Although the final result wasn&#8217;t all that surprising&#8211;yeah Scotty won, just like we knew he would&#8211;the show as a whole was a reminder of how talented the Top 13 were as a whole. I had almost forgotten about that.</p>
<p>Really good to see again were: <strong>Karen Rodriguez</strong> (I KNOW! But her solos were awesome), <strong>Casey Abrams</strong>, <strong>Naima Adedapo</strong>,  Stefano Langone. <strong>JAMES DURBIN</strong> AND HIS SIRENS. Oh crap. I was pretty happy to see everyone back together again.</p>
<p>Now Nigel has to sit down (like he did at the end of SYTYCD last season) and figure out what worked, and what did not work this season, in order to make Season 11 truly the Best Season of Idol EVAH!</p>
<p>Live blogging the American Idol 10 FINALE!  Who will win <em>American Idol</em> Season 10. We&#8217;ll find out after two hours of performances. See the list <a title="American Idol Finale Week: Facts AND Rumors (NEW ADDITIONS)" href="http://mjsbigblog.com/american-idol-finale-week-facts-and-rumors.htm" >HERE</a>.  GET READY.</p>
<p>WHO DO YOU LOVE? This is <em>American Idol</em>!  Over 122 million votes last night. Almost 3/4 of a billion votes amassed over the season. Wow. That&#8217;s some major power voting going on!   After introducing the judges, Ryan brings  The Top 2,  <strong>Lauren Alaina</strong> and <strong>Scotty McCreery</strong> center stage. They walk down the stairs dressed in white, holding hands. Aw. Just like angels!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for shots of the finalists hometowns. And they are off to get ready for the show.</p>
<p>POINTY POSE! <strong>The Top 13</strong> sing &#8220;Born This Way&#8221; Contestants making googly eyes to the camera.  Kudos to  <strong>Napoleon and Tabitha</strong> for choreographing a fun routine for the contestants. Everyone sounds and looks GOOD. &#8211; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_zAqZE39R0" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);"><strong>VIDEO</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>James Durbin</strong> and <strong>JUDAS PRIEST</strong> join forces! Lulz at James outfit. He looks like he&#8217;s about to go out cruisin&#8217; with the Village People.  So. Yeah. Uhm. Give metal a chance, y&#8217;all. ROCK SCREAMS FOR THE WIN. SIRENS.- <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tarP6KVMzz4" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">VIDEO</a></strong></p>
<p>Next up: Video clip ragging on <strong>Randy Jackson</strong>.  Now they are mocking &#8220;In It To Win It&#8221;. I wonder how many times Randy has actually said that throughout the season? Somebody in production needs to tally that up. &#8220;We got to get you a new writer,&#8221; says Ryan</p>
<p><strong>Jacob Lusk</strong> and gospel star <strong>Kirk Franklin</strong> take the stage to sing &#8220;Smile&#8221;.  Here comes <strong>Gladys Knight</strong>! She&#8217;s Mormon btw (fun fact to know and tell.) This is pretty much a hot mess. Franklin is testifying about tornado victims&#8230;or something. Here comes the gospel choir.  Having said all that&#8211;Jacob is right in his element. &#8211; <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msj_wY-OiEc" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">VIDEO</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack Black</strong> takes the stage with <strong>Casey Abrams</strong> to sing &#8220;Fat Bottomed Girls&#8221;.   It&#8217;s funny, but not exactly a vocal showcase. Lots of fun vocal riffing.   Girls in short shorts take the stage to dance some sort of cheerleader routine. Oh my gosh&#8211;what a pair! Perfect.  That last frame will make an awesome screen shot. Kung Fu Panda comes out tomorrow! MOVIE PLUG. &#8211; <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31dL5NtlZts" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">VIDEO</a></strong></p>
<p>Ryan promises to get the results in before our dvrs stop. The ladies take the stage with <strong>Beyonce</strong> to sing &#8220;Single Ladies&#8221;. The girls sound good! Karen especially.  BOOM FIYAH! &#8220;If I Were A Boy&#8221;  Haley solo! Awesome. Oh&#8230;Check out Pia SINGING UPTEMPO like she should have during the competition. Beyonce enters to sing &#8220;Crazy in Love&#8221; with the girls backing her up.

<p>TIME FOR IDOL LOSERS. And we&#8217;re watching a clip of bad auditioners instead of a performance from <strong>Lee DeWyze</strong>? REALLY?</p>
<p>Next, it&#8217;s <strong>Marc Anthony</strong> singing some Spanish joint. I guess he&#8217;s written into Jlo&#8217;s contract. Yes? Karen Rodriguez needs to join him on stage.  Nope. Wifey <strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong> is joining him to perform a sexy sexy dance routine. Shake that booty Jlo!  <strong>Sheila E</strong>! DRUMS! That was hot. &#8211; <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dakY-dXWPk" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">VIDEO</a></strong></p>

<p>The Top 13 boys take the stage. <strong>Stefano</strong> does his best <strong>Prince</strong> falsetto on &#8220;Kiss&#8221; <strong>Paul McDonald</strong> sings &#8220;She&#8217;s a Lady&#8221; James &#8220;What&#8217;s New Pussycat&#8221; We know where this is going! Ha ha, James touches Casey&#8217;s nose when he sings &#8220;You and your pussycat nose&#8221;. Scotty sings &#8220;Green Green Grass of Home&#8221; Geez, there&#8217;s a song for EVERYBODY in the <strong>Tom Jones</strong> oeuvre! What a versatile guy.  Jacob sings &#8220;Delilah&#8221;. Casey growls through a verse as the boys swing in unison. The guys are so funny.  Best! Pointy! Pose! EVER! Tom himself takes the stage to sing &#8220;It&#8217;s Not Unusual&#8221;. He looks GREAT.

<p>The last <strong>Ford Music Video</strong> of the season is a montage of all the commercials with Lauren and Scotty singing &#8220;Whenever You Remember&#8221;.  Scotty and Lauren&#8217;s teachers are in the audience tonight. Oh. So the kids are giving cars to their teachers.

<p><strong>Lady Gaga</strong> takes the stage to sing her song &#8220;Edge of Glory&#8221;. She&#8217;s got some crazy beaded headress thingy on. She looks like a beaded  sphinx. Gaga has been on my nerves lately, but I dig this song. She takes off her cape to reveal a two piece outfit and a big cross necklace. She&#8217;s perched on what looks like a giant rock formation. HI SYTYCD <strong>Mark Kanemura</strong>! (He&#8217;s one of her dancers) <strong>Clarence Clemons</strong> stands in the fog below to accompany her on saxophone. &#8211; <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdgvoShI-24" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">VIDEO</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Lauren Alaina</strong> takes the stage to sing &#8220;Before He Cheats&#8221; she&#8217;s joined on stage by <strong>Carrie Underwood</strong>. Aw. They&#8217;re both so cute and sassy! Good chemistry. Carrie, generously, is being careful not to showboat that big ole voice of hers, but she still outsings Lauren by a country mile.  &#8211; <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROYr683RXtU" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">VIDEO</a></strong></p>
<p>Next Video: &#8220;<strong>We have two 6th graders in the competition, and they are kicking our ass</strong>&#8221; &#8211; Stefano. LOL. The other contestants talking about how young the Top 2 are. FUNNY. &#8211; <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXicxI7ggbg" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">VIDEO</a></strong></p>

WOWZERS. &#8211; <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYKPHv8L2Fw" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">VIDEO</a></strong></p>
<p>The Star of &#8220;Spiderman&#8221; joins <strong>The Edge</strong> and <strong>Bono</strong> to sing the song &#8220;Rise Above&#8221;. A dude is flying through the air in his SPIDEY costume. Please don&#8217;t fall. Oh. Trying so hard to save this failed musical. What a boring song.  <strong>Reeve Carney</strong>, the star of &#8220;Spiderman&#8221;  kind of looks like <strong>Kris Allen</strong>. Spidey dude almost falls on Jlo. That would have been something. &#8211; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vbwZ02ALoU" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);"><strong>VIDEO</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Steven Tyler</strong>, on stage, at the piano, singing &#8220;Dream On&#8221;. JLO ROCKING OUT. Actually, Steven sounds pretty awesome with a band behind him and an orchestra. He hits that high note like a champ. Wow. He has not lost his voice. The song is cut short, inexplicably right after &#8220;the scream.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZnQNtuwN5E" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);"><strong>VIDEO</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>RESULTS</strong>! Here comes <strong>Edward Boddington</strong> from Telescope&#8230; DIM THE LIGHTS HERE WE GO!!! And the winner of American Idol is&#8230;<strong>Scotty McCreery</strong>!  That was anti-climatic.  The judges and the Top 13 are all on stage with Scotty and Lauren.  Ryan announces Lauren Alaina as the runner-up. She&#8217;s smiling, looking happy.  Scotty says he and Lauren have been together since the beginning and they&#8217;ll always  be together.  After thanking the Lord, it&#8217;s time for Scotty to sing.</p>
<p><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/b0BTCU5umX8?version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/b0BTCU5umX8?version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="385" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>Now he gets to sing out with his crappy coronation song, &#8220;I Love You This Big&#8221;. He hugs Lauren.He hugs his family then hugs all the Top 13 and the judges individually. He&#8217;s not singing very much. He falls to floor, crying. He tries to catch confetti on his tongue! Lauren kisses him on the cheek over and over again.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, says Scotty. And we are out.</p>

<p>Aww!  I&#8217;m a west coaster that loves the spoilers!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited for tonight&#8217;s show!  I hope Stefano gets a duet or solo or some decent time on screen!  And I&#8217;m still holding out for some last minute switch up and James is pronounced the winner! hehe</p>

<p>Who?  Lauren?  Maybe it&#8217;s just me lacking the female chromosome, but I&#8217;ve really seen little wrong with anything she&#8217;s worn all year.  I don&#8217;t get the comments about her outfits&#8230;I think she&#8217;s looked fine.  But then again I have basically zero fashion sense and have never really cared to have any, lol.</p>

<p>Yeah ok, I didn&#8217;t hear that.  I mean, if Casey&#8217;s a comedian along with being a musician (and I think they&#8217;d said he&#8217;s quite the jokester), he could probably have a very similar career&#8230;but it&#8217;d be one I&#8217;d be much less likely to be interested in.</p>

<p>Nope, I haven&#8217;t.  Just saying that as a musician and music fan myself.  Tim&#8217;s voice actually sounded thinner than Scotty&#8217;s.  Could have been the TV sound, I dunno, but that&#8217;s what I heard.</p>
<p>And for that matter, keep in mind that I favor Lauren over Scotty so it&#8217;s not just bias for Scotty talking&#8230;</p>

Did I miss Lauren in the Beyonce tribute? Not sure she could sing or dance (or fit into one of those dresses) but maybe it’s just the live stream.&#8221;</p>
<p>yeah, it&#8217;s the comments like these that REALLY make me mad. it&#8217;s a singing competition, not a weight competition. people are just plain old rude. she&#8217;s only 16. have a little bit of respect, people. i don&#8217;t even think she&#8217;s THAT fat. a little chubby, sure, but she&#8217;s from the south. Ha, it&#8217;s kind of their culture a little bit. so, everyone, just shut up about people&#8217;s looks. it&#8217;s a SINGING competition. keep it that way.</p>

<p>I loathe the audition nonsense during the finale. It&#8217;s so mean.</p>
<p>And did J-Lo and Marc Anthony learn nothing from the disaster at the GRAMMYS a few years back? Marc is fine solo but J-Lo just isn&#8217;t talented enough to keep up.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s contestants have had a greater role than season 8&#8242;s. The medley&#8217;s are longer, while season 8, aside from Kris and Adam&#8217;s duets and the ending, was all about the contestants singing back up for the established talent.  I also like the funny skits that we&#8217;ve seen with this year&#8217;s cast.  My problem is the lack of former idols.</p>

<p>Since they are about to run out of time, does that mean Scotty (err, the to-be-announced winner) won&#8217;t have time to sing his winner&#8217;s song? Or are they not doing that as both finalists did their &#8220;singles&#8221; last night?</p>

<p>Lol we&#8217;re just on different pages tonight I guess. I made a comment here a minute ago but I guess it didn&#8217;t post.  I loved Beyonce&#8217;s song, and I really have never liked anything she&#8217;s done, at least that I&#8217;ve heard.  That was so full of emotion&#8230;I thought it was great.  Of course it also sounded like the sort of song that&#8217;s often the final track on an album and I frequently love those tracks, whereas a lot of people I think often are bored by the stripped down instrumentation.  I&#8217;m weird sometimes when it comes to music though, what can I say.</p>

<p>Really?? We&#8217;ve had 4 performances that had nothing to do with Idols at all, not even singing the introduction.  In Season 8 &#8211; were there any??  Season 8 you had the idols singing with Santana, the girls with Fergie, Lil had a duet with Queen Latifah, Danny had a duet with Lionel Richie, Allison had a duet with Cyndi Lauper, Michael Sarver and Megan sang with Steve Martin, the guys sang with Rod Stewart, Anoop and Alexis sang with Jason Mraz etc.</p>

As a Lauren fan I am happy with the ending as there would have been complaints if she won and now she can be the rightful runner-up with all the perks of the winner.  Also, Scotty made me a fan tonight, maybe not of his music but of the person, very mature for such a young age.</p>

<p>Nope, only Haley does that lol.  Have never seen anything but a sweet face on Lauren or tears.  Congrats to Scotty.  It was very nice of him to say that Lauren was with him from the beginning and they would still be together.  Guess so, as they will be label mates, tour mates and probably doing publicity together.  Being runner-up aint so bad.</p>

Very nice ending and all is right with the world. Scotty was very gracious and as I knew she would, Lauren handled herself with grace. You can tell that this a close knit group and that Lauren and Scotty are very close. As a Lauren fan I am happy with the ending as there would have been complaints if she won and now she can be the rightful runner-up with all the perks of the winner. Also, Scotty made me a fan tonight, maybe not of his music but of the person, very mature for such a young age.</p></blockquote>
<p>Agreed.  He seems like a great young man &#8211; gracious, polite and humble.  I wish him a great career &#8211; which unfortunately won&#8217;t get a kick start with that awful song.  I predict that Lauren will do well.  It might take a couple of years, but we will be hearing her on the radio &#8211; her voice records beautifully.</p>

<p>From what I have read on twitter, nothing would make their young fans happier.  They do seem sweet together and unless they are great actors, genuinely like each other.  Scotty seems very protective of Lauren and she looks at him for approval before she answers in interviews and seems to look up to him &#8211; it really is quite cute.</p>

<p>Awesome finale with an awesome result! Scotty is one talented, sweet, mature and classy guy! Loved his family throughout this too.</p>
<p>Best parts in order:<br />
1) Scotty&#8217;s &#8216;hugout&#8217;<br />
2) Tim McGraw and Scotty<br />
3) Steven Tyler!!!!!!!!!<br />

I was happy to see Gladys Knight (Motown) on again with Jacob. Nice job! James was looking like he had a ball – maybe they (Juda Priest) will have him as a Guest Singer sometime in the future? Honored to see Tony Bennett and Tom Jones perform. Loved the boys singing Tom’s songs! Beyonce was great as usual. Lady Gaga was unusual. LOL!   Enjoyed Marc Anthony with Jennifer.  So many great singers, but I still missed the alumni coming back to sing.</p>
<p>I loved seeing the friendship that developed between Scotty and Lauren. It’s funny because Lee made the comment about him and Crystal being together from the beginning – just like Scotty said. Oh, you do remember Lee, right? He’s the guy that won last year and was sitting behind Ryan as he spoke of the show. It would have been nice to see Ryan shake hands and ask, “How have you been buddy?” Better yet – let Lee sing!</p>
<p>My husband made the comment that it looked like Carrie was trying to outsing Lauren. I didn’t notice that, but with Lauren’s vocal problems or not, that would be easy to do.</p>
<p>Did anyone see other American Idol winners there besides Lee and David Cook? I need to rewatch the show. So much going on – very fast paced!</p>
<p>I had Scotty third after Pia and James. I think he’s a sweet guy and I wish him well with his career! Congraulations to all the Scotty fans – and Lauren’s fans too!</p>

<p>Hard to compare Season 9 to 10 &#8211; so different (more money spent Season 10 judges and productions).  Best to Lee &amp; Crystal<br />

<p>I had the opposite impression. I thought Carrie held back in respect for Lauren&#8217;s vocal problems. Carrie&#8217;s usually a lot more powerful and growly on that song. </p>

<p>The point is, Lee won last season. The winner of the previous season has always come back to perform. Even Taylor Hicks performed after the year he won.</p>

Honestly I think I enjoyed this one more than any other AI finale from beginning to end. The quality of performances was really good and what a big affirmation of s10&#8242;s talent. I&#8217;m so happy the focus was mostly on s10. The only things I would&#8217;ve liked a little more of were: the support from the hometown watch parties and a Scotty/LaurenA duet. I guess them singing Whenever You Remember for the ad was supposed to be enough. </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t feel like there was much focus on the f2 but I&#8217;m OK with that in that the strongest aspect of s10 has been the diversity and depth of the talent. I thought the girls KILLED it on their Beyonce medley: Pia, Karen, and Naima were standouts and Ashthon and Thia were pretty good. Pia, Karen, Thia, and Naima had me thinking about what could&#8217;ve been had they made it further into the season. I loved Beyonce&#8217;s little moment of interacting with the girls too when she joined them. Haley had her moment during her Tony Bennett which was awesome as expected. LaurenA and Carrie were cute together.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Grammie Kari:</strong> My husband made the comment that it looked like Carrie was trying to outsing Lauren. I didn’t notice that, but with Lauren’s vocal problems or not, that would be easy to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>LOL no. That was Carrie holding back. You could see her encouraging LaurenA to take the front part of the stage at one point. Carrie closed the song with a flourish but up until that point she was definitely holding back. I thought their chemistry was nice to see.</p>
<p>The boys medley was a lot weaker and more uneven but it was still pretty entertaining. James had his moment with Judas Priest and I really think Scotty more than held his own with Tim McGraw. Jacob acquitted himself fine with Kirk Franklin and Gladys Knight. Casey &#038; Jack Black were entertaining. </p>
<p>The non-Idol related performances were fine too. They were spaced out enough IMO. </p>
<p>This is how to do a finale. What a great celebration of S10. Hope this season&#8217;s people rock it on tour and enjoy success after the show!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been fun ya&#8217;ll!</p>
<p>EDIT: Scotty is a class act as a winner. I loved him hugging each of the finalists, saying their names (well just Casey&#8217;s!), giving them what he probably thought was a moment on the camera. Loved what he said about LaurenA too. Good job Mr. and Mrs. McCreery.</p>

<p>I envision Scotty &amp; Lauren 20 yrs from now, married, kids, their youthful singing careers behind them, running a husband-and-wife singing ministry, maybe a show on PTL or cable.  Kinda like Kirk Cameron (formerly of Growing Pains).  Best of luck to them both!</p>

<p>In my area they ran a Ford commercial for Scotty right before the result.</p>
<p>I loved Beyonce (both times) and Gaga.  I thought Karen and Thia sounded real good.  Really, all the other girls had pop voices so Haley stood out more to me.  And, that was a lot of choreography to learn for one show.  Hats off to everyone!  Yes, Casey came off as a joke contestant, but he doesn&#8217;t seem to mind.  As long as you&#8217;re entertaining.</p>

<p>Did you not watch S4? Carrie had the most votes every single week. I guess the show didn&#8217;t exactly show this, but I know this season Randy said James could win it.</p>

1. Haley and Tony Bennett (tied with the Scotty crown/win)<br />
2. Beyonce Medley (Gold stars for Karen, Haley, Thia and Pia. In that order. How fierce was Thia with some of those moves?? She had some stage presence in SPADES. Wow. Didn&#8217;t see that coming.)<br />
3. Video packages: both, These top2 are young y&#8217;all (LOL) and &#8220;Who had the most shocking boot?&#8221; Yes loved the blowfish faces, Casey ripping on himself &#8211; Guess what we still think u suck. And Pia with the sash and crown. &#8220;What are you two discussing? Yeah, thats what I thought.&#8221;<br />
4. Gaga and Mark<br />
5. Marc Anthony, Sheila Freakinnn E!<br />
6. Seeing Lauren sing with Carrie. She must have had lead butterflies going on and she did well for being exhausted.</p>
<p>I flipping loved this season! And thats alot seeing as tho I didn&#8217;t wanna watch after Tim Halperin and Kendra didn&#8217;t make top13.</p>

<p>But Scotty&#8217;s signing of his single had to be the worst ever for a finale.  He certainly wasn&#8217;t bothering to sell it and what little he did sing was completely out of tune.</p>

<p>Highlights of the show to me:</p>
<p>Gaga<br />
Haley with Tony Bennet. Sublime and fantastic. Loved her dress too.<br />
Tom Jones-baby he&#8217;s still got it.<br />
James with Judas Priest.<br />
The comedy bits.<br />
The group numbers.</p>
<p>The lows: Casey with Jack Black. Jacob. Beyonce getting two numbers and former Idols being left out. Especially Lee. And Adam was in the house without even a camera shot of his gorgeous face.</p>

<p>Lol. I don&#8217;t have any problem with not really singing the coronation song well. It&#8217;s a terrible song, and I&#8217;m sorry that Scotty is stuck with it. I mean, Kris was able to ditch his song, so maybe Scotty is seeing if he can do the same.</p>

<p>The legacy acts still felt relevant, the artists of today (Beyonce, Gaga) have gravitas.  The comedy clips came from the idols rather than desperate actors hocking movies.  I laughed so hard at the Casey vs. James shocking boot-off. (I wonder if Pia kept her sash)</p>
<p>The girls sounded amazing on all of their numbers tonight &#8211; clearly the boys are the weaker link when it comes to harmonizing but they sure are amusing!</p>
<p>Scotty&#8217;s win was definitely not a surprise &#8211; I told my mom months ago he would win (of course Lauren was my pick in the pool, though, lol).  He was great tonight &#8211; when he is in the moment he is charismatic and viable rather than too silly to be taken seriously.  I did joke on twitter that he only hugged his loved ones in the audience in order to ensure that he wouldn&#8217;t have to sing the entirety of his wretched single.  (Although it wasn&#8217;t as bad tonight as it was yesterday).</p>
<p>Basically, tonight capped off why this was a good season despite some of its flaws.  Thanks for saving idol Season 10! <img src='http://3888.voxcdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>Most coronation singouts are pretty bad given the excitement of the moment. Honestly, I&#8217;m just relieved I didn&#8217;t have to endure it again tonight. That&#8217;s not a slight to Scotty, but the song itself. I&#8217;m convinced he was looking for a way out of it too and opted for the hugout. lol</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t for me either. I really believe he was leading this thing all along. So happy for him!</p>

<p>Maybe not.  It was highly unlikely that Lauren would win, but Nigel still wanted to set a record for number of votes, so they purposely tried to bus Scotty, knowing that it would galvanize his fans, just like similar tactics made many of David Cook&#8217;s fans vote more and longer than they normally would have.</p>

<p>And did anyone notice not only did Lauren take it well, she was hugging and kissing Scotty and as she went in to kiss him on the lips right after the annoucement, the camera panned. But my southern dad told me a long time ago that it is not shocking for platonic friends and family members to give a quick kiss on the lips to friends and loved ones who are not their spouse or gf.</p>

<p>He was following AI tradition. Seriously. EVERY coronation song is sung badly and out of key on Winners night. They are crying, out of breath, overwelmed, exhausted &#8211; viewers are certainly not expecting a true professional &amp; vocal technician in that moment. Kelly was rough on &#8220;Moment&#8221;, Fantie, Carrie, Taylor, Jordin, David (he was better than average), I can&#8217;t speak on Kris. And then, Lee. Possibly worst sing-out ever. But he was consistent. And I&#8217;ll stop there.</p>

<p>Me too! I loved the pageantbot snark too with Pia wearing a crown and sash. Casey and James killed it with their lines too. The Idols doing these skits worked SO much better than the usual comedic actor skits they&#8217;ve done (usually involving Jack Black and/or Ben Stiller).</p>

I absolutely do not think he&#8217;s a musical joke, btw.  What he is is someone who is on a cheesy reality show and knows how to laugh at himself. I think that&#8217;s kind of awesome.</p>
<p>I loved Haley and felt she was very respectful to Tony.  He totally kinda flubbed it in the beginning, but pulled through.  Very charming performance.</p>
<p>James and Judas Priest!  Rock on.  He had so much fun and so did I.</p>
<p>Oh, the Casey/James/Pia skit?  Too funny.</p>
<p>Tom Jones medley&#8230; fun!  I didn&#8217;t like Stefano&#8217;s version of KISS.  He tried to do it like Prince and no, he&#8217;s no Prince so it was jarring.</p>
<p>Carrie was very sweet to hold back and not totally wipe the floor with Lauren, who must be really suffering. I hope pushing through didn&#8217;t do any major damage to her vocal chords, because she has pipes and a promising career. </p>
<p>Scotty knows his song is ridiculous&#8230; I think he even laughed at one point when he sang the title lyrics.  Or he could have been overwhelmed with emotion.  Good luck to him.</p>
<p>I thought Lady Gaga was meh as far as the production goes. It may have been exciting live, but on TV it didn&#8217;t translate for me, for you.  Good choice in dancers, though.</p>
<p>Danny Gokey trending is kinda funny.  <img src='http://3888.voxcdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />   Enjoyed Steven, but the prize of the night (in terms of the established artists) goes to Beyonce on her second song.  </p>
<p>Oh, and Marc Antony?  He does look emaciated or something.</p>

Even though I know some wanted Casey to bring out his jazz chops&#8211;and I would have loved that too&#8211;his duet with Jack Black was fun and entertaining. I know Casey loves Jack Black&#8211;so its all good. I doubt that the performance will hurt his music career at all (as someone mentioned awhile back). Folks know he is a musician and all that.  It may even give a boost to him doing some acting in the future.</p>
<p>Loved seeing Haley with Tony Bennett. That was so nice. I also got a kick out of the shock boot video with James/Casey/Pia. That was cute.</p>
<p>Really enjoyed the Tom Jones medley&#8211;cheeky and good fun. </p>
<p>I did think there was a little too much Beyonce. I think she is a very good singer&#8211;but I rarely like the songs she does. The last one she sang&#8211;same chords over and over. Drives me crazy. </p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t surprised at Scotty winning-since most of us knew it all along.</p>

ITA&#8211;I think some of what Casey does in def done tongue in cheek. I think he is my fave idol of all time. Talented&#8211;but doesn&#8217;t take himself too seriously. I think that guy is meant for a career in show business</p>

The depth of the talent this year was really apparent tonight.  I don&#8217;t think Scotty is really all that but taken as a whole, this season and finale were entertaining.  So congrats, AI!</p>

<p>It sucks that Lee didn&#8217;t get to perform, it really was wrong of idol.  boo&#8230; </p>

                        <div id="dsq-comment-message-981195" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I enjoyed this finale so much more than I thought I would. I had to start it late and watch the recording, though I stopped it to watch Scotty win live, then went back to the recording. This also allowed me to skip over all the boring stuff. <img src='http://3888.voxcdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />   I agree that Beyonce and Steven Tyler killed it. I loved seeing Tony Bennett and especially Tony Jones. I *love* Casey so much, but I could not stomach watching him murder Fat Bottom Girls with Jack Black. I had to skip over that.  I also skipped over Lauren singing with Carrie and Scotty singing with Tim McGraw. I hate the song the girls sang, but I *really* really hate that song by Tim McGraw. In my musical world, that is clearly one of the worst songs every written. (And I actually kind of like Tim McGraw, but just can&#8217;t stand that song even for a second.)</p>
<p>I was surprised at the group numbers. I thought all the girls sounded good. I was especially surprised at Ashton. I wasn&#8217;t very impressed with her in the competition, but she sounded pretty good tonight. I loved Haley on If I Were a Boy. The only thing better would have been if she got to sing the entire song by herself. I loved Beyonce coming out to sing with the girls. </p>
<p>All in all, great fun, great finale. Scotty was adorable winning. I didn&#8217;t mind that he couldn&#8217;t pull it together to sing the horrible coronation song. It wasn&#8217;t a *moment* like David Cook&#8217;s win, but it was sweet and fun.  </p>
<p>Also, I was very glad Scotty won. I wasn&#8217;t happy with the final two, but I felt like Scotty deserved it way more than Lauren and I think Lauren will do just fine without the win.</p>
<p>What happened to Haley singing her new song on the finale?  Was that just a rumor?  I guess I&#8217;ll read the rest of the comments to find out.  <img src='http://3888.voxcdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />   I was hoping I could hear it and then buy it soon.</p>

I must be the only one who had a lot of fun with Jack Black and Casey. I absolutely do not think he’s a musical joke, btw. What he is is someone who is on a cheesy reality show and knows how to laugh at himself. I think that’s kind of awesome.</p></blockquote>
<p>I resemble these remarks.  Jack Black is massively charismatic and Casey threw down and didn&#8217;t seem intimidated at all.    Im just saying, I bet Casey totally knows the words to F*ck Her Gently, which makes two of us.  <img src='http://3888.voxcdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Also enjoyed James/Judas Priest (and lol at Durbin rocking the JP trademark Village People Biker Dude look), Haley/TB, Steven Tyler showing he still has pipes and Gaga taking a stage dive with the sublime Mark Kanemura.  Conversely, were we supposed to be impressed that J Lo can shake her ass?   Cuz I wasn&#8217;t feelin it <img src='http://3888.voxcdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  .</p>
<p>I would never in a million years buy a Scotty album, but I have no beef with his win.  You can&#8217;t help but be a little impressed with the maturity and poise he has for his age.</p>

Gaga was good; i like her song on the chorus<br />

Scotty win was so no surprise; congrats and good luck to him! Lauren has a great voice; if she grow more personal style, she can have a very nice career</p>

<p>1) Scotty won!  So adorable in the end as he sang his song and hugged all his family and friends.  It was the right cheesy coronation song after all.</p>
<p>2) Gaga: Cool!  But I thought they were going to blur her on stage fake sex antics</p>
<p>3)Beyonce!  Love her!  My girl crush.  </p>
<p>4)Jacob with Kirk Franklin and Gladys Knight!  Best idol + guess performance of the night</p>
<p>5) Haley with Tony Bennette. How cute was that???  i really liked it. </p>
<p>6)Casey with jack Black. Hilarious!  Casey should totally be in movies. </p>
<p>7)James with JP: Hated it.  I thought it was a mess. Maybe because I dislike metal and James had already performed the only JP song I sort of knew.<br />

I think that the forecasts for the final were slightly off-base.</p>
<p>All I have to say is that it is a wonderful feeling when a kid who seems to be really likable and enthusiastic, without pretense, who isn&#8217;t afraid to show affection to his parents, friends and fellow idolettes is crowned the winner.  Sometimes nice things happen to what appears to be a really nice person.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the topic of the thread, the show, I always love when the legends appear  on the finale in addition to current superstars.  As Tony Bennett is 85 and still sings beautifully and in all reality, many of these icons of this age or those in their 70s ..we need to appreciate them while they are here as we lose so many each year as they age.  That is what I liked the best, giving credit to the Pioneers in Music, the legends.</p>

<p>Wow, I totally didn&#8217;t pick up on that&#8230;How many years running has the previous AI winner filmed a spot where they give keys to the 2 finalists?? I can only recall David C. and Kris.</p>
<p>OMG, watching Jimmy Kimmel. He went on the streets and asked peeps to name winners of Idol based on their picture. The only one correctly named was Cook. WOW. They couldn&#8217;t identify Carrie (old pic, I&#8217;ll give em that), Kelly, Ruben, Lee, Kris, Taylor or Jordin. Jordin was called Liz. Taylor was &#8220;the old guy,&#8221; and Carrie got mistaken for Kellie Pickler. Heh.</p>

<p>I think her parents were just confused.  It makes sense that UMG would have found songs for Lauren, Scotty, James, Haley and maybe even Jacob, weeks ago, so that they would have time to work on the right production.  So, Haley would have performed her new song, if she had been in the final 2.</p>

<p>Like it or not, James placed higher than them so he get&#8217;s his moment on the finale.  I think it&#8217;s fair to do it that way.</p>

<p>Thought they were both good in that skit, too.   I can see Casey doing jazz in his spare time, but making it in comedy.  And somehow, I can see James on Broadway, replacing Constantine in Rock of Ages.  I think he must have been a theatre boi at one point.  He enjoys the choreography way too much in the group numbers.

<p>You think you&#8217;re bad?  People I&#8217;ve voted for in AI or AGT:  Clay, Crystal, Jackie Evancho, Lauren.  Had I watched more seasons of AI I probably would have an even more extensive list of 2nd place finishers to add, lol.</p>

Wow, I totally didn’t pick up on that…How many years running has the previous AI winner filmed a spot where they give keys to the 2 finalists?? I can only recall David C. and Kris.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cookie gave keys to Ford Fusions to Kris and Adam.  Kris did it last year for Crystal and Lee, I believe.  Maybe it wasn&#8217;t done this year since Scotty and Lauren are each getting their choice of model, so there would have been no specific model to give them keys for so they could then be seen sitting in the cars.  I don&#8217;t think Ford is springing for the potential extra dollars just to keep Lee out of the presentation.  The company has been doing quite well recently.</p>

(And who knows if they are&#8230;they may not be at all, if you remember Crystal and Lee last year and how there was nothing there at all in the end, but I&#8217;ve wondered a few times earlier in the season about their chemistry.  The kissing seemed to be a bit more than just friendship IMO.)  I mean, people do sometimes end up in serious relationships in high school &#8211; my brother is married to his &#8220;high school sweetheart,&#8221; he&#8217;s 27 and they&#8217;ve been together for something like 12 years.  Not saying it&#8217;s something that&#8217;d actually end up long term, but many folks that are in high school have a somewhat serious relationship at some point &#8211; so how is it not fitting for their age?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not one to usually say much like this or care&#8230;but I actually think it&#8217;s kinda cute, and good for them if they ARE together and are happy with each other.</p>

<p>Jacob finished in 5th place and James in 4th so of course they will get more air time , it happens every year. I think season 8 , they did have more trios and quartets of contestants who finished lower that they did not have this year..mostly group numbers for those who finish 7th or lower is the mode most years. So I was not shocked at all.</p>

<p>As it is possible Lauren does not have her license yet , no sure which ages for which states but in most, it is 16 before one can even get a learners permit and she has been busy with other things like Idol and her studies while on the show.</p>

<p>I would swear on a Bible from Scotty&#8217;s personal collection that he and Lauren aren&#8217;t dating at all.  That kiss was Final Two Fever &#8211; it happens every time.  First it was Kat and Taylor, then it was Crystal and Lee.  They just spend a lot of time together and become good friends.  And for the record, Lee made it very clear that he wasn&#8217;t keeping in touch with Crystal, and she married another guy within six months &#8211; that&#8217;s the way these things go.</p>

They have to forget about their songs, their idol responsibilities, rehearsals in order to do math, write papers, study history and science and so on. The tutor will give them tests and so on. It must be tough as I am sure their minds are everywhere else especially in the last couple of weeks but they have to be in school 3 hours per day no matter what else is going on. I am guessing perhaps studies finished up before Finals Week though as most schools are abou done if not done all ready.</p>

<p>True, he never had it even once.  Probably the only winner so far who didn&#8217;t.  But Idol likely didn&#8217;t give it to him because they knew how the votes were running and thought he didn&#8217;t need it.</p>

<p>Agreed.  People ship contestants every year. I think back in Season 4 it was Carrie and Anthoney.. Canthony!</p>
<p>It may go back even farther, but it happens every year.  Let&#8217;s see&#8230; this year we&#8217;ve had Casey and Haley; Pia and Stefano; and now Scotty and Lauren.  LOL.</p>

<p>Scotty and Lauren are two nice kids and I wish them well, even though neither is my cup of tea. I feel bad for them though because I&#8217;m sure after the innocent kisses they exchanged,the mouth breathers and basement dwellers of idol fandom are hard at work on squicky fan fic involving two MINORS.</p>

<p>Certainly the one with the best production values. Welcome back, Nigel, you evil twerp. You do know how to put on a good show.</p>
<p>All the fossils they found to sing with the kids seemed thrilled to be there and sang on key (remember Chicago last year? No? You&#8217;re lucky). </p>
<p>Everybody got their moment to shine (remember those years when everybody but a select few were just glorified back-up singers for like 30 seconds? Yep. It sucked).</p>
<p>The pointy pose dancing actually was dancing. Usually it&#8217;s just clump-clump, hit the mark, clump-clump. I&#8217;m not saying they are ready for SYTYCD, but there were some actual choreography going on there tonight.</p>
<p>Great lighting. Sound techs were not completely useless. They sobered up the camera guys from last night.  And the director hit his stride.</p>
<p>Lots of good use of humour. Some great songs. Some fantastic outfits.</p>
<p>Poor Lauren must have really burnt out her vocal chords since she skipped the two girl&#8217;s group numbers. I hope she&#8217;s okay and they didn&#8217;t push her too hard. </p>
<p>If I had a bone to pick, they shouldn&#8217;t have back-loaded all those stars who didn&#8217;t want to sing with the Idols. They should have been more sprinkled throughout the show like they were in S6. I know that they all wanted to the big ratings of the last half hour, but tell them they have to settle for 23M viewers instead of 23.5M or they can find another show to pimp their wears on.</p>
<p>I always feel a little sorry for the final two on the big results show because it&#8217;s obvious they&#8217;ve been worn thin by all the other stuff they have to get done to actually win the show. Typically, their voices are shot and they have had the least amount of time to practice the group numbers.</p>
<p>Yay! Scotty won! And man, during that sing-out, you could see just how much a kid he still is. Sometimes, he&#8217;s so composed and confident, I forget. Jimmy might not be happy that he didn&#8217;t do more to sing the song, but it was a nice moment. Sometimes you have to forget about making hay and just enjoy the flowers.</p>

<p>In 2006 &#038; 2008, James performed in a Santa Cruz children&#8217;s theater group called Kids on Broadway and played the lead role in Beauty and the Beast and Singin&#8217; in the Rain. Tony in West Side Story and Oscar in Sweet Charity. In 2008, James appeared in Alan Parsons&#8217; &#8220;Art &#038; Science of Sound Recording&#8221; educational video series, recording a version of Parsons&#8217; &#8220;We Play The Game&#8221; at Ex&#8217;pression College for Digital Arts.

I had tears in my eyes watching Scotty&#8217;s reaction when he won.  Everyone may have thought that Scotty had this wrapped up a long time ago, but they forgot to tell Scotty! His reaction was so great to see.  He truly is a humble, sweet young man who just was born with this amazing voice.  I loved seeing him finally have his chance to go hug his parents and family while he tried to get through his song.  </p>
<p>I think it said a lot that Scotty shared his special moment with the other contestants, telling James &#8211; I love you, man. James told him to go win it when he was voted off. Then he hugged Casey and sang his name and all the others, Stefano, Haley, Thia, Karen and Pia. I didn&#8217;t see him hug Jacob.  Lauren couldn&#8217;t stop kissing him.  </p>
<p>I thought Scotty cleared it all up earlier in the season when Ryan asked what was going on with Lauren.  He said, brother and sister.  So that is what I have to think it is between them &#8211; a close friendship and bond that they formed while they went through this journey together.</p>
<p>What a great show! Loved it!  I am so happy for Scotty!  This is the kid that got me to listen to country music!  The people who know me will never get over it! <img src='http://3888.voxcdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>Cause kissing for teens is all squicky and everything, lol.  Seriously, it&#8217;s not like people are saying they are doing the nasty! (TM Jacob Lusk)</p>

Jimmy might not be happy that he didn’t do more to sing the song, but it was a nice moment. Sometimes you have to forget about making hay and just enjoy the flowers.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s been a pleasure rooting for the same horse, a pleasure, lol!  I enjoyed the sing out because he let the veil slip a bit and was just a kid, and it was heartwarming.  I adore this kid and want only the best for him, whatever that may be.  I&#8217;ve enjoyed watching this season and his journey!</p>

<p>Scotty &amp; Lauren were adorable together, and it was nice seeing Scotty break down and act his age. We&#8217;re so used to seeing him so cool &amp; collected all the time.  And all Lauren&#8217;s kisses.  So sweet.  </p>
<p>I was smiling all night, and still am. Very happy with the results, and so looking forward to seeing what happens with these two.</p>

<p>There was no time wasted on silliness like Kara in a bikini or Pants on the Ground, instead there was a pretty entertaining shocking book bit.</p>
<p>There of my favorite performances were the first three men James + Judas Priest, Jacob + Kirk Franklin and Gladys Knight, and Casey + Jack Black. Since James, Jacob and Casey were not on my fav list, this was a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Liked lots of other parts of the show.</p>
<p>My only problems were that 5 numbers without any Idols which seemed a bit much to me &#8212; although I guess are expect to drive ratings. And no time for Lee. Couldn&#8217;t they have had him give the Ford keys to Lauren and Scotty after they gave the Teachers their keys. It would have only required cutting 15 secs of J.Lo. &#8220;dance&#8221;.</p>

<p>Okay, I am post whoring now, but this is exactly how I feel.  I am so glad for him.  I must admit I started voting for him because even though I acknowledge that he is low key.  His singing touched something in me, and even though I didn&#8217;t expect it, I just went with it, and voila, he&#8217;s season 10&#8242;s American Idol.   Amazeballs!</p>
<p>ETA:  Kudos to Lauren Alaina, who acquitted herself with panache tonight.  She was so happy for him, and that was such a joy to behold.  Say what you will about these two, but their parents raised some great kids.</p>

<p><strong>Best Outfit of the Night:</strong> Haley&#8217;s duet dress. That thing is gorgeous and she looked absolutely freakin&#8217; amazing. </p>
<p><strong><br />
Guest who Most Looked Like an Escapee From Fargo</strong>: Mark Anthony. Is it me, or could he play Steve Buscemi&#8217;s brother? I hope Nigel hid all the woodchippers.</p>
<p><strong>Best Outcome from a Failed Single</strong>: Lady Gaga. Lately, Gaga has not known that less is sometimes more. Everything is stupidly driven to extremes. She was supposed to sing Judas on this show, but that song flopped harder than a 6-week old dead fish. One massive, over-the-top production number in the dustbin. So, they quickly cobbled together a paper mache cliff and told her just to stand on the top because there was no time to learn new choreography. Finally, she just sang. And then cooly fell off the cliff (just like her song Judas did). Woo!</p>
<p><strong>Best Sport:</strong> James. Seriously, he sang the pussycat song and made fun of his shock boot. I like him.</p>
<p><strong>Best Reason to Listen to Your Vocal Coach:</strong> Judas Priest. Did the lead singer always sound like a bunch of gravel in a washing machine because that is one seriously shot voice. </p>
<p><strong>Most Enthusiastic Guest</strong>: Kirk Franklin. That guy was everywhere and having the time of his life. Tough not to smile</p>
<p><strong>Most in Awe of His Guest Duet Partner:</strong> Scotty. You could just tell how he couldn&#8217;t believe he was getting to sing with Tim McGraw. You could practically see himself pinching himself. </p>
<p><strong>Person Most Earnest About the Dance Sessions:</strong> Stefano. He was determined to work it.</p>
<p><strong>Person who Missed Most of the Dance Sessions: </strong> Scotty. He was totally checking out what the other guys were doing. That&#8217;s the trouble with going to school and having to compete in the finale.</p>
<p><strong>Person who Most Dances to their own Drum:</strong> Paul, James and Casey. Motto: Just have fun and people will enjoy it. And I did.</p>
<p><strong> Best Duet:</strong> I loved them all. Everybody was having a blast. I sound just like Steven. Do you think Nigel will pay me millions of dollars to be a judge next year? </p>
<p><strong>Best Jacket:</strong> Spider man dude&#8217;s. Totally a throwback to the 80s and I&#8217;d feel like an idiot wearing it, but strangely, I covet it.</p>
<p>What a fun night. What a fun crew.</p>

The actual result was very anticlimatic, but the performances ranged from solid to amazing. It was so much fun just to be there. My favorite moments were the Top 13 girls singing with Beyonce, seeing the 2 remaining members of TLC perform, and the Casey/Jack Black duet. But there really wasn&#8217;t a bad performance in the bunch. The only thing I was upset about was the fact they didn&#8217;t even let Lee do the ceremonial &#8220;hand the car keys to the Top 2&#8243; moment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kris &#038; Katy were sitting right behind Adam &#038; Sauli. Some of my friends had a good view of them from their seats, and they said that Kris &#038; Adam were talking to each other during every commercial break, and that they were swarmed by other idols nd random people.</p>

<p>Kicked it&#8217;s butt, threw it out the door and turned out the light. </p>
<p>Woo. </p>
<p>Anyway, I do have a question. Were any of the production numbers shot before the show? That string of non-Idol performances seemed to feature some serious set-pieces and I&#8217;m not sure they could have put them all up and broken them down during the commercial breaks (granted, the commercial breaks were long enough). And at some point they would have had to have extracted Spiderman from the rafters.</p>
<p>What a fun night. The girls were amazeballs in their group number with Beyonce (is there nothing Haley can&#8217;t sing?), the guys group number was SO much fun. I can&#8217;t think of a bad duet.</p>

<p> OMG my favorite moment of the night was Haley-Tony. OMG she is just amazing. We have another Haley moment to add to her many moments. I honestly cannot get enough of this girl and I would buy anything from her. Did anyone notice how much better Haley is over Pia as well? Does anyone see a future for Haley Reinhart? I just love her to death. Again she delivers. She only has given us some of the biggest moments of season 10. What contestant gave you the biggest moments?</p>

<p>Scotty was just being rushed through and it was getting crowded as the judges got there just as he was about to hug Jacob. I am sure it happened later. As I think they all get along as remember Jacob was the first one to hug Casey when he got saved that night and recovered from the shock..backstage and Jacob was always there hugging everyone along with the rest, I think they all get along well.</p>

<p>Too much Jacob?  He had his spotlight performance with Gladys Knight and Kirk Franklin and his solo in the Tom Jones medley.  Did I miss anything else?  He came in 5th.  I know the producers hated him, but they had to give him his spotlight performance.  And I still think Scott dissed him at the end.  He didn&#8217;t hug him when he was hugging everybody else.</p>

<p>But I found the finale to be a snooze. I hung in for the first hour, but all of the music numbers (and of course, all the cheezie bits) just felt incredibly tedious, so I turned it off. Even Haley and Casey&#8217;s numbers were disappointing. But, it&#8217;s been an exhausting work week, so maybe it just wasn&#8217;t a good night to be watching tv.</p>
<p>I hops idol does a good job of thinking about what new things worked and what didn&#8217;t. I really hope they return to judging the voting rounds.</p>

If someone is going to have a career in the music business,  it is not an easy road and filled with tough critiques. The judges do them no favors taking it too easy on them. I think Randy did get tough on a couple of them but overall, it was only 2 or 3 all season and he was inconsistent. When Simon was there, Randy was tougher and said a lot of ..Dawg that was not good or just aiight.He did not even say..Just Aiight to any performance of some of them all season.<br />
It is like Randy mirrors the attitude of the other guy on the panel, Steven praises them all so Randy is more mild than ever before when he was with Simon. It was like Simon made it ok for Randy to get tougher orsomething ? </p>
<p>I hope Nigel tells the judges to speak their minds and not be so easy on the contestants.</p>

He will be known as the only original judge and I am sure he makes a boatload of money and gets offered huge raises to stay just because he like Ryan have been there for all 10 years.<br />
I wish he would leave and Simon would offer him a job but it would be judging with he and Paula and we would have original idol panel on XFactor. Who knows, Simon and Randy are very close friends so maybe someday it will happen. </p>
<p>I have doubts that Steven will stay for more than 2-3 years if that. As he may want to get back on the road touring and it would interfere with auditions and Idol&#8230;as with auditions later in the summer and fall and Hollywood week and such..he almost has to do a tour on off months ..or right after Idol and schedule it all around auditions.  </p>
<p>Jennifer Lopez is probably loving this as her videos and songs can be seen by a wide audience and Mark also is getting a lot of PR. I am not a JLO fan but I think she is there to stay as the show acts like it was a huge , huge thing to get her and if paid well enough, she will stay. Paula left because Simon and Randy were getting considerably better raises and Ryan too,</p>
<p>So I see this same bunch for a couple of years until contract negotiations break down or Simon tries to nab one or two of them for X Factor or another show and pays them better.<br />
Plus she can be home with her kids more often instead of out on the road touring and performing all over the world.</p>

He was a strange choice for that group.</p>
<p>Haley really deserves the props tonight, too. The girl can really sing anything. No wonder she never let them put her in a box by making her pick a genre and stick with it. I&#8217;ll definitely check out any music she releases.</p>
<p>I do wish that Lee had been given an acknowledgement. It&#8217;s really no fun as a fan to see one of your favorites tossed aside like that. He deserved better.</p>

I think Finale is reserved now for big name acts or acts that can perform duets with the top 6 or group numbers or hugely successful current artists perforning alone ala Bono and GaGa.</p>

<p>Question is, who is my favorite winner, Scotty or Kris? I think just because he&#8217;s more recent, Scotty has the slight edge. </p>
<p>1. Scotty McCreery<br />
2. Kris Allen<br />
3. Kelly Clarkson<br />
4. David Cook<br />
5. Carrie Underwood<br />
6. Jordin Sparks<br />
7. Ruben Studdard<br />
8. Fantasia Barrino<br />
9. Taylor Hicks<br />
10. Lee DeWyze</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how I&#8217;d rank the winners in my personal opinion. I don&#8217;t HATE Lee, though, he&#8217;s just the weakest winner (and I feel terrible for him being snubbed horribly&#8230; At least he had a second to talk on my local news!) </p>
<p>I found Adam and&#8230;. Sauli? in the picture, but I could barely see Kris and Katy. </p>
<p>Jason Castro, Stefano Langone, James Durbin, Kris Allen, David Cook, and a few others who were at the red carpet event shouted out to Sacramento on my local news! Woo hoo!

<p>True as there were a couple of times tonight when Ryan had to wait for the next act to set up and he could have walked back to Lee and asked the audience to acknowledge last year&#8217;s Idol.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really a shame not to have the most recent winner perform.  I suppose Lee doesn&#8217;t have anything to plug, but I&#8217;m sure he hasn&#8217;t forgotten all his songs.</p>
<p>I was trying to think what I wouldn&#8217;t mind losing in order to accommodate a Lee performance.  I enjoyed the spectacle of the Spiderman song, but it had nothing at all to do with AI.  So, that&#8217;s the one I would have cut.  </p>
<p>But I guess that current Idol has no reason to plug past Idol winners, since none of them are signed to UMG.</p>

I do think Pia needs to break out of her &#8220;stage shell&#8221; (judging by interviews and what not, she is very likeable &#8211; but she just hasn&#8217;t been able to bust it out on the stage).

Honestly Randy is locked in for next year, so is Steven Tyler but the big question will Jennifer Lopez renew her contract? She said shes going to be on tour with her new album. I bet she doesn&#8217;t return for season 11 but the thing is she is replacable IMO. It just finding the right person.</p>

It had such great talent this season. Actually the finale made up for last nights dreck of a final show. Honestly the thing is we need more judging next year. Honestly Randy is locked in for next year, so is Steven Tyler but the big question will Jennifer Lopez renew her contract? She said shes going to be on tour with her new album. I bet she doesn’t return for season 11 but the thing is she is replacable IMO. It just finding the right person.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think IF JLo leaves, they should bring Shania Twain on board. I really liked her as a guest judge in Season 9 and as a mentor. She could be someone else who uses idol to revive her career! <img src='http://3888.voxcdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

Much more relaxed and enjoyable. I can see how people who normally don&#8217;t watch the show could tune in and have a nice time.</p>
<p>Favourite funnies: Jack Black and Casey singing Fat Bottomed Girls; Jack Black joining the row of Scotty&#8217;s family for a hug at the end and not getting one.</p>
<p>Least entertaining: Spiderman (though Spidey had an incredible voice and was very cute.) And the Tom Jones medley until the man himself showed up and reminded everybody how well those songs can be sung.</p>
<p>Nice to see Lee placed for maximum visibility throughout the evening and I hope he was seated there for that purpose. Wish they had kept him in the line-up but no David Cook performance either (and he has a new single.)</p>
<p>MAJOR EPIPHANY: during Hayley&#8217;s performance with Tony Bennet it hit me: she sounds like Billie Holliday!</p>
<p>I pulled out my BH vinyl and played &#8220;No Regrets&#8221; &#8211; holy cow! I am definitely going to see her if she comes to town and am downloading some of her songs on iTunes this morning. I have NEVER downloaded a contestant&#8217;s Idol songs before. She has a solid career IMHO; may not be filling stadiums or topping charts but she is going places.</p>

Scotty seems like a really nice guy, and although I&#8217;m not a fan of his singing, I hope that he does well.  He&#8217;s carried himself really well throughout the competition.  Lauren has a lot of potential and held up well last night too.  I think that her duet with Carrie would have been a real show stopping moment, if she were in full voice.  Nice that Scotty and Lauren appear to be friends.</p>

I like that there were more current &amp; relevant guests, mostly visual performers. Hands down to the castoffs. They stole the show, for me. Beyonce w/ the girls were amazing &#8211; Pia, Karen, &amp; Thia especially. The pageant girl who was consistently on pitch &amp; danced on rhythm in EVERY group poses during the idol run was noticed &amp; given more face time&#8230;finally. The &#8220;shocking elimination&#8221; skit was a hoot. I rewatched it aaa many times &amp; Pia&#8217;s appearance at the end still cracks me up everytime.</p>

<p>I watched bits and pieces of the finale.  (thankyou for the vids mj!) and while I didnt watch the idols performing ( I dont care ), I loved Beyonce&#8217;s medley with the girls, and her ballad, and even Gaga&#8217;s performance.  I used to love her, but now my love has dumbed down to like, and i have to say Beyonce wiped the floor with her to be honest.  That woman is flawless.  I also loved Marc Antony&#8217;s performance.  I know he only got the spot because of his wife, but damn, he is one GREAT salsa performer, and salsa is awesome!</p>

<p>Congrats to Scotty for winning. He won this thing since day 1. I do believe he won this mostly with his chrisma and likability than his actual talent. Really curious how he&#8217;ll do. If Danny Gokey can have a decent carrer in country, then Scotty gotta be the most successful country star since Carrie.</p>
<p>Also wanted to add an interview with Casey and Haley last night that really showed their chemistry.<br />

1. Kelly Clarkson<br />
2. Jordin Sparks<br />
3. Carrie Underwood<br />
4. Scotty McCreery<br />
5. David Cook<br />
6. Fantasia<br />
7. Ruben Studdard<br />
8. Taylor Hicks<br />
9. Kris Allen<br />
10. Lee DeWyze</p>
<p>Kelly is my favorite winner. I also love Jordin and Carrie. Both are great singers, but I like pop/rnb music more than country, so Jordin beats Carrie. Scotty is in 4th place for me, at least for now. Country is not my favorite genre, but when Scotty is good, he&#8217;s very very good. If Lauren won, I would also put her right behind Carrie for now, but I like Lauren more than Scotty, so she would be a bit closer to Carrie. </p>
<p>David Cook, Fantasia and Ruben Studdard are in the middle for me. I think they are all decent singers and recording artists and all put out some good material, but they don&#8217;t appeal to me as much as the first 4. </p>
<p>Taylor Hicks can be decent as a singer/performer, but his material does nothing for me.<br />
Kris Allen and Lee DeWyze just do it for me as singers.</p>
<p>My favorite contestants over the years:<br />
Season 1: Kelly Clarkson (winner), followed by Tamyra Gray (4th)<br />
Season 2: Clay Aiken (2nd place) &#8211; based on live performances on the show from the videos I&#8217;ve seen<br />
Season 3: Jennifer Hudson (7th place)<br />
Season 4: Carrie Underwood (winner)<br />
Season 5: Chris Daughtry (4th place), I also like Kellie Pickler (6th)<br />
Season 6: Jordin Sparks (winner)<br />
Season 7: David Archuleta (2nd place)<br />
Season 8: Adam Lambert (2nd place), also loved Allison Iraheta (4th)<br />
Season 9: Umm, I guess Michael Lynche (4th), because he gave several good performances in a pretty bad season.<br />
Season 10: Haley Reinhart (3rd place), followed by Lauren Alaina (2nd) and Scotty McCreery (winner)</p>

<blockquote><p>Toscano isn’t the only finalist Jerkins has been working with. With a directive from Interscope Geffen A&#038;M chairman Jimmy Iovine, he’s been tasked with composing songs for runner-up Lauren Alaina and winner Scotty McCreery. “This was training for us producers,” Jerkins tells THR. “I wrote five country songs last week. It’s transformed not just the contestants but even the producer. Tricky [Stewart] produced that &#8216;Mama&#8217; song for Lauren, and he said, ‘With this show, we’re not just urban pop guys anymore.’ George Strait can call me tomorrow and I’m ready to go!”</p></blockquote>

Halford took Durbin to school and showed him what a metal singer should sound like. It highlighted the shrillness of Durbin&#8217;s voice.   Carrie took Lauren to school too. That duet showed the weakness in Lauren&#8217;s voice too. But with Lauren it&#8217;s probably lack of confidence. The duet between Casey and Jack Black was fun. Who knew Casey was such a fun type of guy. JLo&#8217;s dancing was cringe inducing. When I look at JLo I keep seeing my mom. She&#8217;s pretty but still &#8211; ewwwww.  I couldn&#8217;t figure out how GaGa managed to still sing loud and strong without missing a beat when she put the microphone done while she was doing that awkward dance with the guy.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful interview.  Haley is so awesome in every way and Casey is such a joyful human being.  I don&#8217;t know why they are making such a huge point out of denying any romance.  They are so obviously perfect for each other.  Hey, if Casey does manage to land Haley, he is the real winner of Season 10 (great comment posted on the video by somebody).  Both have Chicago roots, so it could actually work.  Does anybody really believe that nothing happened?  I call BS.  They at least made out.</p>
<p>All pure speculation, of course, but I adore both of them and in my dreams they are making extraordinarily talented musical babies together.</p>

Saw ILYTB at #2 on iTunes and LMMD at #4.  Both of their voices are amazing recorded.  Even though not very crazy about Scotty&#8217;s debut song, was great for him to sing while hugging his family and the other Idols.  Carrie&#8217;s song &#8220;Inside Your Heaven&#8221; was dumb, too, but it made some bucks&#8211;was quickly forgotten when &#8220;Jesus, Take the Wheel&#8221; came out.  So I am hoping for a song the calibre of JTTW for Scotty.  I think Lauren&#8217;s song fits her to a T.</p>

<p>Because they didn&#8217;t sing enough duets over the course of the season?  Would have been overkill.  When Taylor and Kat sang &#8220;Time of My Life,&#8221; it was new because they had never done anything together, so it was interesting.  Scotty and Lauren had already sung together multiple times, competitively and non-competitively.  Really no reason to do it again.</p>

<p>How can it mean nothing? They are charting now because they are selling now. The iTunes rank shows how many singles have sold within the last so many days (it&#8217;s a rolling window). They don&#8217;t batch up all the sales and report them when they suddenly stop suppressing them from charting.</p>

It’s transformed not just the contestants but even the producer.

<p>I&#8217;m going to say the theory that no one cares about the contestants this year and only is entertained by the show is off to a rough start with the tour selling better and each of the two finalists having a song in the top ten on Itunes this year.

<p>UMG Nashville is definitely putting country writers to work for them. For instance Dallas Davidson is lined up to work with Scotty. He had hand in writing the most country #1s in 2010, he&#8217;s a cowriter on Lady A&#8217;s Just A Kiss (not the best recommendation!), and he cowrote with CaseyJ earlier this year. I expect the rest of the Peach Pickers are involved too.</p>
<p>Rodney Jerkins cowriting a song for Scotty may not be the worst thing in that I think a good country soul song could work for Scotty BUT it needs to be somebody country writing the lyrics. If not then forget it (but Scotty will probably be stuck with it anyway). </p>
<p>Scotty and LaurenA will be setting a record for the highest debut week (digital) sales for a debut single by a male and female country act respectively. If Scotty&#8217;s song were better then I&#8217;d say he had a chance at breaking the debut week record for a single for all male country acts (138k &#8211; Blake Shelton&#8217;s Honeybee). </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll be getting carpetbagger accusations. For all their other flaws, it&#8217;s clear Scotty and LaurenA are rooted in country. They do have other issues to overcome in the country world though.</p>

He reminded everyone what it means to be a rockstar.<br />
Beyonce was magnificent, I never bought one cd of hers but I&#8217;ll be the first to buy a concert ticket.<br />
I think it&#8217;s a huge coup to get Bono and The Edge on the show and the Spiderman thing was ok.<br />
Lady Gaga was upstaged even tough I was really happy that Mark K got such a great gig</p>

In looking back, I see a lot of positive and negative about this year.  I think that the judges did a great job of selecting a very diverse and talented top 13, but then they dropped the ball with consistency during the meat of the season.</p>
<p>Watching last night&#8217;s show gave me the following random thoughts:</p>
<p>- I loved the personalities and talent in the top 13.  I did think that the top 2 were boring.</p>
<p>- voting needs to be addressed to reflect more favorably on the viewing audience.</p>
<p>- I missed Paul&#8217;s drunken uncle dance (and his tweets)</p>
<p>- Thia did herself a disservice by trying out this year.  She should have waited two years and then won the whole thing.</p>
<p>- Karen was a much better singer than 12th place.</p>
<p>- I missed Naima&#8217;s energy.  I hope she does well.</p>
<p>- Haley&#8217;s growth and story was epic and I wish she won.</p>
<p>- James and Casey were eliminated at about the right spot for each.</p>
<p>- Pia was her own worst enemy. She lost by playing the game safe like if she was in season 3.</p>
<p>- Scotty is a real nice kid and deserves only good things.</p>
<p>- Lauren should have been eliminated around top 4</p>
<p>- Randy needs to go away&#8230; far away.</p>

I did enjoy last night&#8217;s finale! So many good performances, but my fav was the guy&#8217;s group number with Tom Jones. The guys just seemed so happy and in sync. Everything about that number was Win for me. I also thought Scotty showed why he was a top contender all season. He really held his own with Tim McGraw (who is still a fantastically handsome man). The other thing I will take away was the geniune support and care on display between Scotty and Lauren. They may be only friends, but they are SO darn cute together!!!!!!  Overall, a great night!</p>

<p><strong>Kirsten,</strong> it looks like girlygirl hasn&#8217;t answered this yet.<br />
I was at the Finale also and every performance was live. They setup all the production during commercials. The commercials to me, seemed many and long!  One of the Spiderman guys came down from a platform above my head, between Orch. and Balcony. He was there for a bit before the Bono number actually started. The only close call, the whole night (as far as setting up goes,) was the spider web that was the background while they were singing. It wasn&#8217;t going back up to the ceiling, like it was supposed to. It had dropped down from the ceiling for set up. It even warranted Nigel going up on stage to see what was wrong. They finally got it off with maybe 2 seconds to spare. We were all wondering WTF they were going to do if they couldn&#8217;t get that thing off the stage.<br />
It was a great finale. And as great as it sounded on TV, I have come to the conclusion that nothing should ever be televised from The Nokia. The sound and the voices live were 10X better than the broadcast!</p>

Reminded me it&#8217;s a new kind of Idol where all season, someone whose talents are limited to one genre hardly ever has to go outside his wheelhouse, and then wins.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of Scotty but not sorry he won and congrats to him &#8211; nice kid. I didn&#8217;t especially enjoy the season, and can&#8217;t say if I&#8217;ll be watching next year or not. I really prefer more musically mature contestants, overall. Cook, Castro, Archie, Adam, Casey James, Lee, Crystal, and especially my favorite, Kris, to name just a few who I&#8217;ve either loved, liked or admired the past few years. I felt their musicality and tastes in music were wide ranging and interesting and they were almost standing up for something they believed in, when it came to music. This year was much more showbiz; I didn&#8217;t especially like the limiting of instruments (though Season 9 was not great, I don&#8217;t know if that was the reason), and I didn&#8217;t feel there was a lot of musical maturity to a lot of the performers. I didn&#8217;t dislike any of them but I was bored as a music fan.</p>
<p>Just my opinion, not trying to rain on the parade! Thanks, MJ, once more for the great coverage and for letting us express our opinions here!</p>

<p>And (not counting season 9, because I&#8217;m pretending it never happened) I finally had my favorite win again! First time since Taylor Hicks!</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t think you were! He enunciated each placement very carefully so we would be *sure* to notice. (That was probably written into all the guests&#8217; contracts&#8230;.) I was waiting to hear him announce that somebody had a new line of souffle mixes or hair-care products coming out, honestly.</p>

<p>Exactly!  I did not watch the final because I knew it would be bad and from all accounts it was but the finale!!!! wonderful awesomeness, even though another boring guy won, that we probably wont hear much about again, in a year or two, other than that, last night was great!  I do wish Scotty well, he seems like the nicest kid</p>

I do feel bad for him but David Cook was rumoured as well and he didn’t get a spot either, so he’s in very good company.</p></blockquote>
<p>The press kept getting &#8220;performing on the finale&#8221; mixed up with performing on final two night, for which David was scheduled and performed. Of course, it didn&#8217;t help that Idol, itself, was calling the two nights, &#8220;The Finale.&#8221; </p>
<p>I guess, Finale part 1 and Finale part 2. </p>
<p>So, no. There was no credible reports that David was scheduled to perform on Part 2 of the Finale, other than the rumors that were floating around earlier that all the winning idols would perform in celebration of the 10 Year Anniversary which clearly didn&#8217;t happen and might have been an earlier plan which was dropped. Who knows.</p>
<p>ETA: Also it&#8217;s hard to feel sorry for a guy who not only closed the Top Two performance night but was used in the opening of the show, with Carrie, as a former Idol winner who went from singing as a child to winning the show and becoming a successful recording artist.</p>

Too much emphasis on celebrities and not enough on the contestants. Although I do love Lady Gaga and enjoyed her performance. Also, why did the girls get a current, relevant performer like Beyonce to sing with while the guys had to do a Tom Jones medley? At least the guys had fun with it. I&#8217;m a James girl, so I thought he and Priest totally killed it, although I was sad that his dream of singing with Steven wasn&#8217;t realized. When Steven started singing, my heart started pounding, hoping for James to appear. Alas, did not happen. Scotty and Lauren are good kids, still, it should have been James and Pia in the finale, with James winning.</p>

3.Liked the rest of them,except this year.Just not a fan, but he seems like a nice kid-good luck to him.</p>
<p>Nigel is totally lacking in class, unlike Lee.He&#8217;s been getting lots of upset tweets from fans and some flack in the press from people like Lindsey Parker for his treatment of Lee in leaving him off.the Finale.<br />
Lee just spent two weeks in Asia and in every one of his many interviews he praised the show, Season 10, and the talent of the contestants.<br />
Nigel repays him by trying to flip the situation and making Lee look like a diva.Lee DeWyze is one of the nicet people on the planet. Nigel-not so much.</p>

<p>If they bring back this group of judges, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll watch next year. Boring boring boring. And not helpful to the contestants, either, in my opinion&#8230;.. I like contest shows because you can see people get motivated to improve and grow and struggle. I saw next to nothing of that this year.<br />
But I did hear a lot of crap about JLo and Steven&#8217;s new videos and books and winning beauty and the like. If they want that, they should buy infomercial time, in my opinion. They can afford it.</p>

Overall the performances were really solid, a testament to the high level of talent this year.  If Haley wasn&#8217;t going to win it then I&#8217;m satisfied with Scotty taking the title.  Hard to believe he&#8217;s just 17.  Way more ready for primetime than Lauren.  </p>
<p>The cut away shots of Jack Black in the audience were hysterical.  He was certainly having fun.  lol.</p>
<p>I thought Karen, Thia and Pia sounded fantastic in their solo bits.  And I really liked the comedy bits, especially the ones with Casey, James and Stefano.  Very funny stuff.</p>
<p>Wow.  Marc Anthony&#8217;s glazed, sweaty look was seriously distracting.  He looked as if he&#8217;d been starved and held hostage in a dungeon for 5 months and then they put him in a car and drove him straight to the stage!  ha.  I honestly thought he was going to fall down at some point.  And then there&#8217;s JLo standing next to him, positively glowing.  What an odd couple. </p>
<p>That jazzy number Haley sang with Tony B. was right in her wheelhouse.  She sounded like a seasoned pro.  I hope she gets to make a record.</p>
<p>ETA:  Add my voice to the chorus who thinks Lee was treated poorly.</p>

<p>I will say that this was a really, <em>really</em> good finale.  So much better than I expected and the girls rocked the show last night, for me.</p>
<p>I still think the S5 finale was the best ever and even last night did not change that opinion, though it was a terrific evening of entertainment.</p>
<p>Loved the humor bits, too.  Done just right.</p>
<p>I have long since accepted that Idol will showcase the winners (and non-winners) it considers successes and ignore the rest.  It is what it is &#8212; Taylor, Kris, Lee.  See you guys with the other valet parking attendants.</p>
<p>It is also interesting reading everyone&#8217;s favorite Idol winners, so I will have a go as well:</p>
<p>1. Taylor<br />
2. Kelly<br />
3. Ruben<br />
All the rest can be 4-9 in any order.  No favorite. No one I much care about musically.  #10 Fantasia will always be last on any of my lists.<br />
My list of favorite Idols consists of a lot of Idol also-rans (Bo, Clay, Brooke, Archie, Adam + others).  I do thank the crazy machine that is American Idol for introducing me to them, and to the world.</p>

                        <div id="dsq-comment-message-981547" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>MJ, perhaps there should be some discussion on &#8216;lessons learned&#8217; on this blog.  It would be interesting to hear what everyone thinks (I’m sure that there are some common themes).  Here are my thoughts (now only if Nigel were reading this…):</p>
<p>-	The selection process, Hollywood week, and top 24 pick were about right on target this year. I would try to keep to that formula and look for another talented and diverse crop.</p>
<p>-	The top 24 to top 13 bloodbath was a little severe.  I don’t think that the final 13 was necessarily the best 13 from that group.  I would look at top 6 from each group and 2 wild cards to make a top 14.</p>
<p>-	Voting needs to change.  Power voting is just too prevalent. When you can download an app for your phone that sends out 100 votes per hour, or you can multiply your votes by setting up groups with the same number, things are bad and the vote total doesn’t equal the demographic of the viewing audience. Even ‘dial idol’ automates the voting process (albeit with outdated technology). The bottom line is that voting needs to be more reflective of the viewing public, still allow for fans to vote multiple times, and still make money for their sponsors. My idea is to have diminishing returns on votes over a certain limit (i.e., over 50 votes then votes count 1/2 or 1/10).</p>
<p>-	The judges need to provide help to the contestants. JLo was very constructive at some points, but totally not at others.  Steven was fun, but irrelevant.  What ONE change, would be best?  Replace Randy with Jimmy Iovine.  Randy is more than useless.  He’s inconsistent.  The fact of the matter is that all three judges dropped the ball during the elimination rounds and that hurt the show.</p>
<p>-	Have fresher themes.  Themes are great in that it forces creativity on the contestants.  However, we can’t just have these same moldy old themes year after year.  Ideas for theme nights would be: acapella night, songs without rhythm (no strings or drums allowed in the arrangement), Bluegrass night, songs your parents made out to, … the list goes on.. just make it fresh and not a retread … except for Beatles week.. you can never go wrong with the Beatles <img src='http://3888.voxcdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

Not the best season ever, but it was still one of my favorites. If i had to rank the season to past seasons, best to worst, i think i&#8217;ll go with:<br />
1. Season 8<br />
2. Season 7<br />
3. Season 5<br />
4. Season 10<br />
5. Season 4<br />
6. Season 2<br />
7. Season 1<br />
8. Season 6<br />
9. Season 3<br />
10. Season 9</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m more partial to Season 10 because of Haley. If she wasn&#8217;t on the show I would of tuned out when Casey was eliminated because he was entertaining to watch. It&#8217;s no surprise that Haley was the only one to grow on the show with being the only one getting real critiques. As much it was so frustrating to watch her being the only getting picked on, it did help her along the way and it did make her comeback all the more satisfying. Next year the judges NEED to up their game. Unfortunately, this marks the first year where my favorite didn&#8217;t make it into Top 2. Hope next year America actually gets it right from the beginning, but not getting my hopes up.</p>

<p>I think they will improve next year. Kara was pretty bad her first year, but the year after she was very constructive and gave some good advice. Yes, she was condescending at times, but she knew what she was talking about. I think the judges have work cut out for them next year.</p>

<p>If I have to name one change it has to be limiting the votes.<br />
When a show watched by around 20 million people, most of whom will not pick up the phone and vote for anyone, gets 120 million votes, you know something is wrong.  Limit it to 10 votes per method.<br />
A distant second would be more sharp-but-real criticism from the judges.  But I even think that fixing the voting would improve the judging.</p>

<p>I hope you&#8217;re right. But I kind of think that ST and JL are just too much big-time performers with way too much vested interest in being liked to ever function as actual judges. If the studio audience starts booing them &#8212; and they will, if they say the least little critical thing, no matter how helpful and kindly intended &#8212; I have a hard time seeing either of them continuing to criticize. Performers don&#8217;t like getting booed! And they *love* the warm waves of studio-audience affection they get when they just say &#8220;Beautiful!&#8221; and &#8220;Perfect! Ya did it again!&#8221;</p>

<p>I find it interesting that people can be poles apart when it comes to appreciating music. My favorite season ever is Season 9 because the singer-songwriter types are the closest to my heart. They&#8217;re like my soul mates. There were so many unique and indie contestants last year such as Crystal, Didi, and Lilly.</p>

<p>True &#8230; except that Lilly didn&#8217;t even make it into the Top 12. &#8230;. That fact alone kind of bummed me about Season 9, I admit! (and then Didi and Siobhan, for example, kept disappointing me &#8230;)</p>

<p>Amen to this. I would add Katelyn Epperly to the list. It was like having a fresh, young edition of Lilith Fair on tv.</p>
<p>Specially Lilly, the one and only real hipster that Idol&#8217;s ever had. Girl&#8217;s got great taste, if she had been on the Top 12 I&#8217;m sure she would have given us at least a couple of &#8220;moments&#8221;. Such a haunting voice!</p>
<p>But she was right, the kind of people that appreciate her are not the ones voting, or even watching the show. This year&#8217;s final 2 is a confirmation of that.</p>
<p>I still prefer many of the girls on last year&#8217;s top 24 to any of the contestants from this season. It&#8217;s a taste thing, I guess.</p>

<p>Fantastic Finale show! Worth watching on TV (I&#8217;ve been following the season via this blog&#8217;s videos and occasionally the live stream posting). Extremely entertaining, musical diversity, comedy, beautiful sets.  </p>
<p>Beyonce&#8217;s solo was the first time I ever heard her truly connect emotionally with a song &#8211; she tends to be more of a technical &amp; vocal-acrobatics singer but w/o a soul &#8211; that performance shows that she&#8217;s really grown.</p>

1. The demographic of American Idol viewers is mostly viewers from the Southern States (South) (see wikipedia).<br />
2. The rating trend was downward. This year revenue is down 17% than last year. New producer (Nigel Lythgoe) has to do something about it.<br />
3. Out of 10 winners 8 winners were from the South (2 of them are very successful: Kelly Clarkson &amp; Carrie Underwood; the majority of their music-genre fans is from the South).<br />
4. There were 2 ‘potential’ contenders from the South in Top 13 (Lauren Alaina &amp; Scott McCreery; their music-genre is popular in the South).<br />
5. The voting system is NOT verifiable. Even if a contestant is considered very talented by the music experts/industry/viewers, he/she can be voted off, and suspicion about manipulation is almost zero. Because in people’s mind: “Because viewers can vote unlimited, contestant whose fans vote like ‘crazy’ will win, contestants who can’t generate excitement will lose.” This is where TPTB has the ‘loophole’: they reserve the right to disqualify, block or remove any votes from any individual. They have created their own privilege to steer the direction of the outcome of the show to what they deem necessary for the sake of the show. Viewers are just ‘pawns’ and ‘scapegoats’ (“How come they are so stupid to vote him/her off?”; Remember: ‘cougars’/’tweens/teens were to be blamed ) The contestants are the talented young musicians who are in desperate need to survive. Absolutely they are thankful for being exposed to millions and got (meagerly) paid too (they get $1000/week; in comparison: host, judges get between $10M-$20M for each of them; who knows how big is the chunk for TPTB) Remember: without these contestants, there is no show. But they better shut up. The repercussion is huge.<br />
6. The goal of “All New” American Idol was to reverse the downward trend. How? Courting the viewers from the South. How? The winner has to be from the South.<br />
7. Eliminate all 5 female contestants (they all are NOT from the South)<br />
8. Then Paul, Stefano, Casey, Jacob, James, Haley.<br />
9. Lauren &amp; Scotty: in the final.<br />
1st &amp; 2nd from the South. Double whammy. Rating soaring (majority of viewers (South) love it). Trend reversed (even without Simon, wow). Goal achieved. Huge success. $$$ pouring in. ‘Long live American $dol (&amp; N$gel)’!</p>

<p>Taylor Hicks is my #1</p>
<p>If James had won this year, he&#8217;d be #2</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really particular about the order of the others. Like them all. (I am glad Scotty won, and I downloaded his single this morning. Honestly, I really like it and hope he sells a million plus)!</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t speak for the other two but as a Kris fan, I can&#8217;t complain; he was on the show twice last year (charity performance for Haiti, single and group number on the finale). This year, he was asked in one interview if he&#8217;d be on, said that &#8220;we talked about it,&#8221; but apparently it wasn&#8217;t the time. I don&#8217;t know what he would have done, a cover? Why? When he has new music, he&#8217;ll be there.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I don&#8217;t agree with the parking attendant analogy, I guess. <img src='http://3888.voxcdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I think the Lee thing was weird. Of course he should have been asked to appear, even briefly, on camera. There&#8217;s a precedent for the reigning Idol to make one last appearance before the new one is crowned &#8211; so why not just do it?</p>

<p>The key to winning is included in your post &#8211; don&#8217;t be bad, ever. Not everyone who&#8217;s always good wins, but it can&#8217;t hurt.</p>
<p>Personally I thought this was a weak group; I don&#8217;t think he would have won in another year (a year where he would have been more challenged by the genres, the judges, or the other contestants) &#8211; but this was the year, and he did win.</p>

So many non-Idol related performances!  There was no purpose for Gaga, Spiderman, and Beyonce&#8217;s 2nd performance beyond self-promotion.  Yes, I realize 99% Idol performances are <strong>about</strong> promotion, but those had no connection to anything Idol related.  I was shocked that Scotty and Lauren didn&#8217;t sing a duet, even a reprise of one from earlier in the season.  And I was hoping that Lauren would do &#8220;Don&#8217;t Want To Miss a Thing&#8221; with Steven.  I can think of countless different ways the Idols (past and present) could have been utilized for the finale instead of pop stars with their own agendas.  The whole thing was just disconnected and, for the most part, unsatisfying.  Very disappointing.</p>

<p>Thanks girlygirl. Finally found Kris just after I read the comment that he was wearing glasses.<br />
I, too was waiting for Cory to give shout-out to Kris. <img src='http://3888.voxcdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' />   Oh well.</p>
