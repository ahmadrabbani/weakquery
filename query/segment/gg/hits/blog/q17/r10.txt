Bonds was not satisfied with breaking the now three year old single season home run record. He also set new records for slugging percentage (.863), walks (171), and home runs per at bat (6.52). He broke his personal record with one-hundred thirty-one runs batted in and finished the season with a .328 batting average. His on base percentage (.515), the best in the National League since John McGraw in 1900. Bonds became the oldest player to lead a league in home runs and also became the oldest player to reach the fifty, sixty, and seventy home run plateaus. The record breaking long ball came off of Los Angeles' Chan Ho Park on October 5. The new high did not last long, as Bonds went yard two innings later. Bonds finished up with one more trip around the bases two days later, leaving the new record at seventy-three. Bonds continued his dominance over the following years, but never again reached his 2001 numbers. Baseball Almanac is proud to present those seventy-three unforgettable home runs.    "When he (Wilfredo Rodriguez) threw the first pitch, I just was 'Wow.' It's really rare when you see left-handers that throw harder than Billy Wagner or Randy Johnson. He doesn't throw as hard as them, but he's not that far off. When he threw the first pitch, I was like, 'Whoa, this guy throws harder than it looked like when he was warming up.'" - Barry Bonds        73 Single Season Home Runs by Barry Bonds  The Unforgettable 73    #    Date    Pitcher    Team (AWAY)    Inn    Outs    Count    RBI    Length    1   04-02-2001    Woody Williams    San Diego   5   th   1  0-0  1  420' LCF    2   04-12-2001    Adam Eaton    SAN DIEGO   4   th   1  1-0  1  417' RCF    3   04-13-2001    Jamey Wright    MILWAUKEE   1   st   1  0-1  2  440' RCF    4   04-14-2001    Jimmy Haynes    MILWAUKEE   5   th   1  2-0  3  410' RF    5   04-15-2001    David Weathers    MILWAUKEE   8   th   2  1-1  1  390' LCF    6   04-17-2001    Terry Adams    Los Angeles   8   th   0  2-0  2  417' RF    7   04-18-2001    Chan Ho Park    Los Angeles   7   th   2  0-0  1  420' RCF    8   04-20-2001    Jimmy Haynes    Milwaukee   4   th   1  0-0  2  410' LCF    9   04-24-2001    Jim Brower    Cincinnati   3   rd   1  3-2  2  380' RCF    10   04-26-2001    Scott Sullivan    Cincinnati   8   th   2  3-2  2  430' CF    11   04-29-2001    Manny Aybar    Chicago   4   th   2  2-1  1  370' RF    12   05-02-2001    Todd Ritchie    PITTSBURGH   5   th   2  3-2  2  420' LCF    13   05-03-2001    Jimmy Anderson    PITTSBURGH   1   st   1  3-1  2  420' LCF    14   05-04-2001    Bruce Chen    PHILADELPHIA   6   th   1  1-1  2  360' RF    15   05-11-2001    Steve Trachsel    New York   4   th   0  3-2  1  410' RCF    16   05-17-2001    Chuck Smith    FLORIDA   3   rd   1  0-1  2  420' RCF    17   05-18-2001    Mike Remlinger    ATLANTA   8   th   1  0-1  1  391' RF    18   05-19-2001    Odalis Perez    ATLANTA   3   rd   0  3-2  1  416' RCF    19   05-19-2001    Jose Cabrera    ATLANTA   7   th   0  2-0  1  440' RCF    20   05-19-2001    Jason Marquis    ATLANTA   8   th   2  3-0  1  410' LCF    21   05-20-2001    John Burkett    ATLANTA   1   st   2  2-2  1  415' CF    22   05-20-2001    Mike Remlinger    ATLANTA   7   th   1  0-0  1  436' CF    23   05-21-2001    Curt Schilling    ARIZONA   4   th   0  2-0  1  430' CF    24   05-22-2001    Russ Springer    ARIZONA   9   th   0  0-0  2  410' LCF    25   05-24-2001    John Thomson    Colorado   3   rd   2  2-2  1  400' RF    26   05-27-2001    Denny Neagle    Colorado   1   st   1  3-1  2  390' RF    27   05-30-2001    Robert Ellis    Arizona   2   nd   0  0-0  1  420' RF    28   05-30-2001    Robert Ellis    Arizona   6   th   1  3-1  2  410' CF    29   06-01-2001    Shawn Chacon    COLORADO   3   rd   1  2-0  2  420' RF    30   06-04-2001    Bobby Jones    San Diego   4   th   0  2-1  1  410' CF    31   06-05-2001    Wascar Serrano    San Diego   3   rd   1  1-1  2  410' LCF    32   06-07-2001    Brian Lawrence    San Diego   7   th   2  1-1  2  450' CF    33   06-12-2001    Pat Rapp    Anaheim   1   st   2  0-0  1  320' RF    34   06-14-2001    Lou Pote    Anaheim   6   th   1  2-1  1  430' RCF    35   06-15-2001    Mark Mulder    Oakland   1   st   2  3-1  1  380' LCF    36   06-15-2001    Mark Mulder    Oakland   6   th   1  2-1  1  430' RCF    37   06-19-2001    Adam Eaton    SAN DIEGO   5   th   1  2-1  1  375' RCF    38   06-20-2001    Rodney Myers    SAN DIEGO   8   th   0  2-1  2  347' RF    39   06-23-2001    Darryl Kile    ST.
