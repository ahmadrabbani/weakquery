Barry Bonds is still mad that Marc Ecko bought his record-breaking home run ball and branded it with an asterisk. So mad in fact, that he has decided to boycott the Hall of Fame inductions if the Hall of Fame upholds their decision to display the ball. Instead of shocking and disturbing the baseball community, baseball fans are rejoicing. We don’t have to see Barry Bonds glorified ever again!   Sure there will be some press this offseason as Bonds looks for his American League saviors, but once the season starts, he won’t be doing much to make press. He’ll just be batting .275 with 30 home runs or so. Nothing special. He’ll keep doing that for five more season. (Or so he says: “ When I decide to retire five years from now, we’ll see where they are at that moment…”) By forgoing his probable spot at the Hall of Fame inductions, he’ll have no chance to give a self-congratulatory speech talking about how he faced so much adversity–racist fans, racist media, rich parents–to come out on top. He won’t be able to cry about how much he loves his dad and his godfather. He’ll just be whining to the media about how racist Marc Ecko is. Barry Bonds knows that most people don’t like him (because Americans are racist),  but he chose the wrong way to protest the branding. When Hank Aaron didn’t attend Bonds’ record-setting game, he annoyed Bonds, because Bonds wanted him there to watch his record fall. On the other hand, no one wants Bonds at the Hall of Fame inductions. But no matter what the public thinks, Bonds is standing by his principles: “You cannot give people the freedom, the right to alter history. You can’t do it.” Barry, Barry, Barry… If only you knew, that’s exactly why baseball fans hate you.
