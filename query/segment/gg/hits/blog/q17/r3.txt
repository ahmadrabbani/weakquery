The judge had declared a mistrial on those counts, and prosecutors had spent more than four months mulling whether to retry him.  That decision comes less than a week after United States District Court Judge Susan Illston ruled that  she would not dismiss Bonds’s conviction on an obstruction of justice charge. Bonds’s lawyers said he was improperly convicted for obstructing justice when the jury did not find him guilty of perjury, too, but Illston did not agree.  Bonds, whose lead lawyer, Allen Ruby, did not return an e-mail for comment, is likely to appeal that ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  A prosecutor, Jeff Nedrow, did not return a phone call seeking comment.  Bonds, the former San Francisco Giants slugger, is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 16 for the obstruction of justice conviction. He was  found guilty of impeding a federal investigation in 2003 when he provided intentionally evasive, false or misleading statements during the grand jury testimony he gave in connection with the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative steroids case.  That conviction carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence, though federal guidelines suggest 15 to 21 months. Bonds, however, is likely to be sentenced to only a fraction of that — if any time at all.  Regarding the perjury charges, a panel of eight women and four men voted for acquittal, 8 to 4, on the prosecutors’ allegations that Bonds knowingly lied when he said he never used steroids. The jury voted, 9 to 3, for acquittal on the charge that he knowingly lied when he said he never used human growth hormone.  On the third perjury charge, regarding whether anyone but his personal doctor ever injected him, Bonds was nearly convicted, with 11 of the 12 jurors finding him guilty of lying about it.
