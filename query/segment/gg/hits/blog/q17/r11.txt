Jurors said they concluded that Bonds had been evasive before the grand jury, but they disagreed on whether he had knowingly lied to the panel about using steroids or human growth hormones. One juror, a 60-year-old engineer who identified himself as Steve, said he was glad that the trial had taken place because he has a daughter who plays soccer. “I’d like to see a level playing field,” he said after the verdicts were read. The juror called the ballplayers who testified about their own drug use at the trial “true heroes. I believe there is one man who just couldn’t do it because of who he is.” Other jurors questioned the government’s case against the athlete. “I think the government feeling was they had a really big fish with Bonds and they wanted to finish what they started,” said jury foreman Fred Jacob, 56. “Maybe they tried a little too hard to make him guilty.” The verdict against the former San Francisco Giants star capped a nearly seven-year probe that focused on Bonds’ denials under oath about knowingly using performance-enhancing drugs. Bonds, 46, sat grim-faced when the verdict was read in a courtroom packed with reporters. The jury of eight women and four men, which began deliberating Friday morning, deadlocked on three counts of perjury. The trial culminates an era that saw the reputations of some of the nation's top athletes tarnished by disclosures of steroid and other drug use and that forced professional sports to grapple with calls for reform. The probe into Bonds began with an investigation into a Bay Area laboratory that was selling illegal steroids to professional athletes and expanded to include athletes suspected of lying to investigators. Bonds, holder of baseball’s hallowed record for most home runs, was the probe’s highest-profile quarry. His career record stands at 762 home runs, surpassing Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth.

Numbers of Children of Whites Falling Fast By SABRINA TAVERNISE Published: April 6, 2011 RECOMMEND TWITTER SIGN IN TO E-MAIL PRINT REPRINTS SHARE WASHINGTON — America’s population of white children, a majority now, will be in the minority during this decade, sooner than previously expected, according to a  new report. The Census Bureau had originally forecast that 2023 would be the tipping point  for the minority population under the age of 18. But rapid growth among Latinos,  Asians and people of more than one race has pushed it earlier, to 2019,  according to William Frey, the senior demographer at the Brookings Institution  who wrote the report about the shift, which has far-reaching political and  policy implications. The single largest increase was among Hispanics, whose birthrates are far above those of non-Hispanic whites, largely because the white population is aging and  proportionally has fewer women in their child-bearing years. The median age of  whites is 41, compared with 27 for Hispanics, the report said. As a result, America’s future will include a far more diverse young population,  and a largely white older generation. The contrast raises important policy  questions. Will the older generation pay for educating a younger generation that  looks less like itself? And while the young population is a potential engine of  growth for the economy, will it be a burden if it does not have access to  adequate education?  The population of white children fell by 4.3 million, or about 10 percent, in  the last decade, while the population of Hispanic and Asian children grew by 5.5  million, or about 38 percent, according to the report, which was based on 2010  Census numbers. The number of African-American children also fell, down by 2 percent. Over all,  minorities now make up 46.5 percent of the under-18 population. Whites are now the minority of child populations in 10 states, double the number  from the previous decade, according to the report, and in 35 cities, including  Atlanta, Phoenix and Orlando, Fla. Vermont had the largest drop in its child  population of any state. The changes also have political implications. Though whites are still 63 percent  of the population as a whole, that is down from 75.6 percent in 1990, and  minorities, particularly Hispanics, who now outnumber blacks, are becoming an  increasingly important part of the electorate.  Mr. Frey estimates that whites will slip into the minority by about 2041. The  number of whites grew by just 1.2 percent in the population as a whole in the  last decade, a fraction of the 43 percent growth among Latinos.

Oh, right - flaxseed oil (that had to be injected) with an arthritis cream kicker! Barry's real problem is assuming that people are stupid. I guess for some who have had privilege, talent and money, there's never enough. This is another case where millions don't buy morals. Of course, Bonds would have us believe that he is the victim of a vast conspiracy by the government, fans and the media. Bonds and his friend Greg Anderson both need to do some hard time. Maybe then they'll give up their ill-gotten gains, including the home run crown. If ever there was someone that deserved an asterisk next to his name, Bonds is the guy.
