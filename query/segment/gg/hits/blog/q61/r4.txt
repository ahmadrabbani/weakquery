Any one of these problems can impede replication processes or prevent them from happening entirely. These issues can also increase WAN infrastructure and support costs, which have a significant impact on the total cost of ownership (TCO) for offsite data protection. HDS resells Silver Peak's WAN optimization solution to address these challenges. By combining industry leading replication products with data center class WAN optimization, the two companies deliver a proven solution for offsite data replication. With the joint Silver Peak / HDS solution, enterprises can protect more data across longer distances. In addition, replication can be performed over cost effective shared WANs (e.g. MPLS and Internet VPNs), resulting in significant cost savings.   Below is a collection of collateral that discusses how Silver Peak can be deployed effectively with HDS backup and replication solutions, such as TrueCopy/HUR, HNAS, and HCP replication.
