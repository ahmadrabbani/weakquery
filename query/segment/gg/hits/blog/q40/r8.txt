There is also a viral email competition that shows mysterious footage of the Sci Fi office. Promotional trailers and behind-the-scenes footage support the movie.  The "Do you have a grudge?" themed weekend was developed by Sci Fi Brand Solutions and ZenithOptimedia and includes some of the best Japanse and Thai supernatural cinema, including the first back-to-back screening of 'The Ring' trilogy.  Does anyone know if this is a carbon-copy of the U.S. Sci Fi Channel's promo (or if they did one at all?) At any rate, the "weekend saturation" approach appears to have taken ground in Europe as well.
