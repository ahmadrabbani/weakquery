SCI FI Channel Announces Upcoming New Series TCAs: Comic book adaptation  Painkiller Jane, a new series from  Tick creator Ben Edlund and Boston Rob heading up a real life  X-Files are among the new offerings. July 14, 2006  July 15, 2006  July 14, 2006            by  Eric Goldman    Running for nearly three weeks straight, the TCA (Television Critics Association) summer press tour is a major endeavor, where nearly all the biggest channels -- from the broadcast networks to popular cable stations -- have presentations and panels discussing their upcoming programming, including new and returning series.   At the SCI FI Channel's TCA event, Mark Stern, the Executive Vice President of Original Programming, made several announcements about SCI FI's upcoming programs, noting that within the year, they intend to have seven original shows running during any given week. Details were released on many of these projects, which run the gamut from original dramas, to miniseries, animation and reality programming. Among the highlights:    SCI FI Investigates  : A new series that explores the sweeping and eclectic mysteries and legends that pervade our world. This six-part, one-hour weekly series is a real-life  X-Files , aggressively exploring the unexplained. Investigations are led by an array of subject-specific authorities including  Survivor and  Amazing Race alumnus and resident cynic "Boston" Rob Mariano. Mariano's fellow   SCI FI Investigates  teammates include, forensic expert Deborah Dobrydney, scientist Dr. Bill Doleman and author/historian Richard Dolan. Mariano is the resident "jack of all trades," offering pragmatic, resourceful input on a variety of investigations. Among the first group of topics the  SCI FI Investigates team will be examining are Bigfoot and Roswell. Premieres fall 2006.    The Lost Room  : It's  The Fugitive meets  The Twilight Zone in this contemporary sci-fi thriller. When homicide detective Joe Miller (Peter Krause,  Six Feet Under ) stumbles upon a seemingly innocuous motel room key, he unlocks the door to a world of unimaginable power and becomes the target of those who will stop at nothing to claim it. The motel room is a treasure trove of seemingly mundane objects, each of which actually possesses a unique power. And as Joe soon discovers, the motel room key is the most potent and coveted object of all. Shadowy organizations dedicated to collecting these charmed objects relentlessly pursue him, hoping to claim the key. When his daughter, played by Elle Fanning (yep, she's the sister of Dakota) vanishes inside the motel room, he also becomes the focus of a heated police investigation. Hunted and alone, Joe becomes the central player in a game to which he doesn't know the rules. Craig R. Baxley, who directed  The Triangle , and Michael Watkins, co-executive producer and director of  Prison Break , will share directing duties on   The Lost Room  , which is slated to premiere in December of 2006.    Painkiller Jane  : Based on the eponymous comic book created by Jimmy Palmiotti and Joe Quesada,   Painkiller Jane  is the story of Jane Vasko, a young researcher trying to make a difference as the world faces its greatest drug addiction epidemic. When Jane catches wind of a budding conspiracy, and a secret research program within her corporation, she turns DEA informant. Thus threatening to expose corruption within one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, Jane becomes a target. However, she is accidentally exposed to an experimental "cure" that renders her impervious to sickness and injury - but not pain. Unfortunately for Jane, these powers come at a price: she has less than a month left to live before the cure's unstable nature overtakes her. Jane continues to develop new abilities. After each injury, she heals stronger than she had been. But the pain remains and intensifies as she races to turn the tables on her pursuers, and save her own life. The series will premiere on SCI FI starting in January 2007. The cast has not yet been finalized.    Outpost  : This sweeping adventure series from executive producer Lynda Obst ( Contact ), centers on a group of private explorers in the near future that takes over an abandoned NASA research base after the government has abandoned space exploration as too expensive. The intrepid explorers travel to a distant planet in our solar system to establish a potentially lucrative off-world colony. But when they discover an ancient artifact buried deep beneath the planet's surface, the real adventure begins! This epic miniseries is written by Eric Jendresen ( Band of Brothers ) and produced by astronomer David Grinspoon.    Devil's Advocate  : From Executive Producer Mark Burnett ( Survivor ) and Dreamworks Television comes a one-hour conspiracy thriller from Executive Producer/Writer Jonas McCord ( Earth: Final Conflict ) about a theology professor who is thrust into the world of secret societies, religious espionage and genetic research. Hired by a global corporation, but motivated by his own personal search for the truth, our professor forms an eclectic team of 'devil's advocates' who are charged with deciding whether bizarre cases can be explained naturally, or whether there are larger, more supernatural forces at work.    Witch Doctor  : From Ben Edlund, the creative force behind the comic book series  The Tick , comes a dramedy that mixes the worlds of medicine and the supernatural with warm human comedy. As David seeks alternative treatments when traditional western medicine cannot cure him, he stumbles upon a little-known doctor with remarkable healing powers. His suspicions that the doctor's powers extend into unknown realms are confirmed when David is unexpectedly imbued with the doctor's powers. Suddenly able to see the supernatural world that exists unseen all around us, he reluctantly takes over the clinic and a secret medical network for the magical world. Teaming with a female healer, David investigates the bizarre, to help those that traditional medicine cannot, all while navigating the world of the supernatural!    Stoner  : From Jeff Kline ( Jackie Chan Adventures ),   Stoner  takes place in a Los Angeles where superheroes really exist and are afforded all the trappings of fame and celebrity. When a "normal" slacker named Greg Pincus is mistakenly thrust into the limelight as the newest superhuman on the block, he must make a decision: reveal the truth about his lack of actual super powers and return to safe obscurity, or figure out a way to continue the charade and live the high-life... without getting himself killed.    Alien Invasion  : A hilarious and innovative computer-animated comedy from Dave Goetsch (Executive Producer/Showrunner,  3rd Rock from the Sun ). Blending CG animation with live-action backgrounds, this half-hour comedy tracks the exploits of two hapless aliens and their attempts to take over the world from their home base in Venice, California - a place where they aren't even close to being the strangest folks on the block.
