&nbsp;&nbsp; Irving, whose theories denying that the holocaust
happened have caused<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; outrage among Jewish communities and historians
worldwide, received<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; his refusal notice from the Australian government last
week, a year<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; after applying for a tourist visa.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was previously refused entry in 1993 and 1996.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock rejected Irving's
application for<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a visa after he failed the character test.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Irving, whose daughter Beatrice is an Australian citizen
living in<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brisbane, said he had engaged a Perth firm of solicitors
to fight his<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; refusal, even though the government said he could not
appeal.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp; "Thousands of Australians want to hear me speak,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; they have been denied that right," Irving said on
Friday.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Arsonists are allowed to visit. Weirdos and whackos
with real<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; criminal records are allowed to visit but someone with
an artificial<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; criminal record is not allowed.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "My criminal record is artificial. The law I broke in
Germany doesn't<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; exist anywhere else in the world."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In its decision, the Australian High Commission in
London said it<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; could not be assumed Irving would abide by Australian
law.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr Irving's behaviour demonstrates a defiance and
contempt for the<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; laws of some of the countries he visited," it wrote in
its report.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "His conduct was deemed serious enough by those
countries to see him<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; deported and excluded.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is difficult to determine that Mr Irving wouldn't
behave similarly<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; whilst in Australia."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Irving was convicted in Germany in 1992 for defaming the
memory of the<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; dead and was expelled from the country the following
year.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was also deported from Canada in 1992 for lying to an
Immigration<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Adjudicator and in 1994, a British High Court judge
found he gave<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; false evidence.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He also owes the Australian government $35,140 after
previous failed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; appeals.<BR>
