               taxpayers who put up with it because of the way the Israelis or
               Jews have suffered. No one is going to like it when they find out

               based were as follows. On 21 April 1990, at a meeting attended by
               about 800 people of the Deutsches Jugendbildungeswerk at the

                    the Second World War...For this the German tax payers have

                    murdering of Jews in the `Third Reich' defames every Jews
                    and slanders the memory of all Jews gassed in Auschwitz. By
                    calling the mass gassing of Jews in Auschwitz an invention,
                    the Accused [the Plaintiff] denies the Jews the inhumane
                    fate to which they were subjected in the `Third Reich'
                    purely on account of their origins...He knew that the
                    so-called Auschwitz lie would be assessed as defamation and
                    prosecuted...The Accused is seeking only superficially to
                    paint a picture at variance with established research and in
                    truth is clearly seeking to deny the mass murder of the
                    Jewish people in the Third Reich...The Accused can only
                    reach his conviction by failing to heed the historical fact
                    of the gassing of the Jews in Auschwitz...and by relying on
                    a few revisionist outsiders and pseudo natural history
                    propaganda magazines apologetic to the National-Socialist
                    cause. Had the Accused applied his endeavours in an
                    unprejudiced manner, not marked by any ideology of the
                    Right, he would always have been in a position to assess
                    accurately the numerous historical sources and
                    witnesses...To the extent that the Accused is relying on his
                    belief, the Criminal Chamber has not taken this into account
                    to reduce the fine...since the gassing of the Jews in
                    Auschwitz is such a publicly known historical fact that only
                    people - like the Accused - who refuse to acknowledge this
                    dreadful truth are able to arrive at such a belief.</font>
                    <p><font color="#000000">To the detriment of the Accused it
                    has to be said that a denial of the fate of the Jews in
                    Auschwitz represents a massive insult to Jewish people and a
                    grave defamation of those who died. The Criminal Chamber has
                    also appraised as aggravating the fact that the Accused from
                    his own testimony disseminated the so-called Auschwitz lie
                    even subsequent to the events at issue here.... <i><b>there
                    is a risk of the generation which did not experience as
                    direct contemporary witness the situation prevailing during
                    the National Socialist period and the persecution of the
                    Jews accepting this line of thinking without questioning
                    it... It also had to be taken into account that the Accused
                    as a writer and historian is also in a position to give the
                    impression that his thoughts are backed up by scientific
                    evidence. There is the risk that by giving voice in this way
                    he will be used by revisionists of the neo Nazi movement as
                    a historical-scientific signboard and thereby introduce

               his fellow speakers was Dr Robert Faurisson, author of numerous
               revisionist works, and sued (according to IHR literature

               Dr Faurisson was in fact convicted by the French courts for the
               libel of denying the Holocaust. Dr Faurisson has claimed the
               &quot;so-called gassing&quot; of the Jews was a &quot;gigantic
               politico-financial swindle whose beneficiaries are the state of
               Israel and international Zionism&quot; and whose chief victims
               were the German people and the Palestinians. He has further
               claimed that the Nazi decree making it mandatory for Jews to wear
               a yellow star was a measure to ensure the safety of German
               soldiers because Jews engaged in espionage, terrorism, black
               market operations and arms trafficking; and that Jewish children
               were required to wear the yellow star from the age of 6, because
               they too were engaged in illicit or resistance activities against
               the Germans;

               ....This how it was when I was in Toronto a couple of years ago.
               I was called as an expert witness as a historian to give evidence
               at the Ernst Zundel case, where Zundel's researchers showed me
               the[link to Nizkor]&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/faqs/leuchter">Leuchter
               Report</a>, the laboratory tests on the crematoria and the gas
               chambers. As a person who, at University in London, studied
               chemistry and physics and the exact sciences, I knew that this
               was an exact result. There was no way around it. And suddenly all
               that I'd read in the archives clicked into place. You have to
               accept that, if there is no evidence anywhere in the archives
               that there were any gassings going on; that if there's not one
               sing German document that refers to the gassings of human beings
               - not one wartime German document; and if there is no reference
               anywhere in the German archives to anybody giving orders for the
               gassings of people, and if, on the other hand, the forensic tests
               of the laboratories, of the crematoria, and the gas chambers and
               Auschwitz and so on, show that there is no trace, no significant
               residue whatsoever of a cyanide compound, then this can all only
               mean one thing.

               <br>

               <br>
               So how do we explain the fact that for forty-five years since the
               end of World War Two, we have all, internationally, globally,
               been beset by a common guilt: the idea that the human race was
               responsible for liquidating six million human beings in gas
               chambers? Well, the answer is: we have been subjected to the
               biggest propaganda offensive that the human race has ever known.
               It's been conducted with such finesse, with such refinement, with
               such financial clout, that we have not been able to recognize it
               as a propaganda offensive - from start to finish. And yet there
               are these weapons cruising past us on the horizon - in all their
               ugliness - and the biggest weapon, of course, of all in this
               propaganda campaign against the truth since 1945 has been the
               great battleship Auschwitz! And we have now, at last, the
               historical profession - above all, the Revisionist historical
               profession - have found as our own task, the major task:
               &quot;Sink the Auschwitz!&quot;</font></p>
               <p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;I warned you that I was going to
               show no respect for tests in the first part of this talk. Sink
               the Auschwitz! But we haven't had to sink the Auschwitz, because
               the crew of the Auschwitz, Beate Klarsfeld, the Wiesenthals, Elie
               Wiesel and the rest of them, have been struggling on the bridge
               and battling with each other - boxing and engaging in fisticuffs
               - and the Auschwitz has been steering itself amongst the
               icebergs, and finally it has begun to scuttle itself. They have
               begun to haul down the flag of the battleship Auschwitz. They've
               taken down the placard, [link to Nizkor]&nbsp; </font><a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/techniques-of-denial/four-million-01.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">they've
               taken down the memorial to the four million</font></a><font color="#000000">,
               and they've replaced it with a rather smaller memorial to one
               million....</font></p>
               <p><font color="#000000">....That's what's happening in Germany
               now. They're still sticking to the six million figure. And
               they're still being told that they were gassed. Although all the
               evidence runs the other way. To me, Auschwitz is unimportant -
               I'm happy that the ship is scuttling itself. It's vanishing. It's
               going to be left like the battleship Arizona at Pearl - if you
               ever go to Hawaii and have a look at it - with just its mast
               sticking out of the water to mark where once a great legend
               stood. And when people go there a hundred years from now and say:
               &quot;Down there is the most incredible legend that people
               believed for fifty years: it's the great battleship Auschwitz, it
               was scuttled by its crew!&quot;</font>

               expertise in the matters upon which he purported to give an
               expert view in the Report, and his evidence as a self-styled
               expert was (rightly) rejected (save to a very limited extent) by
               the Canadian Court, for that reason. Moreover, the scientific
               validity and methodology of the Report were fundamentally flawed.
               Though Leuchter claimed an expertise in engineering, he had none.
               Indeed in June 1991, 2 weeks before Leuchter was due to go on
               trial in Massachussets for practising or offering to practice
               engineering without a licence, Leuchter signed a consent
               agreement admitting that he was not and never had been a
               professional engineer, and had fraudulently presented himself to
               various states as an engineer with the ability to consult on
               matters concerning execution technology. Leuchter further
               acknowledged that though he was not an engineer and had never
               taken an engineering licensing test, he had produced reports,
               including the Report containing his engineering opinions.
               Henceforth, Leuchter agreed to cease and desist, presenting
               himself as an engineer and issuing any reports, including the

                    Old fashioned historians have always conducted endless
                    learned debates about meanings and interpretations, and the
                    more indolent among them have developed a subsidiary Black

                    Deutschmarks in voluntary reparations from West Germany,
                    essentially in atonement for the &quot;gas chambers of
                    Auschwitz&quot;). And this myth will not die easily: Too
                    many hundreds of millions of honest, intelligent people have
                    been duped by the well-financed and brilliantly successful
                    post-war publicity campaign which followed on from the
                    original ingenious plan of the British Psychological Warfare
                    Executive (PWE) in 1942 to spread to the world the
                    propaganda story that the Germans were using &quot;gas
                    chambers&quot; to kill millions of Jews and other

                    the PWE minuted the Cabinet secretly that despite the
                    stories they were putting out, there was not the slightest
                    evidence that such contraptions existed, and he continued
                    with a warning that stories from Jewish sources in this
                    connection were particularly suspect.</font>
                    <p><font color="#000000">As a historian, I have, on
                    occasion, had recourse to fraud laboratories to test
                    controversial documents for their authenticity. In the late
                    1960s I discarded certain diaries of Vice Admiral Wilhelm
                    Canaris, offered to myself and the publishers William
                    Collins Ltd, since Messrs. Hehner &amp; Cox Ltd of the City
                    of London advised me that the ink used for one signature did
                    not exist during the war years. It was I who exposed the
                    &quot;Hitler Diaries&quot; as fakes at Der Stern's famous
                    International Press Conference in Hamburg in April 1983.</font>

                    chambers&quot; - the holiest shrines of this new Twentieth
                    Century religion - to chemical tests to see if there was any
                    trace of cyanide compounds in the walls.</font>

                    set out in this report: while significant quantities of
                    cyanide compounds were found in the small de-lousing
                    facilities of the camp where the proprietary (and lethal)
                    Zyklon B compound was used, as all are agreed, to disinfect
                    the plague-ridden clothing of all persons entering these
                    brutal slave-labour camps, no significant trace whatsoever
                    was found in the buildings which international opinion - for
                    it is not more than that - has always labelled as the camp's
                    infamous gas chambers. Nor, as the report's gruesomely
                    expert author makes plain, could the design and construction
                    of those buildings have made their use as mass gas-chambers
                    feasible under any circumstances.</font>

                    the first time when called as an expert witness at the
                    Zundel trial in Toronto in April 1988, the laboratory
                    reports were shattering. There could be no doubt as to their
                    integrity. I myself would, admittedly, have preferred to see
                    more rigorous methods used in identifying and certifying the
                    samples taken for analysis, but I accept without reservation
                    the difficulties that the examining team faced on location
                    in what is now Poland; chiselling out the samples from the
                    hallowed site under the very noses of the new camp guards.
                    The video tapes made simultaneously by the team - which I
                    have studied - provide compelling visual evidence of the
                    scrupulous methods that they used.</font>

                    no economically viable alternative but to believe, that the
                    Nazis used &quot;gas chambers&quot; at Auschwitz to kill
                    human beings. But it is now up to them to explain to me as

               Plaintiff's book, &quot;<i>Hitler's War</i>&quot; was published.
               The purpose of <i>Hitler's War</i>, informing its massive
               documentary presentation, was to present a revised picture of
               Hitler by transferring both the political and military errors and
               the crimes ascribed to him to others: the errors to his generals,

               <p><font color="#000000">80. In the Goebbels' book, published by
               Focal Point in 1996, the Plaintiff continues his exculpation of
               Hitler, this time transferring not merely the responsibility for
               the extermination camps but the policy of anti-semitism itself
               from Hitler to Goebbels: his method is to dwell on Goebbels'
               anti-semitism, and to attenuate, or slide-over that of Hitler.
               Thus, when Goebbels in his diary reported Hitler as being in
               support of the most radical programme of extermination, the
               Plaintiff commented (at pp.386-7) that where as Goebbels may be
               believed when he expressed his own views, his citation of
               Hitler's statements to him need not be taken seriously: the
               diarist was merely repeating &quot;threadbare phrases&quot;. The
               Plaintiff makes much of the fact that Hitler was not pleased by
               the violent anti-semitic riots which were orchestrated by
               Goebbels - the so-called &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; on 9 November
               1938 (and see (36) below). By this variation of emphasis, the
               Plaintiff builds up a portrait of Goebbels as the driving force
               of Nazi anti-semitism, the &quot;Mastermind of the Third
               Reich&quot;, goading his reluctant F�hrer into ever more radical
               actions against the Jews. As in &quot;Hitler's War&quot;, Hitler
               is portrayed by the Plaintiff as a weak leader, fundamentally
               benevolent and constructive, but driven to occasional violent
               actions by evil or treacherous counsellors.</font></p>

               <p><font color="#000000">81. In that context, the Plaintiff omits
               the history of Hitler's rabid anti-semitism. The first known
               political utterance of Hitler is a paper on the Jewish question,
               written in 1919. In it, Hitler demanded that the Jewish question
               be solved, not by &quot;emotional&quot; attacks - sporadic
               pogroms which lead nowhere - but by &quot;rational anti-semitism&quot;,
               &quot;the anti-semitism of reason&quot;, &quot;planned judicial
               opposition&quot; whose &quot;ultimate goal is the removal of Jews
               altogether. An even stronger statement of Hitler's intentions
               towards the Jews before he knew Goebbels is expressed in a
               newspaper interview from 1922 as quoted in Fleming's &quot;Hitler
               and the Final Solution&quot;, 1984, p.17:</font>
               <blockquote>
                    <p><font color="#000000">&quot;Once I really am in power, my
                    first and foremost task will be the annihilation of the
                    Jews. As soon as I have the power to do so, I will have
                    gallows built in rows - at the Marienplatz in Munich, for
                    example - as many as traffic allows.</font></p>
                    <p><font color="#000000">Then the Jews will be hanged
                    indiscriminately, and they will remain hanging until they
                    stink; they will hang there as long as the principles of
                    hygiene permit. As soon as they have been untied, the next
                    batch will be strung up, and so on down the line, until the
                    last Jew in Munich has been exterminated. Other cities will
                    follow suit, precisely in this fashion, until all Germany is
                    completely cleansed of Jews.&quot;</font></p>
               </blockquote>
               <p><font color="#000000">In &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Hitler was
               explicit: the First World War, he stated, might not have been
               lost if a sufficient number of Jews had been eliminated at the
               start of it by poison-gas. Both these statements were uttered
               before Hitler had met Goebbels. Hitler's last political message
               to the world, the last sentence of his last political testament,
               dictated shortly before his suicide, was an adjuration to the
               German people &quot;above all [emphasis added] ... implacably to
               oppose the universal poisoner of all nations, international
               Jewry.&quot; None of these statements are cited by the Plaintiff
               in the Goebbels' book (even in Hitler's War, where the Plaintiff
               cites part of Hitler's last testament, he fails to mention that
               last solemn adjuration).</font></p>

               The omissions, distortions and misrepresentations must be
               deliberate, and they all tend in the same direction: i.e. to
               present Nazism and Hitler in particular in a more favourable
               light and Britain, Churchill in particular, in an unfavourable
               light. Thus, Hitler, without any evidence, is cleared of at least
               some of the responsibility for The Final Solution and his anti-semitic
               is down-played; Churchill, without any evidence, is stated to
               have assassinated General Sikorski. Hitler, the destroyer of
               Europe, whose favourite words were &quot;austrotten&quot; and
               &quot;vernichten&quot;, who sought to destroy whole peoples and
               obliterate whole cities, even in the end Germany itself, is
               presented as a constructive statesman. Churchill, who resisted
               him, is described by the Plaintiff (at p.xv in his book
               &quot;Churchill's War&quot;) as &quot;rarely a creator, always a
               destroyer - of cities, of monuments, of works of art, of

          Gentlemen, you have the odious Gabriel Schoenfeld�s postings on

          First (b): if she chose to peddle her lies -- many of which she has
          not even attempted to justify in court -- in Britain for her own
          personal profit, then she cannot squeal if I use the offices of the
          British law courts to seek

          <br>
          relief. Unlike me, she did not have the courage to go into the witness
          box to expose her work to scrutiny and cross-examination. Her chosen
          &quot;experts&quot; turned out to be very hollow friends indeed, with
          a very limited knowledge of history (and in some cases, even of the
          German language!)

          I wonder how many of you fine gentlemen are willing to do that -- to
          give away your priceless research -- in books you have sweated over
          for up to ten or twenty years?

          <br>
          &gt;

          <br>
          Oh, I forgot: Mr Mott doesn�t publish the writings of �deniers�
          on his discussion group. Just the ad hominem attacks on them. Very
          broadminded of him. How very un-fascist. Never mind, you read this all
          the same.

                    <font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Arrested while on a visit to Austria and charged with 
          having denied the Holocaust, David Irving, age 67, was tried in a 
          Vienna criminal court on February 20th 2006 and&nbsp; sentenced to three 
          years in prison. He was fortunate. The Austrian prosecutors had argued 
                    for a longer sentence. The charge against Irving was based on a speech&nbsp; and 
          interview that he gave in Austria in 1989, at which time he had 
          claimed that there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz.<br>
                    <br>
                    In court Irving pled guilty to 
          the charge but claimed that  since 1989 he had changed his mind and now 
          believed that millions of Jews actually had been murdered by the 
          Nazis. Irving's timely change of view was judged to have been 
          generated by his desire to evade sentencing. It carried no weight with 
          the court. Peter Liebetreu,&nbsp; the presiding judge, stated that &quot;The 
          court did not consider the defendant to have genuinely changed his 
          mind....The regret he showed was considered to be mere lip service to 
          the law.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    "Hearing about the verdict, 
          Deborah Lipstadt&nbsp; told the BBC News website: &quot;I am not happy when 
                    censorship wins, and I don't believe in winning battles via 
                    censorship...The way of fighting Holocaust deniers is with 
                    history and with truth&quot;
                    <br><br>
               Irving was successful in appealing the verdict. On December 20th 
               2006 the Upper State Court of Vienna reduced his sentence to 
               probation; he was expelled from Austria and warned never to 
               return. David Irving was originally sentenced to 3 years; he was 
               released after having been in prison for 13 months.</font></tt></tt><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"></b></font></p>
