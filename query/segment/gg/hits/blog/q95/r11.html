 <strong>David John Cawdell Irving</strong> (born  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/March:24.htm">March 24</a>,  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/1938.htm">1938</a>) is one of the most accomplished and successful proponents of  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Historical:revisionism.htm">historical</a> and  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Holocaust:revisionism.htm">Holocaust revisionism</a>. Author of controversial works such as <em>Hitlers War</em> and <em>The Destruction of Dresden</em>, Irving is a non-academic  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Autodidacticism.htm">self-taught</a>  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Historian.htm">historian</a> who from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s was a leading  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/United:Kingdom.htm">British</a> author on  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/World:War:II.htm">World War II</a>. In the mid-1980s he started openly associating with  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Neo:Nazi.htm">Neo-Nazi</a> and extremist groups, and his reputation began to wane.  In the late 1990s he sued the prominent Holocaust historian  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Deborah:Lipstadt.htm">Deborah Lipstadt</a> for listing him as a  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Holocaust:denier.htm">Holocaust denier</a> in her book <em>Denying the Holocaust</em>; after a much publicized trial Irving lost and was found to be a Holocaust denier by the court.<p>Among the Holocaust deniers, Irving is perhaps the only one who for some time managed to keep up the reputation of a serious, if controversial, historian. Irving is considered an icon to many in the Holocaust denial camp, but after the Lipstadt trial verdict he has fought an increasingly lonely battle.  He has since been barred from entering many countries.

<!--PAR--><a name=":The:Destruction:of:Dresden:"></a><h2>2 "The Destruction of Dresden"</h2>
<p>Irving soon dropped out of college and went to  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Germany.htm">Germany</a> where he worked in a Thyssen steel works in the  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Ruhr.htm">Ruhr</a> and learned  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/German:language.htm">German</a>.  He then left Germany and moved to Franco's Spain where he worked as a clerk at an airbase near  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Madrid.htm">Madrid</a>. Establishing contacts with Europes far-right, in  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/1962.htm">1962</a> he wrote a series of thirty-seven articles on the Allied bombing war, <em>Wie Deutschlands Städte Starben</em>, for the German right-wing journal <em>Neue Illustrierte</em>. These served as the basis for his first book <em>The Destruction of Dresden</em>, published in  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/1963.htm">1963</a>.  In it he examined the Allied  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Bombing:of:Dresden:in:World:War:II.htm">bombing of Dresden</a> during the final months of World War II. By the  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/1960s.htm">1960s</a>, a debate about the morality of the  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Carpet:bombing.htm">carpet bombing</a> of German cities and civilian population had already begun, especially in the UK. Hence, the public was receptive to Irving's persuasively written book, illustrated with graphic pictures. The book became an international bestseller.
</p><p>In the first edition of the book Irving's figures for deaths in  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Dresden.htm">Dresden</a> (which he initially reported as estimated authoritatively at 135,000, and which he himself estimated at between 100,000 and 250,000) were an order of magnitude higher than anyone else's.  Nonetheless, these figures became widely accepted and were repeated in many standard references and encyclopedias.  Over the next three decades later editions of the book gradually modified that figure downwards to a range of 50,000-100,000, but during that time Irving also made a number of public statements indicating that 100,000 or more Germans had been killed. It was not until the hearing of Irving's libel suit against  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Deborah:Lipstadt.htm">Deborah Lipstadt</a> in  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/2000.htm">2000</a> that the figures were discredited.  Today, the  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Bombing:of:Dresden:in:World:War:II.htm">Dresden bombing</a> casualty figures are estimated at about 40,000 dead.
