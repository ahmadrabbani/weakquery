Sometimes it's farcical but occasionally it's something evil that oozes out into the light of day from a dark place in the human soul. That's the case with David Irving. Irving started off as a respected World War II historian until he became the world's foremost Holocaust denier.  Irving is back in the news with another assault on human decency:  Irving will be shadowed by the   Polish  secret service as he takes a week-long guided trip round various sites related to the German occupation of Poland, including a trip to the notorious SS-run camp Treblinka, where more than 800,000 Jews died between 1942 and 1943.    The £1,500-a-head tour, organised by Irving’s Focal Point Publications website, will also visit Heinrich Himmler’s bunker in Hochward as well as Adolf Hitler’s Wolf’s Lair headquarters in Ketrzyn, as well as a series of lectures, and screening of the German film Downfall, about the last days of Hitler, featuring commentary by Irving.   A spokesman for the Polish Embassy in London said they were aware of the visit and it will be “under strict observation by the Polish authorities”.  Linda Paterson, chief executive of Yad Vashem UK, the Holocaust remembrance group, said Irving's presence at the concentration camps was "totally inappropriate and confrontational".  One Polish war survivor said: “Our people suffered very cruelly under the Nazis and this man should never be allowed in the country.”  Irving was jailed in 2006 in Austria under the 1945 Prohibition of Reactivation law, a Stalin-era law against reviving the Nazi party.   Sigh. I saw a video clip of Irving denouncing the Polish government for Disneyfication of the death camps but who is he to criticize anything having to do with them? His position on the nature of the camps has changed so many times over the years that I don't know what it is right now. Sometimes, Irving concedes that the Shoah occurred but without Hitler's knowledge. Other times, Irving claims that people weren't gassed and that the numbers of the dead have been greatly exaggerated. He's such a loathsome toad of a man that I do not care what his current position is. So, will his tour consist of pointing out where things did not happen? All I know is that it's obscene for David Irving to make a farthing as a "tour guide." Fuck you, Mr. Irving. I hope your "tour" loses money and exposes you to the ridicule you deserve. Fuck you, for even making me think of you and your egregiously evil malakatude.

Posted by: Ninette |  September 17, 2010 at 12:32    Denial is his default position. To Irving, Hitler was just another over-ambitious pol who failed.    Posted by:  Adrastos |  September 17, 2010 at 12:44    Going to the saying that, if nothing else, a person could always serve as a bad example.. Irving is a model on how folks can believe O'Donnel, etc.   Posted by: MapleStreet |  September 17, 2010 at 15:26    Excellent point, Maple. Irving, however, is well-credentialed liar.   Posted by:  Adrastos |  September 17, 2010 at 15:53    Do you suppose the Polish authorities would issue me a temporary vendor's permit so that I could set up a rotten-egg-and-fruit concession on the day of Irving's visit? I'm sure I could make a lot of money...   Posted by: Interrobang |  September 17, 2010 at 19:44    What a luverly idea, Interro. Bang on...   Posted by:  Adrastos |  September 17, 2010 at 21:29    See, this is my whole point in criticizing post-modern relativism. In areas where personal opinion is valid, like whether you love or hate Brett Favre in the NFL, everyone's entitled to their own opinion. But propagandists and corporate media have co-opted subjective reality and applied it universally to the objective world. Now, no matter what the level of dumb-assed fucktardery, whether it's this shit-for-brains Holocaust denier, idiotic moon-landing hoaxers, or supply-side economists, opinions are accepted as a valid perception of reality. If we lived in a world based on the proper affirmation of objective reality, these people would be universally branded as kooks, cranks, morons, idiots and lunatics and put into psychotherapy instead of on "Meet the Press." Jeebus!

Posted by:  Marco |  September 20, 2010 at 15:04    That's an uplifting thought, Marco. He could, however, come back as a cockroach. No strike that, he *is* a cockroach.
