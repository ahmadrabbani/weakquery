Author of controversial works such as  Hitler�s War and  The Destruction of Dresden , Irving is a non-academic  self-taught  historian who from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s was a leading  British author on  World War II . In the mid-1980s he started openly associating with  Neo-Nazi and extremist groups, and his reputation began to wane. In the late 1990s he sued the prominent Holocaust historian  Deborah Lipstadt for listing him as a  Holocaust denier in her book  Denying the Holocaust ; after a much publicized trial Irving lost and was found to be a Holocaust denier by the court. Among the Holocaust deniers, Irving is perhaps the only one who for some time managed to keep up the reputation of a serious, if controversial, historian. Irving is considered an icon to many in the Holocaust denial camp, but after the Lipstadt trial verdict he has fought an increasingly lonely battle. He has since been barred from entering many countries.    1 Early life Born in  Essex ,  England , his father John James Cawdell Irving was a  Commander in the  Royal Navy , his mother Beryl an illustrator. During the  Second World War his father was an officer aboard the Light Cruiser  HMS Edinburgh  Six ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS Edinburgh for the Scottish city of Edinburgh.

Irving�s father survived, but after the incident cut off all ties with his wife and their children.  Irving first gained his notoriety as a student of the  Imperial College London  Introduction Imperial College London is a college of the University of London which focuses on science and technology, and is located in South Kensington in London. Imperial College London is the new official name of what used to be called Imperial Colleg , where he wrote for the student newspaper and served as the editor of the London University Carnival Committee�s journal,  Carnival Times . Here Irving made allegations such as "the national press is owned by Jews", and contributed to a variety of extremist features, including  racist cartoons, a defense of South African  apartheid  Apartheid ap-ar-taed is an Afrikaans word meaning "separation" or literally "aparthood" (or "apartness").

The term Nazi is a short form of the German  [1] ; as a result Irving was removed from his editorial duties.   2 "The Destruction of Dresden" Irving soon dropped out of college and went to  Germany where he worked in a Thyssen steel works in the  Ruhr and learned  German . He then left Germany and moved to Franco's Spain where he worked as a clerk at an airbase near  Madrid . Establishing contacts with Europe�s far-right, in  1962 he wrote a series of thirty-seven articles on the Allied bombing war,  Wie Deutschlands St�dte Starben , for the German right-wing journal  Neue Illustrierte . These served as the basis for his first book  The Destruction of Dresden , published in  1963 . In it he examined the Allied  bombing of Dresden during the final months of World War II. By the  1960s , a debate about the morality of the  carpet bombing of German cities and civilian population had already begun, especially in the UK. Hence, the public was receptive to Irving's persuasively written book, illustrated with graphic pictures. The book became an international bestseller.  In the first edition of the book Irving's figures for deaths in  Dresden (which he initially reported as estimated authoritatively at 135,000, and which he himself estimated at between 100,000 and 250,000) were an order of magnitude higher than anyone else's. Nonetheless, these figures became widely accepted and were repeated in many standard references and encyclopedias. Over the next three decades later editions of the book gradually modified that figure downwards to a range of 50,000-100,000, but during that time Irving also made a number of public statements indicating that 100,000 or more Germans had been killed. It was not until the hearing of Irving's libel suit against  Deborah Lipstadt in  2000 that the figures were discredited. Today, the  Dresden bombing casualty figures are estimated at about 40,000 dead.  Politics Business Finance       Topics: David Irving War Book Holocaust Hitler Historian Dresden German...
