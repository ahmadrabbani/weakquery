 THHP Questions: David Irving

                    David Irving Question: I realize that david irving is an idiot, but I would like to know if there is a bibliography of his works so I can avoid them in my research. I would appreciate any information on his writings or where I can get the information without having to go to his site. To deny the holocaust--gas chambers is to deny the anti-semitism that allowed it to occur, and it opens the door for other genocides in the future. We must learn from the past or be condemned to repeat--an old adage used to the point of cliche, but that doesn't lessen its truth.   Andrew Mathis responds: You can find a nearly complete listing of Irving's books here:  http://catalog.loc.gov/  This list does not include his  Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich , which, I believe, is his most recent work but was self- published.  You should be aware that Irving's earlier works, for instance,  The Destruction of Dresden , while clearly biased, are not works of Holocaust denial. Irving claims to have been "converted" to "revisionism" in the late '80s, long after  Dresden was completed. Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., a survivor of the Dresden bombing who wrote  Slaughterhouse-Five on the experience, actually cites Irving's  Dresden in the book.  Andrew E.
