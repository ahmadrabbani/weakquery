       The Official Website of Representative David Duke, PhD  12/20/2006 David Irving Released from Prison in Austria  Posted under: General   — @ 8:58 am          David Irving Finally FREE!   David Duke’s comments: I think it is the first great result of the Holocaust Conference. In a number of interviews on prominent media I constantly shamed the media all over Europe by protesting David Irving’s imprisonment. This may be the first concrete benefit of the Holocaust Conference: a great historian has finally been freed. Jailing men and women for questioning aspects of the Holocaust is an issue finally brought to the fore! Here is one of many media articles sent to Davidduke.com from Europe.  Historian David Irving has been freed from prison in Austria after serving 13 months of a three-year sentence for Holocaust denial. Court observers in Austria believe that the early release was at least partially a result of publicity of the recent Holocaust Conference in Iran that focused attention on his an other scholars imprisonment in European nations. The imprisonment of Irving, as well as Ernst Zundel and Gemar Rudolf in Germany is becoming an increasing source of embarrassment in a Europe where political leaders often criticize Muslim nations for lack of free speech. In a number of worldwide interviews from Tehran, the controversial former member of the House of Representatives and former KKK member David Duke focused on Irving’s imprisonment on interviews widely aired in Austria and around Europe. Irving, who was arrested when he visited the country for a speaking engagement last year, was told by a court in Vienna today that he would serve the rest of his sentence on probation. The court had heard arguments from the defence, calling for the sentence to be reduced, and from prosecutors who were demanding a tougher sentence.   Irving told reporters outside the court that he was “fit and well”. He was detained under Austria’s strict legislation against denying the Holocaust under an arrest warrant dating back to 1989. It concerned two speeches he made in the country 17 years ago, during which prosecutors say he claimed that there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz and that Hitler had protected Jews. Deborah Lipstadt, the American academic who successfully defended a libel case against Irving in 2000 after she branded him a Shoah denier, has said she disagreed with the sentence. Irving claimed at the time of the libel action that he had not denied the Holocaust but had questioned the number of Jews killed and denied that they were systematically exterminated.       0.081 || Powered by   Duke site                  Search this Site:      Subscribe!
