An Earlier Article on the "Israeli David Irving Suit" (2003)</h2>
		<div class="blogPost">
          <div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/3141">http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/3141</a><p> Opinion<p>The David Irving Trial in Israel<p><br>The Israeli &#39;David Irving&#39; is himself an Israeli and a Jew. Moreover,<br>while David Irving was never on the faculty of a bona fide academic<br>institution, the plaintiff in the Israeli David Irving Trial is. He is<br>Dr. Neve Gordon, from the Department of Political Science at<br>Ben-Gurion University.<br>From Richard Lakisher<p><br>In the now world-famous libel suit between Holocaust Denier David<br>Irving and Dr. Deoborah Lipstadt, Irving sued Lipstadt and her<br>publisher. Lipstadt had written that Irving was a Nazi apologist and<br>admirer of Hitler. She had asserted that Irving was a Holocaust Denier<br>who had distorted facts and manipulated documents to prove that there<br>had been no genocide of Jews during World War II. Irving sued for<br>libel. He claimed that Lipstadt damaged his reputation and credentials<br>as a serious historian and writer. Lipstadt&#39;s claims against Irving<br>were in part based on Irving&#39;s own efforts as apologist for and<br>promoter of the writings and views of the neo-Nazi and Holocaust<br>Denier Ernst Zundel, who was on trial at the time in Canada.<p>Dr. Lipstadt&#39;s defense was that her depiction of Irving as a Nazi and<br>Holocaust Denier was entirely true and backed up by numerous writings<br>by Irving himself. She presented evidence in court that Irving is a<br>racist, an extremist anti-Semite himself, and associated with<br>anti-Semitic right-wing extremists.<p>The judgment in the case was handed down in April, 2000. The court<br>found for the defendants (meaning Lipstadt). The British court found<br>that her assertions were simply statements of fact. The judge<br>confirmed that Irving had served as an apologist for neo-Nazis and<br>anti-Semites, and rejected his denials that he is an extremist, racist<br>and anti-Semite. (It continues to be a fact that he regularly appears<br>before and writes for anti-Semitic audiences.) The court ordered<br>Irving to pay 150,000 pounds sterling in damages for his baseless suit<br>against Lipstadt. The judgment and the legal costs are estimated by<br>The Guardian to have cost Irving between one and two million pounds<br>and to have forced him into bankruptcy.<p>The British court said effectively that it is not libelous to tell the<br>truth about a fanatic extremist. It is not libelous to denounce him in<br>strong terms. Extremists may not use the court as a club to stifle<br>denunciations of their behavior and writings by those who are<br>vehemently critical of their views.<p>It is one of the bizarre twists of the political scene in Israel that<br>a David Irving Trial of sorts is taking place there at the moment. It<br>is a trial that bears many similarities to the actual David Irving<br>Trial in Britain.<p>To begin with, it involves a political extremist suing for libel, and<br>a courageous critic who labeled him an anti-Semite and fanatic because<br>of his writings and political behavior. The Israeli plaintiff is<br>himself a writer who has often been cited and featured with honor on<br>the personal web site of the British David Irving. His writings have<br>been published on neo-Nazi and Holocaust Denier web sites, as well as<br>in other anti-Semitic and Islamist fundamentalist journals and web<br>sites.<p>The defendant argues that the plaintiff is attempting to use the court<br>as a club to suppress free speech in an anti-democratic manner. The<br>plaintiff has filed a frivolous nuisance suit to bully his critics, so<br>that they will be afraid to denounce the plaintiff&#39;s political views<br>and behavior.<p>There are other significant similarities between the two trials. In<br>both, the plaintiff has a record of praising and promoting the views<br>of people commonly seen as Holocaust Deniers. In both instances, the<br>plaintiff associates with extremist anti-Semitic organizations and<br>with individuals widely considered to be anti-Semites, and<br>collaborates with them in publishing their views. Both plaintiffs are<br>venomously critical of Israel and its leaders and have expressed<br>&quot;understanding&quot; for anti-Israel terrorism. In both cases, the<br>extremist plaintiff claims that his good name as a researcher was<br>damaged by those who attack his behavior and denounce his writings and<br>opinions. In both cases, no attempt was made to prove that actual<br>material damages were suffered by the plaintiff.<p>In short, both plaintiffs in the two David Irving Trials used the<br>framework of a libel suit to try to force their critics into silence.<p>There is one important difference though. The Israeli &#39;David Irving&#39;<br>is himself an Israeli and a Jew. Moreover, while David Irving was<br>never on the faculty of a bona fide academic institution, the<br>plaintiff in the Israeli David Irving Trial is. He is Dr. Neve Gordon,<br>from the Department of Political Science at Ben-Gurion University.<p>The defendant in Gordon&#39;s libel suit is the professor, columnist and<br>writer, Professor Steven Plaut. He is on the faculty of the University<br>of Haifa.<p>Neve Gordon is a member of a department that is nearly wall-to-wall<br>leftist. He holds a Ph.D. from Notre Dame University, a Catholic<br>school in Indiana. Most of the articles he has published are<br>politicized and/or devoted to attacking Israeli policies and/or<br>denounce Israel as a terrorist country. The Middle East Quarterly has<br>declared him to be one of Israel&#39;s academic extremists.<p>Gordon goes beyond the chic support for the PLO and its positions so<br>common today among Israeli academic leftists. Gordon has allied<br>himself and collaborated with a wide variety of anti-Semites and<br>anti-Semitic organizations. He used to lead the Physicians for Human<br>Rights in Israel (despite not being an MD himself), a pro-Arab<br>organization so extreme that it has been publicly denounced by the<br>Israel Medical Association. It was condemned as an openly anti-Semitic<br>organization by Professor Gerald Steinberg of Bar Ilan University,<br>who, together with 200 other people, signed a petition to that effect.<p>Gordon also maintains a long-term ongoing collaboration with Alexander<br>Cockburn, the anti-Israel Far Leftist American columnist and publisher<br>of Counterpunch magazine. Cockburn has been repeatedly denounced as an<br>anti-Semite by the New Republic and by a variety of other journals,<br>organizations and columnists, including the Seattle Times, the<br>Declaration Foundation, Professor Edward Alexander, LewRockwell.com,<br>LeftWatch, and Christian Action for Israel. Cockburn has openly given<br>credence to reports that Jews spread anthrax in the US and that Israel<br>was part of a conspiracy to topple the World Trade Center. Cockburn<br>insists Jews conspire to control the media. Gordon has published a<br>large number of articles attacking Israel in Counterpunch.<p>Gordon is active in a Far-Left Israeli organization with the Arabic<br>name Taayush, which, in Gordon&#39;s own words (cited in an interview), is<br>a seditious organization that &quot;opposes Arab-Jewish coexistence.&quot;<p>But Gordon&#39;s screeds appeal to an audience that goes beyond the mere<br>vocal critics of Israel. Gordon&#39;s articles have been published and<br>cited on a wide variety of neo-Nazi, Holocaust Denial and Islamist<br>fundamentalist newspapers and web sites. On several neo-Nazi web<br>sites, a work by Gordon is cited right after a citation from Hitler<br>himself, making for curious footnote bedfellows.<p>Gordon has published articles attacking Israel in the Egyptian<br>anti-Semitic daily Al-Ahram, which routinely spreads anti-Jewish blood<br>libels. Gordon&#39;s articles have been published by al-Jazeera, the same<br>Arab news agency that airs the speeches of Bin Laden and that<br>broadcasted the shots of the Allied troops being murdered by Saddam&#39;s<br>Republican Guards during the recent Iraq war.<p>The Holocaust-denying Radio Islam internet web site carries the<br>writings of Gordon alongside its reprinting of The Protocols of the<br>Elders of Zion. Radio Islam also indulges in traditional medieval<br>anti-Jewish blood libels, and Der Sturmer-like cartoons showing Jews<br>drinking blood. Gordon&#39;s articles have been published on the<br>Electronic Intifada, a pro-terror web site, and on the web site of the<br>anti-Jewish, Islamist, pro-Hamas CAIR organization in the US.<p>While Gordon claims that he himself did not place his articles on some<br>of these more anti-Semitic web sites, the fact that the articles<br>appealed to the operators of those sites sufficiently for them to<br>carry them speaks volumes about their contents.<p>In his writings, Gordon repeatedly insists Israel is a fascist state<br>and a terrorist state, engaging in state terrorism that is no<br>different morally from the mass atrocities of Palestinian and other<br>terrorists. He has denounced Israeli fascism not only in English, but<br>also on web sites in German and Italian. Not only has he denounced<br>Ariel Sharon and Benjamin Netanyahu as war criminals, he has attacked<br>leftist Labor Party ultra-Oslo-dove Ehud Barak. Gordon has written<br>that Bibi Netanyahu is the continuation of Yigal Amir, the murderer of<br>Yitzhak Rabin, and is a spy, criminal or terrorist. He insists Sharon<br>delights in the deaths of Arabs and Jews. He was one of the signers of<br>the petitions before the recent Iraq war declaring that Israel was<br>planning to perpetrate atrocities and massive crimes against humanity<br>once the war broke out. Ben-Dror Yemini, a columnist at Maariv, has<br>denounced all such signatories as being the Israeli equivalents of<br>Lord Haw-Haw, the British traitor and lackey of Hitler during World<br>War II.<p>Gordon repeatedly endorses insubordination and mutiny by Israelis<br>refusing to serve in the military and is active in political groups<br>supporting the mutineers. He has compared Israel to apartheid South<br>Africa and has called the Zionist Organization of America in the<br>United States racist. Gordon has repeatedly endorsed general boycotts<br>against Israel and his articles are carried by pro-boycott web sites,<br>magazines and organizations. He has expressed sympathy for the<br>bi-national state solution, in which Israel would cease to exist as a<br>Jewish state. He has expressed understanding for terrorism because it<br>is caused by injustice. He has repeatedly insisted that Israel - and<br>specifically Prime Minister Ehud Barak - only understands violence,<br>implying that Arabs should engage in more of it. He considers Israel<br>the main culprit responsible for Middle East violence, and insists<br>this was so even when Barak was prime minister.<p>Gordon&#39;s politics are so extremist that one of the professors at Notre<br>Dame, where Gordon got his Ph.D. has denounced him venomously in<br>writing and wished him to be blown up by terrorists in an Israeli<br>mall.<p>Gordon has been active among those Israeli and international Leftists<br>seeking to interfere with Israeli military operations against<br>Palestinian terrorists in the territories. He has worked with Taayush<br>and the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) in trying to prevent<br>Israeli actions against terrorism there, and - according to his own<br>admission - he was arrested for this at least once.<p>After the Netanya Passover Massacre of 2002, Israel launched Operation<br>Defensive Wall against the terrorists. During that operation, Gordon<br>was one of the group of Far Leftists who illegally infiltrated Israeli<br>army lines and entered Arafat&#39;s besieged headquarters in Ramallah to<br>prevent Israel from arresting the wanted terrorists holed up there,<br>and trying to block IDF attempts to attack Arafat&#39;s offices. On<br>February 2, 2002, Israel&#39;s Haaretz daily carried a large photo of<br>Gordon in a warm embrace with Arafat in his besieged Ramallah<br>headquarters, clasping hands together in a heart-warming show of<br>solidarity. These hands of Arafat being clasped with affection by<br>Gordon were the very same that signed the orders for the murders of<br>hundreds of Israelis. No photo of Gordon showing solidarity with the<br>victims of Arafat&#39;s terror was ever printed in the paper.<p>The most dramatic manifestation of Gordon&#39;s political extremism is his<br>promotion and praise of the scribblings of Norman Finkelstein.<br>Finkelstein is by now fairly well know for his book The Holocaust<br>Industry, and other writings, in which he trivializes and mocks the<br>Holocaust and claims that virtually all Holocaust survivors are liars,<br>thieves and cheats. Finkelstein has been denounced as a Holocaust<br>Denier, neo-Nazi, Holocaust trivializer, anti-Semite, fraud,<br>pseudo-researcher, and worse by nearly every reviewer in every<br>legitimate medium that has discussed him and his book. He was fired<br>from jobs at two New York area academic institutions and now is<br>employed by a Catholic college in Chicago. The New York Times has<br>compared Finkelstein&#39;s book to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.<br>The British Guardian claims Finkelstein is an anti-Semite and a<br>Holocaust Denier. The Washington Post declares Finkelstein an<br>anti-Semite with ties to Nazis. Moment magazine, the ADL, the World<br>Jewish Congress, Elie Wiesel, Professor Edward Alexander, Alan<br>Dershowitz, the Canadian Jewish News, the web site on anti-Semitism at<br>the University of Tel Aviv, Dennis Prager, the Jerusalem Report, Jonah<br>Daniel Goldhagen and many others have denounced Finkelstein as a Nazi,<br>Holocaust Denier, fraud, and/or anti-Semite.<p>Finkelstein is also on record endorsing Arab terror and the<br>destruction of Israel. Finkelstein has become the featured hero of<br>virtually every Holocaust Denial and neo-Nazi web site on earth. He is<br>the Nazi&#39;s pet Jewish historian, whose research proves there was never<br>any Holocaust of Jews by the Germans at all. The neo-Nazis insist his<br>writings prove that talk about a Holocaust is all a Zionist hoax. As<br>it turns out, Neve Gordon from Ben-Gurion University has published<br>articles in the leftist magazine The Nation, in Israel&#39;s Haaretz, and<br>on several web sites that not only sing Finkelstein&#39;s praises and<br>endorse many of the themes in Finkelstein&#39;s books, but has actually<br>compared Finkelstein favorably to the Prophets of the Bible.<br>Finkelstein himself is so proud of Gordon&#39;s praise that he features<br>one of Gordon&#39;s articles on his own personal web site. Gordon may in<br>fact be the only academic at a bona fide university in the world who<br>acknowledges Finkelstein as a serious researcher.<p>All of which brings us to Gordon&#39;s libel suit against Professor Plaut.<br>On various occasions, Plaut has criticized Gordon&#39;s political opinions<br>and political behavior on the internet. Gordon regards such criticism<br>of himself as libel. In rather typical leftist manner, Gordon seems to<br>believe that the most extremist, fanatic and outrageous behavior and<br>opinions of leftists must be protected as free speech, but criticism<br>by non-leftists must be suppressed, using the courts and lawyers as an<br>anti-democratic billy club. Leftists in many countries use the filing<br>of frivolous nuisance libel suits as a guerilla tactic to suppress the<br>free speech of their critics.<p>Gordon&#39;s libel suit against Professor Plaut is based mainly on two<br>short sets of comments that Plaut wrote on the internet about Gordon<br>and his friends. In one, Plaut described Gordon as a groupie of<br>Holocaust Denier Norman Finkelstein. In Gordon&#39;s suit, he<br>intentionally mistranslates this into Hebrew as if Plaut were saying<br>that Gordon is ?walking in the furrow? of Holocaust Deniers. The fact<br>that Gordon describes Norman Finkelstein as the moral equivalent of<br>Biblical Prophets would seem to make his describing Gordon as a<br>groupie of Finkelstein factually unchallengeable.<p>The other comment of Professor Plaut&#39;s that upset Gordon was in an<br>internet posting reporting the actions of the human shields entering<br>Arafat&#39;s headquarters to defend wanted Palestinian terrorists during<br>Operation Defensive Shield. Plaut reported that Gordon himself had<br>entered the headquarters with these people and was thus to be found<br>among the Judenrat wanna-bes. Describing people who appoint themselves<br>as representatives and liaisons to mass murderers of Jews might<br>legitimately be described as Judenrat wanna-bes. But Gordon and his<br>Arab lawyer from East Jerusalem insist it is libelous.<p>Plaut also described Gordon as a fanatic anti-Semite because of his<br>endorsements of Finkelstein&#39;s ideas and writings. In any case, if<br>proof were needed that this is so, a very large host of anti-Jewish,<br>neo-Nazi and Holocaust-Denial web sites and newspapers regard Gordon<br>as sufficiently anti-Semitic to publish his writings.<p>In short, Gordon has decided that Plaut will play the role of Deborah<br>Lipstadt in Israel&#39;s analogue to the David Irving Trial. Everything<br>Plaut has written about Gordon is simply an assessment of Gordon&#39;s own<br>political writings and behavior. Gordon is a public figure - an Op-Ed<br>columnist, a representative of several radical political<br>organizations, a very public hand-holder of Yasser Arafat - and<br>criticism of his political opinions and political actions is a<br>legitimate expression of free speech. Plaut&#39;s criticisms and<br>denunciations of Gordon&#39;s behavior and writings were evoked by<br>Gordon&#39;s own political behavior, exactly as were Deborah Lipstadt&#39;s<br>denunciations of David Irving. Actually, Plaut has never met Gordon<br>and knew nothing about him before the suit, other than from his<br>political writings and actions.<p>Free speech in Israel is under assault and the defeat of frivolous<br>libel suits is a crucial part of its protection.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><br />
