 Austria's highest court rejects appeal in David Irving trial

 Austria's highest court rejects appeal in David Irving trial From : BernardZ < DontBother@xxxxxxxxxx > Date : Tue, 5 Sep 2006 07:37:02 +1000  I actually thought that David Irving would win but he lost his case in  the Austrian Supreme Court. It will be interesting to see how his next case goes on his claim that  "Kristallnacht was not the Nazis but of others who had dressed up as  stormtroopers." < http://wapurl.co.uk/?4VGV8IR > Austria's Supreme Court has rejected an appeal by right-wing British  historian David Irving and upheld the conviction in his Holocaust denial  case, the Austria Press Agency reported Monday. Interestingly he stated  "I made a mistake when I said there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz,"  Irving testified, at one point expressing sorrow "for all the innocent  people who died during the Second World War." --  The people that believe that the world is flat are proof that heaps of  time, huge amounts of scientific evidence, plenty of eyewitness  accounts, numerous experts opinion and mountains of photographs are not  enough to convince some people! What is particularly frustrating is  that there are many such people on the Usenet. Observations of Bernard - No 104 .
