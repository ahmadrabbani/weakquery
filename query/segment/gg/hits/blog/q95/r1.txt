 David Irving Archive

  AUTHOR ARCHIVE     David Irving     "IN THE WORDS of the military writer John Keegan: 'No historian of the Second World War can afford to ignore Irving.' Few contemporary scholars of the Third Reich have his depth of knowledge, virtually none has met as many of its leading figures and nobody, surely, has unearthed more original material--a private archive known as the 'Irving Collection,' always generously made available to other researchers, which weighs more than half a ton."   Robert Harris, London Evening Standard , April 1, 1996.
