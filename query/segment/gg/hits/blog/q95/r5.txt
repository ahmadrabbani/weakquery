Guth, PH.D., Professor of Law and Director of the Canadian Legal History Project, University of Manitoba "... a stunning expose of what Hitler knew and Irving must know about German governmental genocide."  Rabbi W. Gunther Plaut, Senior Scholar, Holy Blossom Temple, Toronto "Eberhard Jackel's article is an important contribution in the ongoing battle against Holocaust deniers. It deserves the widest possible distribution."  Book Description Among the dangers facing the Jewish people today is the concerted effort of so-called historical revisionists to deny the reality of the Holocaust. Among the most dangerous of the "revisionists" is David Irving who, with the trappings of the respectable historian--research and sources--has become the darling of neo-Nazi activists. Eberhard Jckel, Professor of History at the University of Stuttgart, has answered Irving's falsehoods. This book has been build around a translation of Dr. Jackel's work.
