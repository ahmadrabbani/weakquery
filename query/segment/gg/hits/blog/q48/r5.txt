Fashion writers Holly Thomas and Janet Bennett Kelly led an  Oscars post-mortem chat covering all your fashion questions. Here is a selection:  Question: Anne Hathaway's Late-in-the-Show Red Dress was hands-down my favorite of the evening. I only wish she had worn it longer - such a good color for her and extremely flattering. I was surprised that red seemed to be the color of the evening, which I was happy to see - what do you think about any color trends?   Answer : I'm torn between the gorgeous red Versace dress you loved and the creamy Givenchy she wore to open the show as my favorite. I'm not torn, however, on the Vivienne Westwood ballgown with the mismatched necklace and crazy prima ballerina hair.  Liz Kelly also  reviewed the best and worst dressed at the Academy Awards:  This year's Oscar ceremony was underwhelming in myriad respects. One of them was fashion. This year's crop of gowns failed to produce even one buzzy fashion trend. And wiith considerably less bling on the red carpet, 2011 may just go down in history as the year that Oscar fashion was a bit of a yawn. Still, there were some standouts -- both stunners and stinkers -- worth a second look.   The insouciant Gwyneth Paltrow in utterly stunning Calvin Klein (which totally made up for her off-key on-stage performance), host Anne Hathaway's red carpet look: a dress from the Valentino archives (though we loved her in most of her gazillion on-stage gown changes, too), Helen Miren in drop-dead gorgeous grey Vivienne Westwood and a slimmed down Jennifer Hudson in Versace.   After the event the famed post-Oscar parties begin, and Dan Zak and Amy Argetsinger gave us an  inside look at one of these events, the Vanity Fair Oscar party:  Think "Inception," but more bewildering. It's a madhouse, a funhouse of mirrors and topiary, a wax museum come to life, a half-dozen tax brackets and Zip codes away from a really good frat party, where the drinking game is How Many Flutes of Moet Does It Take To Work up the Nerve to Pet Donald Trump's Hair?  Answer: 1.5. (It feels like corn silk.)  Another question: How does one pass the hours between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. at Vanity Fair when one doesn't have a director to corner, or a starlet to seduce, or a powder to snort? One does what most everyone else does: play the world's most opulent, expensive game of musical chairs. Turn and pose and sit here, in the glow of George Hamilton's tan. Turn and pose and sit there, in the shamrock-green shadow of Gayle King's gown (just in case Oprah shows). Someone bid $80,000 at Elton John's party for two tickets to this one. The cost of a top-tier college education - for what? To get elbowed in the ribs by the most skilled crowd-parter in the world: Serena Williams, whose backhand is crippling in a roomful of people who ignore every "Pardon me."
