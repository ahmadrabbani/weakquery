 Booties, Bags and Baubles: Oscar Fashion Round-Up

As much as I love Anne Hathaway and James Franco, the show was a giant snooze! The Oscar broadcast is usually not the most exciting in general, but something was really lacking this year. Maybe it was the lack of production numbers Or the fact that James Franco looked like I had no idea what he was doing up there? Either way, I found it hard to get through.  On the the fashion note, I think there were some hits and some misses. I don't think that "Hollywood Glamour" you expect from the Oscar red carpet was really brought this year, although nobody really looked terrible. My biggest disappointment was the lack of jewelry. No statement necklaces, small little earrings and just a bangle or two was pretty much it. So sad for a jewelry lover like me!  Okay, so on to my picks. Pastel's ruled the carpet (do we spot a trend for Spring?) and we are absolutely loving them!  1) Mila Kunis in Elie Saab    Congrats Mila! You made it on my favorite looks list for each award show this season and definitely are my #1 pick for Oscars Best Dressed!! Mila literally rocked out award season and there literally isn't a look I wouldn't wear that she sported this season. This Elie Saab gown is no exception. I still literally can't get over how sexy yet feminine the lavender lace and chiffon gown is! Her dainty Neil Lane diamond and platinum earrings, bangle and cocktail ring gave made it ultra feminine. The nude python clutch gave it a modern edge. She is young after all!  2) Hailee Steinfeld in Marchesa   Hailee is one to watch! While I am personally campaigning for her to be named the rough around the edges Katniss Everdeen in the forthcoming Hunger Games movie, I can't deny her absolute glamour and poise throughout all of award season! Her custom Marchesa creation (she actually helped design it) is perfectly age appropriate and just ethereal and gorgeous. She looks like the perfect little ballerina princess doesn't she? The adorable headband and topknot hairdo work perfectly with the ultra femme blush-colored dress. A heart shaped Fred Leighton ring and silver clutch with bow detailing make it young and fun!  3. Mandy Moore in Monique Lhullier   Our third pick, Mandy Moore, is quite a surprise because I really don't ever like her looks on the red carpet! I was pleasantly surprised with her Globes look and even more excited about her Oscars look! This nude and embellished Monique Lhullier gown has a vintage vibe (reminds me of something a glam Betty Draper would wear) and is really quite feminine and flirty. I am a sucker for the embellishments. The dress is almost an optical illusion (doesn't the top almost look painted on?) but it works! Oversized 10-carat Chopard pave diamond earrings and orange-red lips give this look a 1960s vibe thats just perf!  My honorable mentions, Halle Berry and Natalie Portman , also looked gorgeous. But I want to know - who had your favorite look?
