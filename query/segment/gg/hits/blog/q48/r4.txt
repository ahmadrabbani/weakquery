 Oscar Red-Carpet Fashion: Natalie Portman, Hailee Steinfeld Shine - MTV Movie News| MTV 

        Feb 27 2011 9:17 PM EST  43,225  Oscar Red-Carpet Fashion: Natalie Portman, Hailee Steinfeld Shine Fiery reds and deep purples rule the Academy Awards red carpet. By Jocelyn Vena (@jocelyn1212)          The only dress code for the  Oscars is glamour, and this year's red carpet certainly brought the dazzle. With lace and va va voom ruling the night, two celebrities in particular are guaranteed to have fashionistas buzzing around the water cooler on Monday morning. "Black Swan" star  Natalie Portman and "True Grit" actress  Hailee Steinfeld pumped up the glam on the carpet.    For photos of all the stars on the Oscar red carpet, click here.    Oscar nominee  Portman (and her ever-expanding baby bump) hit the carpet in a deep-purple off-the-shoulder billowy silk chiffon gown with sequin detailing by "Black Swan" costumers Rodarte. She completed the look with tassel earrings by Tiffany & Co.  Purple was a hot color on the carpet, with Portman's "Black Swan" co-star  Mila Kunis dazzling in a lavender lace and silk organza gown by Elie Saab Haute Couture from the designer's spring 2011 collection.  Amy Adams also rocked a purple shade, wearing a deep-violet, sparkly cap sleeve dress by L'Wren Scott, accessorized with an emerald drop necklace.  Cate Blanchett looked like a warrior in a structured lavender gown with cut-out detailing by Givenchy Couture.  Scarlett Johansson looked chic and relaxed rocking wavy hair and a see-through purple lace Dolce & Gabbana gown that was made even sexier thanks to the cut-out back.  Red was the other big color of the night. Oscar host  Anne Hathaway hit the carpet in a strapless red ruffled gown with a large bustle. "Winter's Bone" star and first-time nominee  Jennifer Lawrence stunned on the carpet in a body-hugging, minimalist red dress by Calvin Klein Collection.  Oscar winner  Sandra Bullock was sophisticated in her strapless red Vera Wang dress. And she may have just had a baby, but  Penélope Cruz looked nothing less than "wow" in a red, beaded showstopper gown by L'Wren Scott.  Jennifer Hudson also jumped on the red-hued bandwagon, looking svelte in a low-cut halter gown in orangey-red by Versace.  While color definitely ruled the carpet, not all of the stars went that route.  Mandy Moore sparkled in a nude-color, off-the-shoulder dress by Monique Lhuillier, and  Halle Berry looked ethereal in a feathery gown in a similar shade.  Michelle Williams was still rocking the blond pixie cut, but this time she sparkled in a skintight nude-color cap-sleeve gown by Chanel.  Also opting for the pale trend was the Oscar nominee who'll have everyone talking: 14-year-old  Steinfeld , who opted for an age-appropriate, blush colored 3/4-length ballerina-esque tutu dress with a large tulle skirt by Marchesa; that starlet worked with the designers to design the look.
