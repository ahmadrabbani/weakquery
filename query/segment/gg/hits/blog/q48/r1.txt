In an emotional evening that saw Winfrey wiping away tears and leaning heavily on longtime partner Stedman Graham, the former talk show host accepted the  Academy of Motion Picture's Arts & Science's Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award , given periodically for philanthropic efforts.  "I never imagined receiving an Oscar, especially for doing what is part of my calling, part of my being," said  Winfrey , 57, who gave an Oscar-nominated performance in 1985's  The Color Purple and was a producer on the films  Beloved and  Precious .  "If you are not a former colored girl born in Mississippi in 1954," she said, "it is impossible for you to know what this journey has meant."

Originally posted  07/08/2011 04:15PM  She bid her  talk show farewell in May, and ever since,  Oprah Winfrey 's loyal fans and followers have kept their eyes on their idol, waiting for her next move.  But, despite reports Friday, one thing seems for sure: Although Winfrey, 57, who now  calls the OWN network home, is known  for going big , she won't be honoring the biggest stars from the big screen this year.  Sources at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences say that Winfrey is not in talks to host the 84th annual Oscar ceremony in February.  "The camera loves Oprah. Oprah's a genius," Academy president Tom Sherak tells   The Hollywood Reporter  . "But it's not true, and I don't know where that story even came from."

"They were outside near the restroom having a discussion," a guest at the  Vanity Fair bash tells PEOPLE. "It seemed a bit more serious – it certainly wasn't a 'Hi, how are you?' talk."  The musician, 21, and the actor, 30,  started dating last fall but  broke up in December.

But  Selena Gomez and  Justin Bieber let actions speak louder than words (again) Sunday night when they turned up together at  Vanity Fair 's post-Oscars bash.  Gomez, in a red Grecian gown by Dolce & Gabbana, and Bieber, in a black tux – with a red pocket square to match his date – looked every bit the comfortable couple as they posed with their arms around each other before the party, held at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood.

And we're not just talking about the honor of being nominated.  According to the  New York Post  , Distinctive Assets has created a consolation gift bag, which will be distributed on Monday morning to the nominees who didn't win.  Its contents? Some pretty fantastic – and exotic – loot worth, in total, more than $23,000.   PHOTOS: Party Time! Stars Celebrate Oscar  Virgin Galatic has provided an orbital space flight, according to the report, while the Huvafen Fushi resort has included a vacation at an underwater spa in the Maldives (furnished by Premier Tours) valued at $16,000.  Also in the gift bag: a pack of Swarovski-bedazzled electronic cigarettes ($100), a fitness retreat from Live in Fitness ($4,800), and some black caviar eye and neck cream from J. Holly International ($200), as well as the use of a private island for five days, complete with a private "houseman," from APrivateIsland.com ($12,000).

Decamping to the Governors Ball within the Hollywood and Highland complex immediately after Sunday's ceremony at the Kodak Theatre, the Best Actress enjoyed a spread prepared by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. On the menu: a three-course dinner of salad, Dover sole and lemon cheesecake.  Guests, including  Justin Timberlake , Best Supporting Actor winner  Christian Bale and Russell Brand, also enjoyed passed appetizers that included smoked salmon Oscar flatbread, tuna tartare in sesame miso cones, mini cheeseburgers, black truffle pizza, crispy rice and taro root tacos. There were also food stations with sushi and shellfish, a dessert bar – plus Moet & Chandon champagne.

"Is it wrong 2 hope 4 a playdate?" Spelling, 37,  tweeted Sunday night after meeting John, 63, and his partner, David Furnish, at the British music legend's Oscars after-party, held annually to raise money for his AIDS foundation.  McDermott, 44,  tweeted out a photo of himself and Spelling with John and Furnish and called it a "once in a lifetime moment."

Originally posted  02/27/2011 11:45PM  Once again, Corey Haim's  death went unnoticed by his peers.  In the montage of actors who died over the last year during the Oscars, the Academy did not include the  Lost Boys star, who succumbed to pneumonia and a heart condition on March 10, 2010, just days after last year's awards ceremony.  Haim, who was 38, also wasn't mentioned in the Screen Actors Guild montage. SAG Awards officials said the show was running too long and the "In Memoriam" had to be shortened.

"I have a feeling my career's just peaked," Firth said on the stage of Hollywood's Kodak Theatre Sunday night, at the 83rd annual Academy Awards.  The British actor was so excited he admitted to "experiencing stirrings … in the abdominal region that are threatening to turn themselves into dance moves."  Natalie Portman , as the troubled dancer in  Black Swan , was named Best Actress. "This is insane," she said in her speech. "I truly, sincerely wish the prize tonight was to work with my fellow nominees. I am in such awe of you."
