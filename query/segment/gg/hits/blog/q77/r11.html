<center><b>Notes on Policy and Legal Issues Concerning Intelligent Design
Theory</b>
<br><b>by Doug Linder (2001)</b></center>

<p>Assume for a moment that you are a member of a local school board.&nbsp;&nbsp;
At a board meeting one night, a parent stands and identifies himself as
a spokesperson for a group of upset parents.&nbsp; They understand from
their children that geography teachers in the district are teaching students
that the earth is sphericaland are not giving the students any evidence
at all for the contradictory theory that the earth is flat.&nbsp; The parents
demand to know what you and other school board members are going to do
about this dogmatic approach that is being taken to the question of the
earths shape.
<p>What should be the boards response?&nbsp; Insist upon equal time for
the flat earth theory?&nbsp; Drop the controversial subject of the earths
shape from the geography curriculum?&nbsp; Or option C: Should the board
tell the parents, While you have every right to believe the Earth is flat
and even tell your children that the earth is a big blue and green pancake,
we have a job to doand that is provide children with a view of reality
that comports with our best scientific understanding?&nbsp; I thinkin
this example, at leastwe all know the right answer.
<p>In this wonderfully diverse country of ours, it comes as no surprise
that there is an outfit called the Flat Earth Society dedicated to making,
in the words of its president, the United States a flat earth nation.&nbsp;
(The president of the Flat Earth Society, until his death two months ago,
was--some of you might find some irony in thisa man named Johnson from
California.&nbsp; In this case the Johnson is Charles Johnson, not the
Prof Phillip Johnson of Berkeley who has made Intelligent Design his crusade.)&nbsp;
Charles Johnson was interviewed in Science Magazine in the 1980sat a time
when the Space Shuttle was making headlines.&nbsp; You might have thought
that the space program would have created self-doubt among the flat-earthers,
but no: Johnson was quoted as saying, You cant orbit the earth.&nbsp;
The Space Shuttle is a jokea very ludicrous joke.&nbsp; As for the moonlanding,
Johnson said he had information that the whole thing was scripted by Arthur
C. Clarke and filmed in Hollywood.&nbsp; Flat earthers point to the Bible
for their faith in the worlds flatness.&nbsp; Johnson noted in his Science
Magazine interview that the New Testament says Jesus ascended up into heavennot
out into heaven.&nbsp; The Bible also refers to the four corners of the
earth and tells of Jesus being taken to a mountain where he could see
all the kingdoms of the earthsomething clearly not possible on a spherical
earth.&nbsp; Johnson says, Wherever you find people with a reservoir of
common sense, they dont believe such idiotic things as the earth spinning
around the sun.&nbsp; Reasonable, intelligent people have always recognized
that the earth is flat.&nbsp; The Society, in case you werent told about
this in your school, also has scientific evidence to support their flat
earth theory.&nbsp; They have checked water surfaces on Lake Tahoe and
the Salton Sea without detecting any of the curvature youd expect if the
earth were really spherical.
<p>Lets return to our school board hypothetical.&nbsp; Would your view
of what to do be any different if the parents complaints concerned teaching
that the earth revolved around the sun, rather than what was to their way
of thinking the correct view, that the sun revolves around the earth?&nbsp;
After all, the parents point our, the Bible clearly suggests an earth-centered
system: Joshua 10 tells of the sun standing still in the midst of the sky.&nbsp;
In 2 Kings, God brings the sun ten degrees backward in the sky.&nbsp; And
Ecclesiates tells of the sun going down and hastening to the place where
it arises.
<p>This, of course, was once a big-time controversy.&nbsp; Friar Giordano
Bruno was burned at the stake in 1600 for suggesting that the earth traveled
around the sun, rather than the other way around.&nbsp; The same belief,
published by Galileo, led to his conviction and arrest in 1631.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not until the time of Pope Leo XIII in the late 1800s did the Catholic
Church back off its earth-centered view.
<p>What should the school board do here?&nbsp; Same answer, right?tell
the parents that they have a constitutional right to believe whatever they
want about the configuration of the solar system, but the board has a duty
to recognize the scientific consensus in favor of the Copernicun system.
<p>Next example: Creationism.&nbsp; Parents show up and demand that biology
teachers present evidence that supports their view that Genesis, not Darwin,
got it right when it comes to explaining the variety of life on earth.&nbsp;
It all happened in six days about 6,000 or so years ago.&nbsp; The earth
was created first, then a few days later, God got around to installing
the sun and a few thousand stars. Anything that suggests a contrary viewlike
radiometric dating or radio telescopes--is a hoax or somehow flawed.
<p>Should the Board respond any differently?&nbsp; Is there significant
support for a young-earth view among scientists?&nbsp; The only thing that
makes this situation different from our flat earth and earth-centered solar
system examples is that there really are (difficult though it may be to
understand) substantial numbers of Americans who cling to this young-earth,
Creationist view.&nbsp; To tell our students that there is serious scientific
doubt about the age of the earth is to mislead them.&nbsp; There isnt.&nbsp;
And to spend class time discussing a young-earth view would be fully as
preposterous as would wasting time presenting evidence that Neil Armstrong
took his giant leap for mankind in a movie studio in southern California.
<p>As a school board member, youd have another reason not to accede to
the parents demand that Creationism be given equal time with Evolution
in the schools curriculum: The United States Supreme Court has ruled,
in a 1987 case called Edwards v Aguillard, that such so-called Balanced
Treatment laws constitute an unconstitutional establishment of religion.&nbsp;
The Court found that the only justification for requiring discussion of
Creationism whenever evolution is discussed is a religious onenot an academic
one.&nbsp; Creationism, the Court concluded, was a religious theory, not
a scientific one.
<p>Which brings us to the theory that has brought us here today.&nbsp;
Once again you are working your way through a school board agenda when
a group of parents rise to complain about the way biology classes are being
taught in the district.&nbsp; Theyve learned in their churches, read books,
visited websites, and seen videos that suggest biology teachers arent
telling it like it istheyre covering up evidence that suggests species
dont evolve into other species.&nbsp; Theyve learned, on the other hand,
that scientific evidence shows that species do not evolve into other species:
that species are separate and distinct and have all been put here as part
of an intelligent design.&nbsp; They demand that you do something to insure
this cover-up comes to an end.&nbsp; They want the school board to compel
teachers to present scientific evidence that undermines Darwins theory
of evolution.&nbsp; They want teachers, for example, to present evidence
that some biological features are too complex to have evolved, and that
the fossil record has failed to produce enough missing links to make
the case for macro-evolution.
<p>What do you do?&nbsp; Is this the Creationism controversy all over again?&nbsp;
Is Intelligent Design (to use a KU biology professors description) just
Creationism in a cheap tuxedo, or is it something genuinely different?
<p>This is where it gets hard.&nbsp; And I want to be as fair as I can
to those who believe in intelligent design.&nbsp; I have friends who believe
in intelligent design.&nbsp; Our next-door neighborsvery nice peoplebelieve
in intelligent design.&nbsp; If by intelligent design, its proponents
only meant that some intelligent designer (whether it be God, space aliens,
or a giant slug) is using evolution to accomplish some intelligent purpose
(one in which we humans might be major players), we wouldnt be here.&nbsp;
This evolution-is-part-of-Gods-plan view is, essentially, the view of
the Catholic Church, most Jews, and most mainline Protestant denominations.&nbsp;
There is no necessary conflict between a belief in evolution and a belief
that God is real and working in the world.&nbsp; The theory of evolution
says nothing at all about the existence or non-existence of a benevolent,
intelligent designer. Evolution doesnt require an intelligent creator,
but it doesnt exclude the possibility either.&nbsp; The theory of evolution
simply provides a powerful scientific explanation for the variety of life
on earth.&nbsp; It is the core concept of biology.&nbsp; It is not a disproof
of religion.
<p>Moreover, let me say this:&nbsp; If a school board were to compel its
teachers to tell students that evolution proves that there is no God;
that everything is explained solely in terms of chemicals and natural processes,
that school board would be violating the First Amendment.&nbsp; To dogmatically
teach Atheism in the public schools would be just as unconstitutional as
teaching Fundamentalism.&nbsp; Science teachers should teach science.
<p>The problem today arises because the proponents of Intelligent Design
are not content with the weak view that accepts evolution.&nbsp; Instead,
they argue that the evidence suggests individual species were individually
and intelligently designed.&nbsp; Humans and the great apes, for example,
did not have a common ancestor some 6 million years ago.&nbsp; The fact
that humans and chimps share over 98% of the same genetic material proves
little.&nbsp; The missing linksthe early hominids that keep inconveniently
popping up in Africaall must be new and separate species.&nbsp; Its just
a coincidence that the most mammal-like of all reptile fossils appear just
before the most reptile-like of all mammal fossils. The fact that no tenured
biology professor (as opposed to law professors, hydrologists, or even
a handful of biochemists) at any of the top-ranked universities shares
their conviction in the folly of evolution shows only how widespread the
Darwinian conspiracy is.
<p>Public schools shouldnt teach Intelligent Design for the very same
reason that they shouldnt teach flat-earth or Creationist theory.&nbsp;
Because it is nonsense.&nbsp; We do our students a disservice by suggesting
to them that there is a raging controversy among the worlds most prominent
biologists about the basic explanatory force of evolution.&nbsp; There
isnt any such controversy.&nbsp; We knowjust as surely as we know that
the earth revolves around the sunthat evolution has spawned earths wonderful
diversity.&nbsp; We have an obligation to tell our students the truth,
not whatever a group of well-meaning but misguided intelligent design theorists
think we should tell them.
<p>Design theory is not scienceat least not as we usually think about
it.&nbsp; Scientists assume that the physical world operates through unbroken
natural regularity.&nbsp; Every scientist who conducts an experiment assumes
that neither God, nor the Devil, nor any other supernatural being will
affect the results.
<p>There is certainly nothing wrong with a teacher observing that not everything
about evolution has been scientifically established, or pointing out that
there are disputes between those who believe evolution has proceed gradually
and those who believe it has operated more punctually, but thats a far
cry from teaching against evolution and in favor of Design Theory.
<p>Im a law professor.&nbsp; Im supposed to tell you about the law as
it relates to this controversy.&nbsp; I wish I could tell you that the
Constitution is clear about this.&nbsp; Id like to be able to say, Theres
no reason for any of us to worry about the Intelligent Design threatthe
Supreme Court will step in and save the day if it has to.&nbsp; I cant
tell you that.&nbsp; The law is not clear.
<p>The Constitution may prevent states and individual school boards and
teachers from promoting religion in the classrooms, but it doesnt prevent
states or school boards or teachers from doing stupid things.&nbsp; If
an ignorant bunch of legislators became convinced the earth was flatsimply
from their own observations and not because of Biblical Fundamentalismand
required flat earth theory to be taught in the schools, theres not a lot
the Constitution can do about that.&nbsp; In retrospect, it was stupid
for medical schools to teach the use of leeches to deal with various diseases,
but that wasnt unconstitutional either.
<p>The key question under the First Amendment is this: Is the state (or
board or teacher) acting out of religious convictions or simply out of
their own misguided understanding of science?&nbsp; If Intelligent Design
Theory is introduced into classrooms to promote Christian Fundamentalism,
that is unconstitutional.&nbsp; If it is introduced because legislators,
or board members, or individual teachers become convinced (or misled) into
believing that there is a serious scientific controversy about evolution
that students need to know about, then that is likely to be found to be
constitutional.
<p>Finally, what does all this say about the individual teacher who takes
it as his or her mission to promote Intelligent Design theory in the classroom?&nbsp;
Does the teacher have a First Amendment right to teach Design Theory?&nbsp;
Is this what academic freedom is all about?&nbsp; Could a board or principal
step in and remove or reassign the teacher to another class?&nbsp; Its
not a slamdunk, as the term is used, but I think the better answer is
yes, they do have the power to remove or reassign such teachers.&nbsp;
They do for the same reason a geography teacher who insisted upon teaching
flat earth theory could be removed: incompetence--failing to present students
with the information they need to have to continue with study in the field.&nbsp;
Firing teachers just to suppress a disfavored viewpoint may violate the
First Amendment, but states have the power and the duty to ensure competent
teaching.
<p>The temptation is for states and school boards to compromise intellectual
integrity in order to silence vocal critics.&nbsp; Besides, balanced treatment
is in vogue right now.&nbsp; This works in favor of the Intelligent Design
proponents. Every broadcast station or newspaper feels a need to be non-judgmental;
to present both sides of every issue.&nbsp; A flat-earth controversy in
Olathe?&nbsp; Better dig up a spokesperson for the flat earth viewpoint!&nbsp;
Few in the media have the courage to say: This view is right, and that
view is wrong.
<p>My questionfor which I give no answeris this: Is it better for educators
to hit the issue of Intelligent Design head on, or to ignore it and hope
that it will go away.&nbsp; Is it better to expose the so-called refutations
of evolution?&nbsp; Is it better to make clear to students what a tiny,
tiny minority of professional scientists subscribe to Intelligent Design
theory?&nbsp; By saying nothing about Intelligent Design, do we harm our
students who have been duped into thinking that there is a raging controversy
going on among prominent biologists?&nbsp; Do we just teach evolutionor
do we teach against the misleading information pouring out of Intelligent
Design proponents?
<p>John Adams, our second president, is hot right now.&nbsp; A biography
about him by David McCullough is on top of the bestseller list.&nbsp; Let
me quote John Adams, who said in 1770, as an attorney in the Boston Massacre
trial, Facts are stubborn things.&nbsp; Yes, facts are stubborn. They
insist on being considered.&nbsp; In the end, I believe, facts will lead
to the downfall of Intelligent Design theory. But that may take awhile.&nbsp;
Remember, it took the Catholic Church over 200 years to remove its ban
on the publication of Galileos book, Dialogue in Two World Systems.
<p>And when the evolution controversy dies down, the Big Bang and pre-Big
Bang controversies will be here to keep us entertained.&nbsp; In so many
ways, it seems, science is undermining our pleasant beliefs about the specialness
of our species and our place in the universe.&nbsp; It takes both courage
and imagination for religious people to reconcile the facts of science
with a God-centered view of the world.&nbsp; But it can be done.
