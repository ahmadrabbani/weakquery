It is hyperbole to say these fields “can’t exist” without evolutionary theory. Trudeau’s character also asserts that intelligent design is just “creationism renamed to get it in the classroom.” Assigning motives to your opposition does nothing to discredit their argument. And certainly evolution supporters are working hard to maintain their monopoly on our classrooms, even teaching the religious idea that evolution all happened by random processes without intervention by the hand of God. I’m not a biblical inerrantist, and think there are some pretty strong arguments supporting evolution, and some arguments that make the whole thing (unless miraculously designed or assisted by God) pretty unlikely. We should be honest enough in the classroom to teach the controversy. — Dan Hochberg, Seattle           E-mail article   Print  Share:                   News where, when and how you want it  On Facebook  On Twitter  On your phone  On your doorstep     Newsline Daily E-mail A roundup of the top headlines from news, sports, business, editorial and entertainment.
