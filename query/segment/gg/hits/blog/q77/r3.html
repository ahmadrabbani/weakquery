        six billion years. The nuclear force was needed to bind protons and

      <a name="antievolution">Intelligent design</a> 
      (ID) is an anti-evolution belief asserting that naturalistic explanations 
      of some biological entities are not possible and such entities can only be 
      explained by intelligent causes.<a href="http://www.intelligentdesignnetwork.org/">*</a>&nbsp; Advocates of ID maintain that their 
      belief
      is scientific and provides empirical proof for
      the existence of God or superintelligent aliens.  They claim that intelligent design should be taught in the science
      classroom as an alternative to the <a href="science.html">science</a> of 
      evolution. ID is essentially a hoax, however, since evolution is consistent with a 
      belief in an intelligent designer of the universe and with an unlimited 
      number of other metaphysical myths. The two are not 
      contradictory and they are not necessarily competitors, though evolution 
      clearly contradicts the creation stories of numerous religions. ID is proposed mainly by 
      Christian apologists at the <a href="http://www.discovery.org/">Discovery Institute</a> 
      and their allies, who oppose the science of evolution because it threatens their 
      hidebound, literalistic view of Bible stories. The approach of the 
      Discovery Institute to scientific discoveries that contradict their 
      literal understanding of the Bible is reminiscent of the early 
      twentieth-century organization known as the
      <a href="http://skepdic.com/wacfundies.html">World Association of 
      Christian Fundamentalists</a>.</font></p>

    when the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html">
    Supreme
    Court ruled </a>religious doctrines can't be promoted in secular 
    institutions because they violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Judge 
    Jones wrote in his decision regarding a policy of the Dover, Pennsylvania, 
    school district that added ID to the school's biology program:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The citizens of the Dover area were 
    poorly served by the members of the Board who voted for the ID Policy. It is 
    ironic that several of these individuals, who so staunchly and proudly 
    touted their religious convictions in public, would time and again lie to

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="creationism">The arguments</a> of the ID advocates may seem like a rehash
      of the <a href="creation.html">creationist</a> arguments, but the
      defenders of ID claim that they do not reject evolution simply because it
      does not fit with their understanding of the Bible. In fact, some ID 
      proponents (e.g., Michael Behe) claim that they do not reject evolution. However, they present
      natural selection as implying the universe could not have been designed or
      created, which is nonsense. To deny that an all-powerful god has the power to create
      living things using natural selection is to assert something unknowable.
      It is also inconsistent with the belief in an omnipotent creator, which, 
      presumably, could use any method it desires to do anything it does.&nbsp;(Here we skirt by the deep theological issue of whether an 
      omnipotent being could create an object it couldn't move.)</font></p>

      of natural selection as implying (1) the Judeo-Christian god doesn't exist, (2) natural
      selection could only have happened randomly and by chance, and (3)
      whatever happens randomly and by chance cannot be designed by a god. None of
      these beliefs is essential to natural selection. There is no inconsistency
      in believing in a god that created the universe and believing in natural selection 
      as well, 
      though it is true that evolution provides a non-theistic explanation of 
      the origin of species.
      Natural selection could have been designed by a god, though it does seem 
      more in tune with the nature of the Jewish god to have made little clay figurines 
      and blown life into them.  </font></p>

      Dembski, author of <i>Intelligent Design: The Bridge between Science and Theology</i>

      <a href="http://www.discovery.org/">Discovery
      Institute</a>, a Seattle research institute funded largely by Christian
      foundations. Their arguments are attractive because they are couched in
      mathematical or scientific terms and backed by what seems to be scientific competence. However, their
      arguments are identical in function to the <a href="creation.html">creationists'

      rather than provide positive evidence for their own position, they mainly

      <a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~inbios/news/evolution.htm">Lehigh University 
      (read this disclaimer from his department)</a>. Behe's argument is not essentially about whether evolution occurred, but
      how it had to have occurred. He claims that he
      wants to see &quot;real laboratory research on the question of intelligent
      design.&quot;<a href="http://www.reall.org/newsletter/v07/n12/index.html">*</a>&nbsp; Behe claims that biochemistry reveals a cellular world of
      such precisely tailored molecules and such staggering complexity that it
      is not only inexplicable by gradual evolution, but that it can  be
      plausibly explained only&nbsp; by assuming an intelligent designer, i.e., 
      the Judeo-Christian god. Some
      systems, he thinks, can't be produced by natural selection because
      &quot;any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a
      part is by definition nonfunctional&quot; (Behe 1996: 39). He says that a mousetrap
      is an example of an irreducibly complex system, i.e., all the parts must
      be there in order for the mousetrap to function. In short, Behe has old
      wine in a new skin: the <font> <a href="design.html"> argument from design</a>
      </font>wrapped in biochemistry. His argument is no more scientific than
      any other variant of the argument from design. In fact, most scientists,
      including scientists who are Christians, think Behe should cease patting
      himself on the back. As with all other such arguments, Behe's begs the
      question. He must assume design in order to prove a designer.  </font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">His argument hinges  on the notion of
      &quot;irreducibly complex systems,&quot; systems that could not function
      if they were missing just one of their many parts. &quot;Irreducibly
      complex systems ... cannot evolve in a Darwinian fashion,&quot; he says,
      because natural selection works on small mutations in just one component
      at a time. He then leaps to the conclusion that intelligent design must be
      responsible for these irreducibly complex systems. Biology professor (and
      Christian) Kenneth Miller responds:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The multiple parts of complex, interlocking
        biological systems do not evolve as individual parts, despite Behe's
        claim that they must. They evolve together, as systems that are
        gradually expanded, enlarged, and adapted to new purposes. As Richard
        Dawkins successfully argued in <i>The Blind Watchmaker</i>, natural
        selection can act on these evolving systems at every step of their
        transformation.</font><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><a href="http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/behe-review/index.html"><font size="3">*</font></a></font></p>

        gradually by adding parts that, while initially just advantageous, 
        become - because of later changes - essential. The logic is very simple. 
        Some part (A) initially does some job (and not very well, perhaps). 
        Another part (B) later gets added because it helps A. This new part 
        isn't essential, it merely improves things. But later on, A (or 
        something else) may change in such a way that B now becomes 
        indispensable. This process continues as further parts get folded into

      provocative ideas.&quot;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/050530fa_fact">*</a> 
      He claims that he can prove that it is
      <a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/2002-11/dembski.html">highly improbable</a> that life and the
      universe happened by chance and by natural processes; they are most likely the result of intelligent design by 
      the Christian god. He also
      claims that &quot;the conceptual soundness of a scientific theory cannot
      be maintained apart from Christ&quot; (<i>Intelligent Design: The Bridge between 
      Science and Theology</i>, 1998, p. 209).</font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">His basic argument is that some things could not 
      have been produced by chance. He believes that an object must be the 
      product of intelligent design if it shows âspecified complexity.â If you 
      came home and found &quot;I love you&quot; spelled out in potato chips on the couch, 
      the probability of something so specific and complex being the result of 
      chance is nearly zero. Dembski thinks some things in nature clearly 
      demonstrate specified complexity, e.g., the eye. A similar argument was 
      made by William Paley (1743-1805), the Archdeacon of Carlisle, in his <i>
      Natural Theology</i> (1802). It is true that Darwin himself admitted that 
      it seems absurd to suppose that </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for 
        adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different 
        amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic 
        aberration, could have been formed by natural selection....</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">However, he reasoned that</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex 
      eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its 
      possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so 
      slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; 
      and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an 
      animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing 
      that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, 
      though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real.
      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Science has proved Darwin right (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040308093701/http:/www.origins.tv/darwin/eyes.htm">Patterson 
    2002</a>). We now know that the vision system consists of many different 
    components that perform specialized tasks such as detecting edges or motion. 
    The optic nerve takes two pathways to the brain and  one obviously 
    evolved much earlier than the other. Different kinds of visual systems have 
    evolved at different times in different species. All these systems could 
    have been produced by an intelligent designer, either of the Judeo-Christian 
    type or of any of an unlimited number of other types. But none of the 
    systems of the eye requires an intelligent designer to explain its origin or 
    development. 
    Numerous gradual changes and adaptations are sufficient to explain even the 
    most complex visual system.</font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Dembski also uses a number of mathematical notions 
      to debunk evolution. &quot;In 2002, he focused on so-called No Free Lunch, or 
      N.F.L., theorems, which were derived in the late nineties by the 
      physicists David H. Wolpert and William G. Macready.&quot;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/050530fa_fact">*</a> 
      Since most of us are
      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0679726012/roberttoddcarrolA/">
      innumerate</a>, the arguments may seem dazzling. However, as H. Allen Orr 
      notes: &quot;Despite all the attention, Dembskiâs mathematical claims about 
      design and Darwin are almost entirely beside the point.&quot;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/050530fa_fact">*</a></font></p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The most serious problem in Dembskiâs account 
      involves specified complexity. Organisms arenât trying to match any 
      âindependently given patternâ: evolution has no goal, and the history of 
      life isnât trying to get anywhere. If building a sophisticated structure 
      like an eye increases the number of children produced, evolution may well 
      build an eye. But if destroying a sophisticated structure like the eye 
      increases the number of children produced, evolution will just as happily 
      destroy the eye. Species of fish and crustaceans that have moved into the 
      total darkness of caves, where eyes are both unnecessary and costly, often 
      have degenerate eyes, or eyes that begin to form only to be covered by 
      skinâcrazy contraptions that no intelligent agent would design. Despite 
      all the loose talk about design and machines, organisms arenât striving to 
      realize some engineerâs blueprint; theyâre striving (if they can be said 
      to strive at all) only to have more offspring than the next fellow. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Another problem with Dembskiâs arguments concerns 
      the N.F.L. theorems. Recent work shows that these theorems donât hold in 
      the case of co-evolution, when two or more species evolve in response to 
      one another. And most evolution is surely co-evolution. Organisms do not 
      spend most of their time adapting to rocks; they are perpetually 
      challenged by, and adapting to, a rapidly changing suite of viruses, 
      parasites, predators, and prey. A theorem that doesnât apply to these 
      situations is a theorem whose relevance to biology is unclear. As it 
      happens, David Wolpert, one of the authors of the N.F.L. theorems, 
      recently denounced Dembskiâs use of those theorems as âfatally informal 
      and imprecise.â Dembskiâs apparent response has been a tactical retreat. 
      In 2002, Dembski triumphantly proclaimed, âThe No Free Lunch theorems dash 
      any hope of generating specified complexity via evolutionary algorithms.â 
      Now he says, âI certainly never argued that the N.F.L. theorems provide a 
      direct refutation of Darwinism.â (<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/050530fa_fact">Orr 
      2005</a>) [Note: &quot;Darwinism&quot; is not a scientific term; it is a polemical 
      termâlike <i>Maoism</i>âdesigned to incite opposition to evolution.]</font></p>

      <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">According to another critic - physicist Vic Stenger 
      (<i><a href="http://www.csicop.org/sb/2000-12/reality-check.html">&quot;The
      Emperor's New Designer Clothes&quot;</a>) - </i>Dembski uses math and logic
      to derive what he calls <i>the law of conservation of information</i>.
      &quot;He argues that the information contained in living structures cannot
      be generated by any combination of chance and natural processes....Dembski's
      law of conservation of information is nothing more than &quot;conservation
      of entropy,&quot; a special case of the second law [of thermodynamics]
      that applies when no dissipative processes such as friction are
      present.&quot; However, the fact is that &quot;entropy is created
      naturally a thousand times a day by every person on Earth. Each time any
      friction is generated, information is lost.&quot;</font></p>

        program. Though people often picture science as a collection of clever 
        theories, scientists are generally staunch pragmatists: to scientists, a 
        good theory is one that inspires new experiments and provides unexpected 
        insights into familiar phenomena. By this standard, Darwinism is one of 
        the best theories in the history of science: it has produced countless 
        important experiments (letâs re-create a natural species in the labâyes, 
        thatâs been done) and sudden insight into once puzzling patterns (thatâs 
        why there are no native land mammals on oceanic islands). In the nearly 
        ten years since the publication of Beheâs book, by contrast, I.D. has 
        inspired no nontrivial experiments and has provided no surprising 
        insights into biology. As the years pass, intelligent design looks less 
        and less like the science it claimed to be and more and more like an

      of an intelligent designer. Unless this intelligent designer is one of us,
      i.e., human, and unless we have some experience with the creations of this
      and similar designers, how could we proceed to study this system? If all

      conflict between a mechanistic view of nature and a teleological view,
      between a naturalistic and a supernaturalistic view of nature. Nature 
      could be thought of as a vast purposive mechanism. With the
      notable exception of <a href="http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/4j.htm#god">Leibniz</a>
      and his intellectual descendents, just about everyone else gave up the idea of scientific explanations
      needing to include theological ones. Scientific progress became possible in part
      because scientists attempted to describe the workings of natural phenomena
      without reference to their creation, design, or ultimate purpose. A god may 
      well have created the universe and the laws of nature, but nature is still a machine, mechanically changing and comprehensible as such. God
      became an unnecessary hypothesis, as

      viable alternative to evolution.<a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/pressroom.asp?year=2005">*</a> 
      These two claims might well be called the <i>ID twin towers</i>. Neither 
      of these claims is true but it doesn't matter at this point because they 
      are so widely believed that we must still ask whether ID should be taught 
      in our biology classrooms. There is also much hypocrisy and deceit in a 
      movement that does not refer to any gods in published documents as the 
      intelligent designer, but opens its public presentations with a Christian 
      prayer and doesn't hesitate to refer to the Christian god when alternatives such as 
      aliens as the designers are brought up.<a href="http://skepdic.com/refuge/bunk19.html">*</a> 
      Dembski puts it this way:</font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Intelligent design is a modest position 
      theologically and philosophically. It attributes the complexity and 
      diversity of life to intelligence, but does not identify that intelligence 
      with the God of any religious faith or philosophical system. The task for 
      the Christian who accepts intelligent design is therefore to formulate a 
      theology of nature and creation that makes sense of intelligent design in 
      light of oneâs Christian faith.<a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/172/story_17219_1.html#cont">*</a></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">In other words, you Christians know who 
      the intelligent designer is even though we don't mention any names!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">As evidence of how widespread the 
      belief is in the ID twin towers consider that the President of the United 
      States (who has probably never even heard of Behe or Dembski, much less 
      read anything by them<a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200508030005">*</a>) 
      has stated publicly that ID should be taught in our schools.<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/02/AR2005080201686.html">*</a> 
      The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), the world's largest 
      organization of science educators, issued a press release saying it was 
      &quot;stunned and disappointed that President Bush is endorsing the teaching of 
      intelligent design -- effectively opening the door for non-scientific 
      ideas to be taught in the nation's K-12 science classrooms.&quot;<a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/08-03-2005/0004081557&EDATE=">*</a> 
      I understand why the teachers are disappointed but they shouldn't be 
      stunned. President Bush's opinion is shared by millions of Americans. 
      According to a recent Harris poll, only 12% of Americans think evolution 
      should be taught to the exclusion of creationism and ID.<a href="http://www.skepdic.com/news/newsletter57.html#8">*</a> 
      In any case, John Marburger, the&nbsp; president's science advisor, 
      clarified Bush's remarks by telling the press that âevolution is the 
      cornerstone of modern biologyâ and ''intelligent design is not a 
      scientific concept.'' He said it would be over-interpreting Bushâs 
      comments to interpret them to mean that the president thinks intelligent 
      design should be placed on an equal footing with evolution. &quot;If such 
      things are to be taught in the public schools,&quot; said Marburger, &quot;they 
      belong in a course on comparative religion, which is a particularly 
      appropriate subject for our children given the present state of the 
      world.&quot;<a href="http://www.physorg.com/news5618.html">*</a></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="kansas">A number</a> of state and local school 
      boards have brought ID into their classrooms. In 1999, the Kansas Board of 
      Education rejected evolution as a scientific principle. The 10-member 
      board voted six to four to eliminate evolution from the science curricula. The Kansas 
      board did not ban the teaching of 
      evolution. Only the legislature has that kind of power. The board simply 
      deleted any mention of evolution and the Big Bang theory from the science 
      curriculum and from the materials used to test graduating students. 
      Creationists such as board member Steve Abrams, a former head of the state 
      Republican Party, hailed the decision as a victory in the war against 
      evolutionists. Creationists want children to believe that a god made them 
      and every other species individually for a purpose. They do not want 
      children to think that a divine power might be behind the Big Bang or 
      evolution of species because that opens the possibility that the Christian 
      god might not 
      exist. Creationism maintains that a god created everything, a belief that 
      leaves no room for an explanation of the existence and nature of things 
      without reference to a god. Abrams wanted to add to the science curriculum 
      standards the assertion that &quot;the design and complexity of the design of 
      the cosmos requires an intelligent designer,&quot; but his circular reasoning 
      was voted down.
      </font></p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Nevertheless, the Kansas board recognized 
    micro-evolution - natural selection within a species - as a fact. Perhaps 
    the six who voted for the new standards do not understand that natural 
    selection within species was what stimulated Darwin to his general theory of 
    evolution. Nor do they seem to understand that you can't have a theory of 
    evolution without the fact of evolution (any more than you could have a 
    theory of planetary motion without the fact of planetary motion). Scientific 
    theories are explanations as to how things happen. You don't try to explain 
    how something happened unless it happened. Natural selection is one theory 
    as to how evolution happened. It assumes evolution is a fact.</font></p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">In 2002 an election returned a majority to the Kansas 
    state board of education who were in favor of teaching just science in the 
    biology classroom. In 2004 another election  tipped the scales back in 
    favor of the ID folks. The new group called for hearings to decide whether 
    ID would be taught. The hearings were
    <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2005/KS/128_biologists_snub_39kangaroo__3_30_2005.asp">
    boycotted</a> by the scientific community, party because they felt the board 
    had already made up its mind about ID and evolution, and partly because they 
    did not want to convey the appearance of scientific legitimacy on the ID 
    movement. On August 9, 2005, the Kansas State Board of Education voted 6-4 
    in favor of new state science standards composed with the aid of a local 
    &quot;intelligent design&quot; group, the Intelligent Design Network, that 
    &quot;systematically deprecates the scientific status of evolution.&quot;<a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2005/KS/78_flawed_draft_of_kansas_standar_8_10_2005.asp">*</a> 
    Not only were the standards approved, but the board rewrote the definition 
    of science so that it is no longer limited to the search for natural 
    explanations of phenomena.<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/dn8289.html">*</a> 
    Similar proposals have been passed in other school districts. However, eight school board members 
    who passed an anti-evolution standard in Dover, Pennsylvania, were all voted 
    out of office in November 2005. The newly elected group all support ID but 
    think it is a religious doctrine and should be taught in a philosophy or 
    world religions class. As noted above, a federal judge agreed with them.</font></p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Politically active creationists failed in their 
    attempts to have creationism taught alongside evolution as a science. The 
    Supreme Court ruled that compelling the teaching of creationism was 
    tantamount to teaching religion, which state schools may not do under the 
    First Amendment separation clause. The so-called creation science movement, 
    however, is not dead. They have just changed tactics. The goal now is to 
    debunk evolution wherever possible, using any means necessary. One of their 
    favorite tactics today is to blame all sin and crime on lack of proper Bible 
    study and the teaching of &quot;godless&quot; theories such as natural selection and 
    the Big Bang theory. Marc Looy of the creationist group Answers in Genesis 
    hailed the Kansas school board decision because </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">...students in public schools are being taught that 
      evolution is a fact, that they're just products of survival of the 
      fittest....It creates a sense of purposelessness and hopelessness, which I 
      think leads to things like pain, murder, and suicide. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">That there is no scientific evidence to support these 
    claims is a matter of indifference to those who believe them. No matter. The 
    Christian doctrine of original sin explains the origin of pain, murder, and 
    suicide; thank you very much.</font></p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="alabama">In Alabama</a>, biology textbooks carry a warning that 
    says that evolution is &quot;a controversial theory some scientists present as a 
    scientific explanation for the origin of living things. . . .No one was 
    present when life first appeared on earth. Therefore, any statement about 
    life's origins should be considered as theory, not fact.&quot; Right. In Alabama, 
    I guess, if you wake up to snow on the ground, but no one saw it snowing, 
    then you may only propose a hypothesis as to the origin of the snow. The great 
    state of Alabama apparently is banking on their students being too dumb to 
    recognize language that tries to deceive and manipulate them. </font></p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="georgia">The school</a> board in Cobb County, Georgia, was perhaps 
    inspired by Alabama. In 2003, the board claimed it was just encouraging 
    critical thinking when it required a sticker be placed in all biology texts 
    that states:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">This textbook contains material on 
      evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of 
      living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, 
      studied carefully and critically considered. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Six parents and the American Civil 
    Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit against the Cobb County school board 
    over the disclaimer stickers.&nbsp; In August 2005, U.S. District Judge 
    Clarence Cooper ordered the school system to remove the stickers. The 
    disclaimers, ruled Judge Cooper, are an unconstitutional endorsement of 
    religion. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">By denigrating evolution, the school 
      board appears to be endorsing the well-known prevailing alternative 
      theory, creationism or variations thereof, even though the sticker does 
      not specifically reference any alternative theories.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The school board issued a statement 
    indicating that they just don't get it.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The textbook stickers are a reasonable 
      and evenhanded guide to science instruction and encouraging students to be 
      critical thinkers.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The plaintiffs had argued that the 
    disclaimers violated the separation of church and state and unfairly singled 
    out evolution from all other scientific theories as suspect. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Judge Cooper wisely stated in his 
    decision</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">While evolution is subject to 
      criticism, particularly with respect to the mechanism by which it 
      occurred, the sticker misleads students regarding the significance and 
      value of evolution in the scientific community.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">It certainly does. There are no stickers 
    in the physics or chemistry books. There are none in the social science 
    books. And there certainly are no warning stickers on Bibles sold in Cobb 
    country or elsewhere, though their probably should be. The only theory singled out by the school board is evolution and the 
    reason was obvious to the judge: the theory of evolution is understood as 
    implying that a god didn't make the species one by one and that a god isn't even 
    necessary for making any species at all. If evolution is correct, the school 
    board members and the thousands of parents (2,300, to be exact) who support 
    them believe that then their religious views are wrong. Accepting evolution 
    is as much as accepting atheism. It is the same as believing we have no 
    souls and are nothing but material beings with no possibility of an 
    afterlife. According to recent polls, about 35% of Americans believe that 
    evolution implies no god, no soul, no afterlife, no truth in the Bible. 
    (Other polls put the number as high as 55%. I suspect the different result 
    is due to the way the questions were asked and the kind of responses 
    allowed.) A 2005 national survey by the Harris polling agency found that 54% 
    say they do not believe humans evolved from earlier species, while 64% 
    believe that human beings were created directly by a god.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">As a result of
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061117061401/http:/www.ncseweb.org/selman/">the decision in the Cobb county 
    case</a>, the school district in Beebe, Arkansas - at the urging of the 
    American Civil Liberties Union - removed stickers they had ordered to be 
    placed in science textbooks ten or fifteen years earlier. The stickers 
    described evolution as &quot;controversial&quot; and mentioned an &quot;intelligent 
    designer&quot; as a possible explanation for the origin of life. Authorities in 
    Alabama, however, did not follow suit. They claimed they didn't see how the 
    ruling in Georgia applied to them.</font></p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="ohio">On March 9, 2004</a>, the Ohio state board of education 
    approved by a 13-5 margin what it called a &quot;Critical Analysis of Evolution&quot; 
    plan. An early draft of the plan made an explicit reference to <i>
    <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/icons/">Icons of Evolution</a></i> by 
    Jonathan Wells, a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute. The final plan 
    made no mention of Wells or his book, but critics of the plan said it 
    contained many of the concepts in Icons. Defenders of the decision call it a 
    victory for common sense over scientific dogmatism. In reality, it is a 
    victory for those who would have politicians deciding what is proper 
    science. The first question in the &quot;student reflection&quot; portion of the 
    &quot;Critical Analysis of Evolution&quot; is loaded: &quot;Why is it important for scientists to 
    critically analyze evolution?&quot; The question assumes that most scientists haven't or don't 
    critically analyze evolution, or that they don't realize it is important to 
    do so. It assumes that scientists need to be reminded of both the question 
    and its importance. To provide students with a lesson plan that implies that 
    scientists have put forth their views on evolution without critical analysis 
    would be ludicrous if it weren't so dangerous. Bettysue Feuer, regional 
    director of the Anti-Defamation League, noted that the
    <a href="http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.html">wedge document</a> 
    is at work here. If you teach that there is a controversy over evolution, 
    intelligent design advocates get their foot in the door, and can push their 
    religious agenda. </font></p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="missouri">In Missouri 
    </a>Rep. Wayne Cooper sponsored legislation 
    calling for the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolution in public 
    elementary and secondary schools. Said Cooper: &quot;We just want people to quit 
    passing on their philosophic bias as though it is the truth when it's not 
    proven.&quot; He also asserted: &quot;If we're just a piece of matter in a meaningless 
    universe, you're going to treat yourself different than if you're a designed 
    product.&quot; Call me old-fashioned but I can't think of anything more degrading 
    that being a piece of matter designed to fulfill some divine being's plan. I 
    don't have quite the admiration Mr. Cooper does for the idea of being 
    created to worship and obey a master. This might give his life meaning but 
    it seems demeaning to me. </font></p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">If we are going to allow the Christian version of 
    intelligent design to be taught in our science classrooms, to be fair we 
    should also allow the atheistic <a href="raelian.html">RaÃ«lians</a> have their say. The following is 
    from a press release from that group:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">His Holiness RaÃ«l draws the exceptional accuracy of 
      his scientific and humanitarian vision from the Message He received in 
      1973 from the Elohim, a very advanced race of human beings from a distant 
      planet within our galaxy. The Elohim created all life on Earth 
      scientifically using DNA (including humans in their image) and were 
      mistaken for God, which explains why the name Elohim is present in all 
      original Bibles. The Bible is, in fact, an atheist book describing the 
      scientific creation of life on Earth. The new concept of &quot;Intelligent 
      Design&quot; fits perfectly with this explanation of our origins. Thirty years 
      ago the Elohim explained to RaÃ«l that human cloning coupled with memory 
      transfer would one day allow humans to live forever on Earth. Today this 
      prediction is close to becoming a reality, as it has been for millennia on 
      the Elohim's planet. It is, in fact, how the Elohim resurrected Jesus, 
      their messenger, as well as many others whom they sent to guide humanity 
      and who now live on their planet. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">A &quot;critical analysis&quot; of evolution shouldn't exclude 
    RaÃ«l's vision, especially since the master himself thinks ID fits with his 
    godless religion and an atheistic Bible. That's certainly an &quot;alternative&quot; 
    viewpoint that you won't find in most science texts. What are the odds that 
    Ohioâor any other stateâwill include it or
    <a href="http://www.venganza.org/">other alternatives</a> in a &quot;Critical Analysis of 
    Evolution&quot; plan?</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="dover2">In October</a>, 2004, the Dover Area School Board 
    in York, Pennsylvania, voted 6-3 to add ID to the districtâs biology 
    curriculum. One Dover board member resigned in tears after the vote, saying 
    she was tired of being asked if she was &quot;born again.&quot; Only one community 
    member spoke in favor of the ID proposal and he home-schools his kids. 
    William Buckingham, one of the board members who led the fight for ID 
    inclusion in the biology curriculum, was reported in the local newspaper as having &quot;challenged 
    peopleâs literacy, knowledge of American history and patriotism throughout 
    the night.&quot; The following month the school district chose four new board 
    members (from 13 candidates): &quot;a preacher, a home-schooler who doesn't 
    send his kids to public school because of his religious beliefs, and two 
    others with barely any experience in government.&quot; No one who spoke out 
    against intelligent design was selected. As noted above, however, all eight 
    school board members who supported the ID requirement were voted out of 
    office in 2005.  </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Several Dover parents filed suit against 
    the school district on the grounds that introducing ID into the science 
    classroom was unconstitutional because ID is a thinly disguised religious 
    idea. When federal Judge John E. Jones III ruled against the school board in
    <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller_342.pdf">Kitzmiller v. Dover</a>, 
    he commented on &quot;the breathtaking inanity of the Boardâs 
    decision ... when considered against the factual backdrop which has 
    now been fully revealed through this trial.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Judge Jones was not fooled by the 
    hypocritical claims of ID advocates that they are just critical thinkers 
    defending science, freedom of speech, and fair play. Despite the fact that 
    the whole world has been made aware of the game the ID folks have been 
    playing,
    <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=3114&program=CSC&callingPage=discoMainPage">
    John G. West of the Discovery Institute</a> defiantly wrote after the 
    decision was handed down:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Evolutionists used to style themselves the champions 
      of free speech and academic freedom against unthinking dogmatism. But 
      increasingly, they have become the new dogmatists, demanding 
      judicially-imposed censorship of dissent. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">As Mr. West knows, no judge has censored 
    ID. Those who advocate this philosophical anti-science idea are still free 
    to express their views. The fact is, conservative Republican Judge Jones 
    recognized that ID is no more a serious scientific contender to natural 
    selection than creation in six days by an invisible guy in the sky or 
    creation of earthly life forms in an alien laboratory on some other planet. 
    But don't expect the ID folks at the Discovery Institute to come clean and 
    admit their program of deception. They're on a mission to confuse people 
    about evolution and seem to believe that the end justifies the means. If 
    they have to lie and deceive to get people to doubt evolution, then so be 
    it.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Meanwhile, in Blufton, Indiana, the local school 
    board announced that ID will continue to be a part of 
    Bluffton-Harrisonâs High School science curriculum. The school board voted 
    4-1 to continue requiring the districtâs science educators to discuss 
    âappropriate theoriesâ â such as intelligent design and evolution â and give 
    a âfair and balancedâ presentation when teaching about the origin of the 
    universe and life. The Discovery Institute folks must be smiling: an issue 
    that has nothing to do with balance and fairness has been turned into a 
    fairness issue.</font></p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">So, should we teach ID in 
    our biology classrooms even though ID is not a viable alternative to natural 
    selection? The answer is &quot;yes, if we teach ID properly.&quot; The answer is &quot;no&quot; 
    if we are asked to teach ID as a viable scientific idea worth spending 
    precious classroom time on. To teach ID properly would be to demonstrate to 
    the students that nothing of scientific interest follows after one posits an 
    external agent to explain something. To say the eye was 
    designed by God or an alien race is to say: <i>Stop, go no further in trying to understand this; 
    give up; don't do science</i>. 
    Students might be taught that ID is just the kind of belief that some 
    philosophers and theologians find interesting but since it doesn't lead to 
    any deeper understanding of biological mechanisms, doesn't lead to new 
    discoveries or research ventures, and doesn't have any practical scientific

      The End of Intelligent Design? </a>by Stephen M. Barr, professor of 
      physics. <br>
      What has the intelligent design movement achieved? As science, nothing. 
      The goal of science is to increase our understanding of the natural world, 
      and there is not a single phenomenon that we understand better today or 
      are likely to understand better in the future through the efforts of ID 
      theorists. If we are to look for ID achievements, then, it must be in the 
      realm of natural theology. And there, I think, the movement must be judged 
      not only a failure, but a debacle. </font></font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font size="3" face="Arial">For a critical 
      commentary on Barr&#39;s bashing of ID see Jason Rosenhouse&#39;s

      The ID folks are tapping into deep intuitions people have that complex, 
      functioning structures do not arise from natural, non-intelligent causes. 
      Many are already uncomfortable with the naturalism of modern science and 
      see evolution as dehumanizing and implausible. They like the idea that 
      modern science can provide some rational support for theism. My 
      experiences at ID gatherings suggest to me that an awful lot of people are 
      being led just where they want to go.</font></p>
