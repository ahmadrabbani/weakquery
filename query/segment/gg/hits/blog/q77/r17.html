Am I missing something about IC?  Behe wrote a whole book about it so I assume there is more to it (I am going to read the book -- Darwin's Black Box -- soon but right now it is checked out of the library).<br />
<br />
The following is a quote from someone I've met personally and seen in debate. I can't personally verify his claims (I don't have the resources to do so), but it gives an indication of where ID proponents are coming from.<br />
Natural processes, over the history of the universe, have the potential to produce up to 70 bits of information. Unfortunately, just one, average 300-residue protein requires about 500 bits to encode. The simplest theoretical life form would need somewhere in the neighbourhood of 250 protein-coding genes. <br />
<br />
If there are some anxious thoughts within the minds of Darwinists right now, it has to do with getting the first organism assembled, and getting all the thousands of novel protein-coding genes necessary for the diversity of life. <br />
<br />
Research in this area is increasingly relying on computer simulations, the latest of which was just published in Nature this past year. That simulation failed to achieve 32 bits when the intervening stepping stones were removed. In the formation of a stable, folding protein, there are no intermediate non-folding steps that can be selected for. <br />
<br />
If evolving multiple components simultaneously is required for evolution to occur, then the number of bits of info to achieve that process would multiply, and the probability is then reduced considerably, if not completely eliminated. Again, I'm not an expert in the living sciences, and I cannot personally verify the research performed by ID supporters.</div></div><hr />

I was attempting to address Behe's claim, which does reject evolution.  And to say that the New Earth creationists do not advocate intelligent design is absurd. Some of them do, some of them don't. Yes Hovind accepts an intelligent designer, but I would be surprised if he supported a cause that didn't define who the Creator was. Hovind starts with the Bible, ID starts with nature. That's the distinction.  They say God created it.  They are creationists. Right.  And I have researched these people.  If you think that Kent Hovind doesn't assume his conclusions, you obviously haven't researched him yourself.  Though I don't think he is very scholarly, especially considering his unwillingness to be peer-reviewed by other creation scientists, I do not think he assumes his conclusions. He assumes the earth is 6000 years old because that's what the Bible says. Which would be pretty good evidence if one could show that the Bible is inerrant and Genesis 1,2 is meant to be interpreted in such and such a fashion. Anyway, his webiste goes well beyond the mere fact that the Bible says so. Yes, it is his starting point, but it shouldn't be misrepresented in saying that the Bible is his only argument for a young earth.  Nowhere does he offer evidence that this is true. I'm not here to defend him, there are certain things he has kept on his website that have a lot of young earthers upset. He needs to stop supporting fraudulent archaeologists. Anyway, saying he provides no evidence is just another way of you saying you don't agree with his evidence. I think you should word your assertions more clearly. He just presents faulty evidence that appears to justify that claim, or attempts to delegitimize any claim that doesn't support it. So he does provide evidence. Ok. You don't agree with his evidence. Fine. There are many things he says I don't agree with either.  And then he concludes that the earth is 6000 years old.  That's what assuming your conclusion is. Except that he provided other evidence. You just don't agree with it. I could just as well say that you are assuming your conclusions because the evidence you provide is faulty. It's not logical to say that. Assuming your conclusions requires intent.  Same goes for Behe.  Nowhere does it logically proceed from Irreducible Complexity that a God must have created it.  The only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that either macroevolution didn't happen, or that our existing understanding of macroevolution is flawed.  Drawing a metaphysical conclusion from empirical evidence isn't sound arguing.  That sounds like a misrepresentation to me. And that's why I discussed the false dichotomy inherent in their reasoning.  If Behe simply used his arguments simply to criticize evolution, and did not use it as an argument for intelligent design, I wouldn't have a problem with it.Ok. If only there were other competing theories other than creation and naturalism. I can't even conceive a third alternative. Oh well. I do agree with you that there are many philosophical elements to the discussion of ID.</div></div><hr />

You are correct in considering the number of Earth-like planets there are. I don't personally know how many there are. One would need to first establish that sentient beings could be produced by naturalism (ie. P&gt;0). But, if we assume that Durston's figures are correct, I think we would arrive at a P value that is extremely small, that even if you were to consider trillions of earth-like environments, the p-value would still be indistinguishable from 0.</div></div><hr />

Hovind tests the null hypothesis that the Bible's claim that the earth is 6000 years old is true. On his website, he lists dozens of items that he says supports this null hypothesis. (Usually by saying, that with such and such, the earth cannot be more than, say 15,000 years). His constraints do not say that the earth is specifically 6000 years old, but rather that 6000 years falls into certain narrow range of possible ages. Anyway, I don't have much interest in defending Hovind, so this is where I stop.</div></div><hr />

This is getting into an area that is intuitive but very difficult to verbalize. Now lets suppose that there are around a centillion^centillion number of earth like planets. I still don't think p is indistinguishable from 0. Now I suppose you could say that there are an infinite number of universes with an infinite number of earth-like planets, and hence no matter how small the p-value is, as long as it &amp;lt;&amp;gt;0, it is 100% probable that there are an infinite number of earth-like planets with sentient life. There's an infinite number even if the concentration is super low. Well, I have no rebuttal for that, except that I think that there is a finite number of earth-like planets. <br />
<br />
But this brings me to another consideration, one dealing with individual consciousness. What is the probability that you or me would exist anywhere, anytime? Why are you in you? Why are you self-aware? What physical property gives individuality? What is the limit to the number of individuals that can exist, anywhere, anytime? I don't think there is a limit. There are an infinite number of possible individuals, and of a higher order than the number of earth-like people on earth-like planets. What is the answer to (x/x^n) when x-&amp;gt;infinity and n&amp;gt;1. The answer is 0. I think this fact, though mathematically complicated, is intuitive to many people.</div></div><hr />

Given a large set of related low-probability outcomes, one very low probability event MUST occur.  Imagine a die with 1,000,000 sides.  Each side has 1 millionth of a chance, but roll that die and an outcome occurs nonetheless.But that outcome doesn't produce sentient life. It doesn't produce anything meaningful. Develop a distribution of those 1,000,000 sides in rank of meaning. It is unlikely that you are to randomly roll the most meaningful event.</div></div><hr />

Durston claims that the maximum limit for information is 72 bits. The most that has ever been observed is 32 bits. The number of bits required to form life, is astronomically higher than 72 bits. I realize that this doesn't necessarily mean that a natural process of higher than 72 bits is impossible, but the number of precedent zeroes is extremely high. The refutation of this argument offered was regarding the numerator (the number of earth-like planets), and hypothetically accepts Durston's claim. We are not dealing with probabilities of something happening over a few seconds (in which case the numerator is substantially high), but over billions of years (creating a numerator of one).</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for your next post to me...<br />
<br />
1.  What is this limitation on bits?  Source explaining this please.  Because I think that proteins did form naturally, I would expect that the limitation on the number of bits to be false, but I'm interested in knowing more.<br />
2.  Probability rules do not change from one example to another. Fit my comments into the problem you are having - the answer will not be different.  Very improbable &amp;lt;&amp;gt; impossible.  Increasing the number of planets may move the probability lower, but I don't feel the need to, since it doesn't matter how small the probability is... having a non-zero probability means that it is possible.  And us being here shows that the probability is non-zero.</div></div><hr />

I think it is appropriate to consider any possible events that are more meaningful than our current existence. For analogy purposes, Mulan limited the number of cominations to 1,000,000, which is significantly less than reality, so I also chose a numerator (ie. 1) that was significantly less than reality. If she would have chosen centillion^(centillion^centillion), then I may have chosen 2 as my numerator.</div></div><hr />

Here's the part that anti-evolutionists need to think about: Once the first self-replicating molecule exists, however that happens, very sson the population of self-replicating molecules will increase exponentially. Very soon there will be trillions of self-replicating molecules. Now, even if the probability of any single molecule becoming more complex and better at replicating is one in a billion, you've got a trillion dice. The odds are very good that a more advanced molecule will mutate. Now this molecule will grow exponentially. And so on and so on.<br />
<br />
So each step in evolution has a small p value, but the N is &gt;&gt; 1/p so evolution marches onward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is aside from ID theory. I think we can observe characteristics about God through the natural sciences. For example, if science shows us conclusively and consistently that the universe (time, space, matter, and energy) had a beginning, we can deduce that:<br />
1)The universe had a cause<br />
2)The cause must be outside of time, space, matter, and energy.<br />
<br />
Now I didn't throw in all the gaps in logic between these two points, but I think it is highly evident. <br />
<br />
Anyway, they are just a few characteristics. We would also know from simple logic that the Creator is very intelligent and powerful, at least relative to our standards.<br />
<br />
Going deeper than this can get pretty detailed. I would go on talking about miracles, how to evaluate them, and what possible conclusions one could make by them. We could study futuristic prophecies by various systems of belief, and see which one if any holds strong.</div></div><hr />

Imagine a die with 1,000,000 sides.  Each side has 1 millionth of a chance, but roll that die and an outcome occurs nonetheless.But that outcome doesn't produce sentient life. It doesn't produce anything meaningful. Develop a distribution of those 1,000,000 sides in rank of meaning. It is unlikely that you are to randomly roll the most meaningful event.<br />
Here's the part that anti-evolutionists need to think about: Once the first self-replicating molecule exists, however that happens, very sson the population of self-replicating molecules will increase exponentially. Very soon there will be trillions of self-replicating molecules. Now, even if the probability of any single molecule becoming more complex and better at replicating is one in a billion, you've got a trillion dice. The odds are very good that a more advanced molecule will mutate. Now this molecule will grow exponentially. And so on and so on.<br />

So each step in evolution has a small p value, but the N is &gt;&gt; 1/p so evolution marches onward. Sorry for not responding earlier. I would dispute this last part about N being &gt; 1/p. It's difficult to have this discussion without knowing what the actual p values are. Also we need to consider survival probabilities, and whether the change is significant enough for natural selection to promote the species. Previously we were talking about probabilites given information provided by Kirk Durston. I don't see how any meaningful p-value can be derived given his theorems are true. I'm not saying that his theorems are true, but our prior discussion was based on his premises. If we aren't assuming his premises, then we won't find a satisfactory resolution to our debate.

Excellent idea.  I also think you are wrong.  Almost all the &quot;paradoxes&quot; have been explained.  There are even fossils of creatures with not-quite-wings and &quot;protocells&quot; have been manufactured out of ordinary inorganic stuff and electricity.  But we've been there.  And we've certainly discussed the nature of god (or lack thereof) to death.  I was sort of curious to hear what the ID people have to say about intelligent design.<br />
<br />
By the way, it's fairly common for scientists to believe that God created the world, and created evolution as a mechanism to build the life we see today.  There isn't any obvious contradiction between a belief in a divine creator and evolutionary theory.  The bible even gets the order of creation pretty close to what evolutionary scientists would believe, and if you accept that a &quot;day&quot; during creation might be different than a &quot;day&quot; right now, there aren't that many contradictions between the biblical story and the evolutionary story.<br />

I agree entirely. I have never understood why some people think that religion and Evolution are contradictory. For a short period of my life, I rejected religion, but I never rejected evolution as a reasonable theory, and I have never believed the two were in conflict, let alone incompatible.<br />
I also see no conflict between the concepts of Evolution and Intelligent Design.<br />
<br />
I once read an excellent book about Genesis by a physicist (who, incidentally is an Orthodox Jew and is apparently also expert in the ancient scrolls) that basically says that Genesis gives a pretty good cosmological description of the birth of the Universe in terms that ancient lay people could understand. <br />

<br />
Well, the theory of evolution is a corner stone of the non-believers system.  That's the type of things that sets apart believers from non-believers.  And, that's how the universe generally works.<br />
<br />
Here's the order the universe: designs/God are the products of human brains, human brains are the products of the universe.  ID is totally backward.<br />
<br />
We should know this by now, nature never works around how humans think.  The universe exists does not need a human reason, not from the love/hate of God, nor from human sins.  I mean, what sins could dinosaurs possibly commit to cause them to distinct? The same thing can happen to humans(and all lives on earth, intelligent or otherwise) too, all it takes is some large space rocks hit the earth (no need human sins).  <br />
<br />
There might be something out there in the universe that are equally (may be even more) astonishing than human brains, we just have no ideas.</div></div><hr />

I also see no conflict between the concepts of Evolution and Intelligent Design.<br />
I will tell you what I think the issue is. <br />
First, as background, I will say right off the bat that I recently heard Richard Dawkins, who writes a lot about evolution, say that when he learned about evolution, it erased/replaced his religious faith entirely.  I don't know how slow the process was though, or the details.<br />
I will say that my own opinion is that an underappreciated element in the process of evolution is randomness, and a person who truly comes to understand how evolution has happened up to now will see this randomness.  There is a very simple exhibit at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry (maybe someone else can confirm that it's still there, or not at at the Field), which is approximately like the length of a basketball court or some very large room.  All it is is a line depicting the passage of time, with birth of the earth at one end, and the appearance of the first trilobyte (or some such thing) at the other.  Beyond that point by one or two inches is the 20th century.  Meaning that the development of nearly all animal life including the entire life of mankind, is contained in that tiny snippet, with a whole basketball-court-length's worth of randomly started and failed and started again and ever so slowly progressing primordial experiments building up to that crude little life form.  The acceleration in development that followed it may be easier to imagine as having been guided with some mission, or by some intelligent mind, but maybe it was just the acceleration we see in other kinds of developments, like technology -- and what of the ridiculous wait beforehand?<br />
This may not be a good example, but people studying evolution are constantly coming up against the randomness with which it has moved &quot;forward&quot;, and for some people this randomness is so overwhelming that it is incompatible with a) our conception of God and b) the idea of a consciously guided plan.<br />
<br />
There are other things that can be connected with the study of evolution that are incompatible with conventional religious ideas -- like much of what one learns in the social sciences.  My opinion is that the more one learns of them, the more likely one's traditional religious ideas are to slowly drop away.  (For example, the things a person learns about neuroscience and the brain are likely to be incompatible with the notion that a person is a body that contains a single, unified soul.)  The more exposure one has to them, the more challenges are presented to one's traditional religious faith.  That is why what you say about scientists is truer of the hard sciences than of the social sciences.  The hard sciences present less of a challenge in general to religious ideas than do the social sciences, imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's give this a try.<br />
<br />
I suppose that I might be the only one in support of ID research, and I'm not even well-read in the subject. I would prefer to discuss topics like whether Hezekiah can be considered a type of Christ, or the nature of double and triple fulfillment of Biblical prophecies. But, I don't think I would have many listeners if I talked about that issue, and the issues involved within it. Well maybe a few, and we do get into them sometimes. <br />
<br />
The problem with the discussion so far is that Intelligent Design is often misrepresented, and misunderstood. It's not really a difficult position to grasp, but rather people have these other concepts stuck in their heads that they cannot detach from Intelligent Design theory. For example, many of the posts in the last page or so said that ID is opposed to evolution. It is not. Many people who are proponents of ID are evolutionists. Many are not. Also ID&amp;lt;&amp;gt;Young Earth Creationism. Also, people think that the attributes of an intelligent designer is related to ID theory. It isn't, more often than not. ID is often criticized because it is such a general theory, and because it makes very few presuppositions. The age of the earth, for example, is a non-issue for ID. ID is workable theory within an evolutionary framework, a progressive creationist framework and a young-earth framework (amongst others). It doesn't rise or fall if the earth is young or old. It doesn't rise or fall if evolution occurred or not. It doesn't reject the possibility that God created humans through a process of evolution. ID doesn't answer questions such as why such a designer would permit evil and suffering. That's a theological question, and does not involve an answer by us researching nature. ID is not a Bible based theory. Certainly many ID proponents believe the Bible as God's Word. Again there will be the temptation to bring the Bible into the discussion, but it isn't a part of ID theory. ID is a general theory that suggests the evidence points towards an intelligent designer that is responsible for creating the universe and life itself. Is this clear? One thing ID is opposed to, is evolution without God's intervention in the process. This is highly controversial, and the focus of most discussion dealing with ID theory.<br />
<br />
Now as Melanie pointed out (and I enjoyed reading her posts), part of the difficulty Christians and the like have difficulty with naturalistic evolution, is that it effectively takes God out of the picture. Our faith is built around the premise that God created the universe, that God created plants, animals, and set humans apart, that we are special, that God created the universe for the benefit of humans. If humans are just an accidental consequence of nature without the involvement of God, what are we then? What value are we? Is God indifferent to our existence? Clearly there is a threat to Christian faith at hand here. (I talk about Christian faith here aside from Intelligent Design Theory.) Without the involvement of God in the making of human beings, we are all living meaningless lives with no higher purpose other than our own survival and personal gratification. I'm not saying this to offend anyone. It is my personal opinion, which I have given significant thought towards.<br />

What is clear to me is that your statement shows that ID is probably more suited to a social science or religion classroom, as opposed to a science classroom.

MS, certainly what you wrote does not offend ME.  But I would disagree slightly.  I am one of those people who believe that life has no purpose.  I would not even call survival or personal gratification a purpose.  But I absolutely do believe that the fact of being alive confers upon us certain obligations, as well as rights/entitlements.</div></div><hr />

I can't seem to make a distinction between the general theory of evolution and ID theory in this regard. Evolution fits different pieces of scientific evidence into a theory. ID does the same. Oftentimes, it is the same evidence that is used in both theories. So to say ID is non-scientific is also to say evolution is non-scientific. In addition, many high schools don't teach religion (mine didn't), and doing so may mislead people into thinking such beliefs of an intelligent designer are based on ignorance rather than research and analysis. Perhaps ID could fit into ancient history class, I wouldn't disagree with that. But, i wouldn't limit it there.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I'm not even sure myself if I would prefer ID to be taught in public schools. I think it should be optional for teachers. I wouldn't want some hard-core narrow-minded atheist teacher teaching my kids about ID, if he isn't going to give it a fair analysis in the classroom. I also think that teachers shouldn't be required to teach macro-evolution as absolute fact, though I still think it should be taught.</div></div><hr />

I think we talked about this subject before. It's one of my favorites. <br />
<br />
Now, if our purpose is due to the fact that evolution programmed us such and such a way (supposedly for bettering survival chances), then this in-built sense of obligation, rights, entitlements, etc. are there for exactly that purpose, survival of our human species. How else did it come about that we have these in-built senses? I'm not saying you must believe this or that, but I do wonder how these senses came into us, and should be of high consideration.<br />

that the obligations and rights simply exist because we do, propagation of humanity be d***ed.  If they are rooted in anything more than that, then it is in the fact that we suffer.

I appreciate your opinions and have a question for you (or anyone else with similar opinions).  Would a God that indirectly created humans through the creation of the Universe be a problem for you faith?  For instance, if you found out the God's only direct involvement in creation was to create the big bang (or cause an event that eventually lead to the big bang) be a problem for you faith?<br />

If intelligent life were found elsewhere, we could still say they were intelligently desgined by God. However, this would seem to contradict the Bible's claim that the universe was created for humankind.</div></div><hr />

In a sense, God's creative acts are completed, and thus the only prediction would be that there will be no more creative acts. <br />

As far as the question regarding ID being science, some parts of it are and some parts if it aren't, and this is somewhat dependent on how truth is defined.

Perhaps I'm mistaken in some form or another. I'm not an expert in the living sciences, but on the other hand, I haven't been convinced yet in the distinctions made between ID and evolution regarding what is science and not. I'm not sure one could find a definition that includes all areas of evolution and no areas of ID. There's too much overlap to make this bold assertion.<br />
<br />
Regarding whether ID makes verifiable predictions depends on whether you ask the question for the theory as a whole, or would you allow for micro parts of the theory as well?

I agree that science is not all there is to truth. There are many truths that  are beyond the reach of science.  Saying that ID isn't science is not the same as saying that ID isn't true.  The science of evolution and the philosophy of ID could both be true and non-contradictory (e.g. in the case where God causes the Big Bang).<br />

I hope we can avoid double standards in our evaluation between evolution and ID.<br />
<br />
I agree that both theories should be evaluated consistantly.  Here are a few predictions of evolutionary theory that have been verified many times:<br />
<br />
1) Evolution predicted an Earth much much older than what was believed at the time of Darwin.<br />
<br />
2) Evolution predicts that all fossils of modern humans will be found in rock layers no older that about 200,000 years old.<br />
<br />
3) Evolution predicts that the fossil record will show gradual changes in species and it does (for instance the fossil record shows how whales evolved from land mammals).<br />
<br />
Since I too am not an expert in the life sciences these are just a few of the simpler predictions of evolutionary theory that have been verified.   On the other had, to the best of my knowledge ID has not made a single verified prediction. <br />
<br />
So I don't see how there is any comparison between the two theories on a scientific basis.</div></div><hr />

I don't think evolutionary theory makes any claims about the Big Bang, so a non-naturalistic cause of the Big Bang would be irrelevant to evolutionary theory.I think you are right. I was thinking in terms of God starting a chain of events starting with the big bang, and continuing through the formation of human beings. Thus, I may have misunderstood your original question.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, IMO what caused the Big Bang is probably beyond the reach of science (but science could prove me wrong on this someday).I know too little about the theory to understand potential causes. The ones that have been brought forth (among the ones I've heard argued) seem to have major philosophical/scientific issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't think that claims that a particular scientific theory is wrong is a scientific theory in and of itself. <br />
But the scientific method can be used to disprove an alternative scientific theory.<br />
<br />

I'm not sure whether using evidence of the past is legitimate in proving the validity of a theory. Particularly, these pieces of evidence, while they may be true, do not eliminate all other possible causes. The fossil record shows compatibility with gradualism, but it also seems to show compatibilty with progressive creationism and non-naturalistic theistic evolution, particularly since the advent of punctuated equilibrium. What would be more convincing is whether gradualism can be shown true over the future, and a form of gradualism that is incompatible with the alternative theistic models. (We need to be careful with applying our definitions. For example, if evolution just meant change and nothing else, than even young earth creationists would be considered evolutionists. Clearly such a definition is not helpful in resolving this debate.) <br />

<br />
Thanks for the site.  It appears to be one of the better ID site I have seen (at first galnce).<br />
<br />
Here are my initial reaction to these predictions.<br />
<br />
1) This one goes back to why I started the thread.  I do need to undersatand specified complexity better.  The examples that I have heard Behe discuss on the radio a couple times is that the cell illustrates SC since each part is crucial to the functioning of the cell and if any part is removed then the cell won't function.  An answer to this is that the different cell parts evolved together, but I will read Behe's book soon.<br />
<br />
2) Due to the spottiness of the fossil record (it is a rare event for an organism to be fossilized) we will probably always have holes in the fossil record.  But it shouldn't take too much of a leap of faith to infer from the more complete parts of the fossil record.<br />
<br />
3) I'm not sure why this would lead to a designer.  Evolution can re-use parts as well, and according to evolution there are no unrelated orgamisms.  Just some are more related than others.<br />
<br />
4) This one seems to have a lot of &quot;wiggle room.&quot;  A better prediction would be that there are NO useless &quot;junk&quot; in biology, such as vestigial organs or alleged functionless DNA.  It seems that any of this &quot;junk&quot; would imply no designer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saint Kepler</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are a few comments in response to no one in particular.  They are just some of my thoughts around the ID-evolution debate.<br />
<br />
First, many ID theorist (and creationists) point out that since science assumes naturalistic causes that this is a fundamental flaw in the process.  We have to remember that this was not always the case.  For thousands of years mankind assumed divine cause for a whole host of events from earthquakes, droughts, and diseases (societal and personal punishment from the gods) to the motion of celestial bodies (angels pushed the planets in their orbits) to mental illness (demonic possession).  One-by-one natural causes were discovered for each one of these events through the scientific process.  With the success of discovering natural causes and the failures of previously held divine causes is makes perfect sense (to me) that science would have natural cause as a default and would need a lot of evidence to the contrary to deviate from that.<br />
<br />
Second, some ID theorists (and creationists) try to frame the ID-evolution debate as a debate between theism and atheism.  This is simply not true.  Most vast majority of people (including scientists) that accept evolution believe in God.  The Pope accepts evolution and I don't think anyone would accuse him of only supporting evolution to further the cause of atheism.  It's true that there are a few atheists that latch on to evolution because to them it proves that God is unnecessary, but this is by far a minority position.<br />
<br />
Third, it seems strange that so many people that know very little about science (not referring to anyone in particular on this board) are so confident that evolution is wrong.  Considering the success that science has had I would think that people would have more faith in the process.  BTW this doesn't mean that I don't think people shouldn't question science.<br />
<br />
Finally in response to people that think that ID should be taught as science in school science classes, even if we assume that ID is a valid scientific theory the fact remains that it has very little support in the scientific community.  I am not aware of any scientific association that accepts ID as a valid alternative to evolution.  With the lack of support from the scientific community I cannot see how ID can be given serious consideration for school curriculums.  To me this is like teaching about UFOs.  Even though a lot of people believe it is true (including some scientists) there is insufficient expert support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oliver Klozov</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a little irony that the Big Bang is being thrown around this thread like an absolute fact?  The Big Bang is taught in schools, much as is Evolution, as the leading theory.  However, there is considerable debate about the validity of the theory in the world of astrophysics.  With respect to this thread there is another ironic twist....some scientists beleive that the universe must be older than 20 billion years...they feel that super clusters of galaxies would require in the order of 100-150 billion years to form.<br />

<br />
<br />
Why would newly discovered evidence of the past be invalid for testing a scientific theory?<br />
<br />
It's not invalid. The fulfilled predictions don't prove the theory, but it establishes credibility for the theory. I was just pointing out that some of the evidence presented is consistent with other theistic theories of origins, and that theories are better established with observations of things that are on-going.<br />

3) I'm not sure why this would lead to a designer.  Evolution can re-use parts as well, and according to evolution there are no unrelated orgamisms.  Just some are more related than others. I think you are right that ID and evolution makes the same prediction here. I see it as a counter-balance to the evolutionary argument that all animal life are all so similar. This is not a complete surprise given an individual designer.<br />
<br />
4) This one seems to have a lot of &quot;wiggle room.&quot;  A better prediction would be that there are NO useless &quot;junk&quot; in biology, such as vestigial organs or alleged functionless DNA.  It seems that any of this &quot;junk&quot; would imply no designer.I think you are correct in a sense. If ID holds true, we would expect that the supposed junk will later be found useful. The appendix is one example where we are starting to better understand its usefulness. Nevertheless, many theistic origins theories involve some form of devolution, ie. through a combination of isolation of genes and natural selection, our genetic makeup is becoming less advanced. Though the appendix is quite useful to our bodies, it may have through time become more harmful than good.</div></div><hr />

The Big Bang is taught in schools, much as is Evolution, as the leading theory.  However, there is considerable debate about the validity of the theory in the world of astrophysics.  With respect to this thread there is another ironic twist....some scientists beleive that the universe must be older than 20 billion years...they feel that super clusters of galaxies would require in the order of 100-150 billion years to form.<br />
<br />
Anyway, end of the hijack.<br />
<br />
I thought one of the major finds of the last couple years was an estimate of the age of the universe at 14.something billion years give or take a couple hundred million. I've heard some debate regarding the Big Bang theory, as many scientists have noticed inconsistencies within the theory. I'm not personally qualified to have a scientific opinion on the matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul Brand</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are a few comments in response to no one in particular.  They are just some of my thoughts around the ID-evolution debate.<br />
<br />
First, many ID theorist (and creationists) point out that since science assumes naturalistic causes that this is a fundamental flaw in the process.  We have to remember that this was not always the case.  For thousands of years mankind assumed divine cause for a whole host of events from earthquakes, droughts, and diseases (societal and personal punishment from the gods) to the motion of celestial bodies (angels pushed the planets in their orbits) to mental illness (demonic possession).  One-by-one natural causes were discovered for each one of these events through the scientific process.  With the success of discovering natural causes and the failures of previously held divine causes is makes perfect sense (to me) that science would have natural cause as a default and would need a lot of evidence to the contrary to deviate from that.I partly agree. However, I think we are too strongly leaning in the naturalism side of the contiuum at the present time.<br />
<br />
Second, some ID theorists (and creationists) try to frame the ID-evolution debate as a debate between theism and atheism.  This is simply not true.  Most vast majority of people (including scientists) that accept evolution believe in God.  The Pope accepts evolution and I don't think anyone would accuse him of only supporting evolution to further the cause of atheism.  It's true that there are a few atheists that latch on to evolution because to them it proves that God is unnecessary, but this is by far a minority position.Good points.<br />
<br />
Third, it seems strange that so many people that know very little about science (not referring to anyone in particular on this board) are so confident that evolution is wrong.  Considering the success that science has had I would think that people would have more faith in the process.  BTW this doesn't mean that I don't think people shouldn't question science.Science over time, has shown that revision of theories is common, and sometimes complete overhauls are necessary. Some argue that modern day science is more accurate, but I think we still need time to establish that claim. <br />
<br />
Finally in response to people that think that ID should be taught as science in school science classes, even if we assume that ID is a valid scientific theory the fact remains that it has very little support in the scientific community.  I am not aware of any scientific association that accepts ID as a valid alternative to evolution.  With the lack of support from the scientific community I cannot see how ID can be given serious consideration for school curriculums.  To me this is like teaching about UFOs.  Even though a lot of people believe it is true (including some scientists) there is insufficient expert support.<br />
Now, I would point out that there is a lot of fear among many ID proponents and creationists regarding coming out with their personal views. Credibility can easily be lost. Also, there are a number of political forces in play that would prevent competing theories from being presented, particularly in scientific journals and schools. Throw in misunderstandings of what ID is, the fact that ID mixes religion and science together (which will necessarily create much opposition), and lack of public funding, you start to realize that there may very well be more support for ID in the scientific community than meets the eye. I would expect that if ID does make some kind of break-through, you will see many closet ID proponents come to the surface.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since when did being qualified become a pre-requisite to having an opinion?  ;)<br />
<br />
The articles that I have read on the subject refer to the multitude of additions that need to be made to the theory to allow it to match up with observation.  Cosmic Strings being one of them.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to make my point somewhat relevant to this thread....just because the Big Bang may not be &quot;correct&quot;, doesn't make it bad science.<br />
<br />
From my (admittedly simplistic) point of view, I only see ID as interjecting God into the equation.  I don't see what it adds to Evolution from a science perspective.</div></div><hr />

I think that if ID made some kind of verifiable break-through, you would see everyone scrambling to accept it.  I know people get caught up in proving themselves correct and not wanting to be wrong, but I don't know anyone who does not wish for religion to be correct and science to be wrong.<br />
Atheists don't have their beliefs because they want it that way.  Obviously it would be preferable to have everlasting life instead of fading into nothingness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be clear, I wasn't referring to scientific breakthroughs in ID, but political ones. If you take away the fear factor, more ID proponents will come out of the closet. I am talking about those who have previously been ID proponents but would never say so publicly. I am not talking about new converts to the theory.</div></div><hr />

The harm done to their respective families may be greater than the benefit of adding a single voice to the cause. There will be some variance in how people evaluate the costs/benefits of coming out of the closet.<br />
<br />
My point is that people who believe in evolution do not do so as a way to be against religion.  Some do, some don't, imo. I think everyone would love to have something that proves to them that religion is correct. There are consequences that some people are not willing to accept when putting their faith in God.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saint Kepler</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PB, I have a philosophical question for you on ID.  I know ID theory in general makes no statement on who the designer is, but I believe that your personal belief is that the designer is God.<br />
<br />
Do you see clear evidence of design in the fossil record?<br />
<br />
My view is that if life was designed then the fossil record shows the designer to be a flawed intelligence, not an all-knowing all-powerful deity.<br />
<br />
For instance, why would God waste so much time with early reptiles and then dinosaurs?  Even when he does get to mammals and humans there is no direct path to us.  There are many lines of human evolution with all but one (our line) ending in extinction.  With all of the extinctions (mass and gradual) and lineage deadends the process seems to be inefficient and haphazard.</div></div><hr />

I am a moderately conservative evangelical Christian.<br />
<br />
Do you see clear evidence of design in the fossil record?I don't look to the fossil record in terms of evidence of design. Bones can only tell you so much about their sophistication. I would look at simple things, such as the advantages of feeling pain when your body is being harmed. Sure, evolutionary theory has an explanation for how pain receptors come about, but honestly, the precision and creativitiy required for this would lead me to believe that it is God behind it all and not natural evolutionary forces. I mean, I could go on to thousands of examples of this sort of thing, but that would be tiresome. To me, it is self-evident that something beyond nature is involved. Now, that won't help anyone who doesn't share the same intuition of things, but I'm speaking personally. I grew up in a liberal, universalist Christian home and other than praying before eating and sleeping, Christian faith was absent from our daily lives. Nevertheless, my life experience, even as a child seemed to demonstrate the existence of God. I'm overwhelmed by the sophistication in nature. This may seem to be the view of an uneducated individual, but the more I learn about nature, the more I realize how sophisticated this universe is. I question things now that I believed growing up, but in general my beliefs about the existence of God is unchanged. When the evolutionist cites our understanding of the genome as evidence that things aren't as complex as they seem, I look at the same evidence and see marvelous sophistication beyond what I originally thought. <br />

I'm sure &quot;Reasons to Believe&quot; (www.reasons.org) would provide answers to these questions. I've got some ideas, but I'll have to pass for now as I've got to go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me, the clincher in this regard is my own existence.  By this, I don't mean my physical existence, but my self/being/consciousness/awareness/soul/whateveryouwanttocallit.  Let's say for the moment that pure scientific determinism can account for every feature of every creature in the world, and even for everything about my own body.  That still would explain how &quot;I&quot; (self/being/...) experience what is happening to this body.  It wouldn't explain how &quot;I&quot; got inside of this machine made out of meat.  Call me conceited, but I just don't see how &quot;I&quot; could have been created without a Creator.<br />
<br />
Once this has been established, the rest is filling in the details - very interesting ones in many cases, but still just details.  From what I've seen, the theory of evolution as commonly understood (or something more-or-less like it) does a pretty good job of explaining many of these details.  But, I know that in the background there's a Big Something that evolution just doesn't have anything to say about.</div></div><hr />

This sounds similar to my brother-in-law.  He believes that the human body evolved, but that the human mind did not and was a direct creation of God.  An interesting position.<br />
<br />
One counterpoint would be grades of intelligence in the animal world.  Chimps are pretty intelligent compared to other animals.  Do they have a lesser soul or have they just reached a biological limit and would need a soul to evolve more intelligence.  Interesting questions.<br />
<br />
BTW, you are conceited.   :)</div></div><hr />

I do understand this position.  I was there at one point.  I grew up as Roman Catholic, but outside of going to church and CCD there was very little discussion of God and even less of science in my family (and not much science at school either).<br />
<br />
As a young adult on my own I began to lose faith at the same time as I was learning about science.  I wasn't losing faith because of science and for a time science was helping me keep faith.  At this point I was an ID adherent to some extent (philosophically, not scientifically).  I believed that God created the laws of nature and set the initial conditions of the Universe (by creating the Big Bang).  I believed that His direct involvement in the evolution of the Universe ended there.  So for me there was no conflict between faith and science.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turpin</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I can tell, alleged evidence for creation usually falls into one of three categories:<br />
<br />
(a) Evidence that the Universe as a whole is optimized for life.<br />
<br />
(b) Evidence that biological evolution of human beings was either impossible or somehow assisted by intelligent beings.<br />
<br />
(c) Evidence that the Earth or Universe is young, verifying a Biblical account.<br />
<br />
Category (a) can be explained by observing that the Universe is also optimized for creation of a certain category of black holes, each of which may cause the creation of another Universe.  Intelligent life can be viewed as a further optimization, an addition to the reproductive machinery of the Universe.  This also explains what happened before the &quot;Big Bang&quot;.<br />
<br />
Category (b) is more simply explained by interference from extraterrestrials, possibly even beings from the parent Universe who have figured out how to penetrate supposed event horizons.  <br />
<br />
Category (c) is usually either old science that has been disproven, or junk science.<br />
<br />
I do not mean to say that any of the evidence for Creationism proves anything, just that even if it does, it does not prove that Monotheistic religions are correct.<br />
<br />
Also, considering that the Bible only has a brief description of creation, and that there are entire books of prophecy in the Bible about historical events, I think that more convincing evidence for the Bible would be found by studying written history.  At least, if you believe in the Bible and the scientific method, you ought to concentrate on the bulk of testable evidence rather than one brief passage that has only been poorly translated into English.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed the origin of consciousness is a profound enigma.  However, to explain it with a Creator just replaces one enigma with another (how did the Creator originate and obtain such powers?).<br />
<br />
Maybe consciousness is like magnetism, in that it is an &quot;invisible force&quot; that permeates the universe, and any material can carry it to at least a miniscule degree, but some carry it better than others.<br />
<br />
And much like a piece of iron that becomes magnetized when an electrical current is passed through it in a certain way, consciousness may be something that naturally forms when electrical currents are passed through the appropriate materials (in our case, neurons) which have been organized in a manner conducive to consciousness.  The nature and structure of the materials and currents would determine the number of &quot;selfs&quot; and the degree of consciousness (e.g. fish &amp;lt; dog &amp;lt; chimp &amp;lt; human).<br />
<br />
I am definitely not claiming to solve the riddle of the self; I am just pointing out that there are other explanations that don't require a Creator.</div></div><hr />
