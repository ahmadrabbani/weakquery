<h1>More Comments on ID and Religion-Science</h1>
<p>Below are some comments I made to two of my brothers who included me in their
  discussions on Intelligent Design. They  have formal theology training (one
  has a Masters in systematic theology from Pacific School of Religion and another
  has a Master of Divinity from Candler Seminary and is working on a PhD through
  Oxford) while my formal training is in science. One brother is in favor of
  Intelligent Design and <a href="diplomatic-medium.htm">the other sees problems
  with it theologically</a>. Both
  are deeply devoted, spiritual Christians and they are also very careful, clear
  thinkers. The fact that these two brothers who love each other and who have
  given much
  thought to the theological implications of Intelligent Design can arrive at
  two different positions on this issue shows that the gulf or divide between
  the &quot;two sides&quot; of the debate is not as wide or stark as often described
  by some vocal advocates: rational intellect vs. out-of-date superstition or
  atheistic
  secularist
  forces of Satan vs. God-loving forces of light and truth (and some other more
  vitriolic descriptions I won't repeat here).</p>
<p>Again, as I noted in <a href="../why-not-ID.htm">my other article</a>,  I
  am presenting this as my personal views and not as astronomy fact or scientific
  theory like
  all of the rest of the material on the Astronomy Notes
site. Also, these comments are just the beginning stages of explanation or exploration
  of the ideas presented here.</p>
<h3>God Creating Through Evolution</h3>
<p>I see God creating life forms through the process of evolution. A biblical
  faith sees nature as governed by God. With this biblical view, evolution is
  the hand of God at work in His world. Natural events are the ways in which
  God accomplishes his purposes in nature. There is no necessary tie between
the processes of evolution and atheism. <em>[Father George Coyne, director of
the Vatican Observatory, <a href="http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=18540" target="outside">agrees
in a recent article</a> and over <a href="http://www.uwosh.edu/colleges/cols/religion_science_collaboration.htm" target="outside">10,000
Christian clergy across the nation agree</a>: &quot;For far too long, strident
voices,
in
the name of Christianity, have been claiming that people must choose between
religion
and modern science ... this is a false dichotomy.&quot; (<a href="http://www.uwosh.edu/colleges/cols/clergy_project.htm" target="outside">Clergy
Letter Project</a>, Feb.
12, 2006)]</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, &quot;evolution&quot; has come to mean in many people's eyes
  the whole materialistic <em>method</em> <em><strong>plus</strong></em> the
  philosophy which says nature is autonomous and there is no God and there is
  no purpose to creation, much
  less to our lives.
  A materialistic faith sees nature as a great machine&#8212;autonomous. Some vocal
  biologists hold to a materialistic faith while other biologists hold to the
biblical faith mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p>
<h3>Vast Diversity of Life Plausible to This Astronomer</h3>
<p>As an astronomer I am amazed at all that can be created with the simple inverse
  square law of nature called gravity. When one sees all of the intricate structure
  in Saturn's rings (density waves, resonance gaps, etc. created by small moons
  pulling on the fist-sized ring particles and all the amazing things we're still
  discovering about how gravity operates from the Cassini spacecraft now at Saturn)
  or the variety of shapes created by colliding galaxies or the sheer beauty
  of a gorgeous spiral galaxy, I don't think it so far-fetched that the process
of evolution can create such diversity and complexity in the biological realm.</p>
<p>I'm not a biologist, so my understanding of evolution is a bit limited, but
  I do understand that it is a bit more complicated than Newton's law of gravity.
  Therefore, I'm not surprised that such complexity and diversity of animals
  can arise from evolutionary processes and changes in the DNA molecule. A bacteria's
  DNA contains around 4<sup>4,700,000</sup> possible blueprints (that's 4 raised to the
  power 4.7 million or about &quot;1&quot; followed by a million zeroes). Evolution
  talks about creating new genetic combinations from that huge probability space.
  It does not talk about where the probability space came from. Mammal-primate-human
DNA is a bit more than a bacteria's DNA.</p>
<p><em><strong>Updated fall 2007:</strong> </em>Critics of darwinian evolution often quote mind-boggling
  numbers like I do in the previous paragraph to show that natural origins (not
  supernatural) are simply so statistically IMprobable that one must conclude
  that a purely natural origin to life is impossible. The critics have committed
  one or more of the following errors described by Ian Musgrave in his article
  on the TalkOrigins Archive &quot;<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/abioprob.html" target="outside">Lies,
  Damned Lies, Statistics, and Probability of Abiogenesis Calculations</a>&quot; (link
  will appear in a new window):</p>
<ol>
  <li>They calculate the probability of the formation of a &quot;modern&quot; protein,
    or even a complete bacterium with all &quot;modern&quot; proteins, by random
  events. This is not the abiogenesis theory at all.</li>
  <li>They assume that there
      is a fixed number of proteins, with fixed sequences for each protein, that
    are required for life.</li>
  <li>They calculate the probability of sequential trials,
      rather than simultaneous trials.</li>
  <li>They misunderstand what is meant by a probability
      calculation.</li>
  <li>They seriously underestimate the number of functional enzymes/ribozymes
          present in a group of random sequences.</li>
</ol>
<p>See Musgrave's article for the explanation behind each of these errors. <a href="statistics-article/abioprob.html">Local
  copy</a> (in case TalkOrigins has moved the article).</p>
<h3>Science as Tool to Understanding the &quot;How&quot; of Universe</h3>
<p>It is okay to use science as a tool in understanding the physical world that
  God has created (is still creating) while still viewing God as the author of
  creation. The tool assumes that everything that happens is the result of natural
  forces/processes without some sort of supernatural &quot;God action&quot;.
  In order to use the tool of science I need to keep my focus which means that
  I won't be looking for a purpose or &quot;design&quot; of what I am observing.
  Science cannot tell the purpose or meaning of creation. For Christians + Jews,
the Bible does that. For other religious faiths, their sacred texts or traditions
  do that.</p>
<p>Keeping focussed in order to wield the tool properly takes a lot of practice
  and I'd prefer the high school and lower division science classes stick to
  a purely, narrowly defined science curriculum without bringing purpose/God
  into the mix. The students will get the purpose-meaning from family and other
places outside that brief 50 minutes/day of the science class.</p>
<p>I'm a <em>methodological</em> materialist when doing science like Gregor Mendel
  (Austrian monk often called the &quot;father of genetics&quot;) and Georges Lemaitre
  (Belgian Roman
  Catholic priest who was the first one to use General Relativity to describe
  what would become the Big Bang theory) and the Vatican astronomers but I'm
  <strong>not</strong> a
<em>philosophical</em> materialist who believes that the material world is ALL
that exists&#8212;no God.</p>
<h3>Intelligent Design as a &quot;Dead-End&quot; to Understanding the Universe</h3>
<p>I personally see ID in science as a cop-out and a dead-end to deepening our
  understanding of the natural world. Because we don't understand something fully
  yet, doesn't mean we should throw up our hands and say that &quot;God did it&quot; and
  leave it at that&#8212;end of inquiry. Using the tool of science we look for explanations
  as if some God-action/miracle was not present. It is fine for ID advocates
  to point out that the known natural processes cannot produce some physical
  event or creature, but that just means we don't know all of the natural processes
  yet or fully the understand the natural processes that have been discovered.
  We can't say that proves that a God-action happened. (Neither can we say that
  the God-action did not happen.) I will use science's materialist assumption
  to find out more about the creation authored by God. Using that materialist
  assumption while applying the tool of science has actually led me to a greater
  appreciation for the artistry that surrounds us. But that appreciation for
  the artistry comes from my religious roots and I recognize that it is not a
necessary result of scientific study.</p>
<h3>Intelligent Design as Replacement for Evolution</h3>
<p> Intelligent Design (ID) folks are wanting to <em>replace</em> evolution with
  ID as a valid science theory. The process of evolution including natural selection
  has been
  so well
  tested
  that is now considered a &quot;law&quot; of nature. ID as a science theory
  comes no where even close. Not teaching about evolution is very dangerous for
  our physical (medical) health as well as the health of our environment (God's
  creation). Evolution with natural selection is vital to our understanding of
  how viruses and bacteria change or adapt to our attempts to eradicate them
  with excessive, improper applications of antibiotics or how they spread in
  an increasingly
mobile population across the globe. </p>
<p>Most ID folks lump evolution in with philosophical materialism
  and therefore, anyone
  supporting
  evolution
  is
  an
  atheist. So there
  is now a
  false
  dichotomy: we have to choose between &quot;naturalism&quot; (philosophical
  materialism) and &quot;supernaturalism&quot; (God) without the biblical view
that God operates within nature.</p>
<h3>Intelligent Design Advocates ARE Trying to Prove a Personal God</h3>
<p>Intelligent Design (ID) folks are definitely trying to prove that God exists
  and that God is personal. They use science to do that to get &quot;objective&quot; proof
  of God. The school board members in my city certainly want to prove to the
  kids that God exists and then make the leap to the Christian/Jewish personal
  God. If they can prove God exists, then that will necessarily lead (they believe)
  to the personal God talked about in the Bible since that God is the only one
  known (or the very predominant one). Finally, it will be the God as viewed
  through a particular theological understanding of the Bible. They want to get
  rid of evolution because that will necessarily (they think) lead people to
  believe in their young-earth (usually) creationist view of God. (This is the
  &quot;two models idea&quot; described near the end of <a href="../why-not-ID.htm">my
  other article</a>.)</p>
<p>In Bakersfield, the school board members arguing for ID are fundamentalist
  literalists clergy of some local churches. One has said that all non-Christians
  will go to Hell, all atheists (his definition of atheists) are perverts, and
the Earth and universe were created in six 24-hour days. Now of course we
  shouldn't lump all Intelligent Design folks in with these particular views,
  but a great many ID advocates  do see this as a battle between good and evil
  in a world that has gone seriously astray. The goal of the Discovery Institute's
  Center for Renewal of Science and Culture (now called &quot;Center for Science and
  Culture) as stated by its director several years ago is to promote Christian
  theism and the &quot;overthrow of materialism and its damning cultural
  legacies.&quot; </p><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">

                    </script>
<p>When I was in grad school at the University of Washington, I went to a talk
  at the church I attended given by a physicist named Hugh Ross (&quot;Reasons
  to Believe&quot;)
  who said that the Big Bang was proof that there was a beginning as described
  in Genesis
  and that necessarily meant that God was the spark. In the next sentence he
  said that this also showed that God is personal and is the one described in
  the Bible. That was a big leap in logic. People DO try to prove God exists
  using science and those that do are very popular to a large segment of our
population (they are making lots of money).</p>
<h3>Science: Interpretation of Nature. Theology: Interpretation of Scripture</h3>
<p>David Wilcox in his recent book &quot;God and Evolution: A Faith-Based Understanding&quot; (2004.
  Valley Forge, PA: Judson Press) gives a helpful distinction between fact and
  interpretation and where science and theology
  fall in that. He writes that science is the human understanding of nature.
  While nature cannot be in error, science (and scientists) can certainly be
  in error. Science is not nature itself. Along the same lines, theology is the
  human understanding of Scripture. While the Bible cannot be in error, theology
  (and
  theologians)
  can
  indeed be
  in error. &quot;Theology is not Scripture itself. Like science, it is not absolute
  truth. It is prone to error.&quot; (p. 13) A conflict of nature and the Bible is
  actually a result of our flawed understanding of one or both. </p>
<p>He also advises
    scientists and theologians to not accept what they encounter at face value---a
    &quot;literal&quot; meaning (a seemingly obvious meaning derived from a first impression).
  While a scientist or theologian might end up accepting a literal meaning of
  a phenomena
  of nature
  or Scripture
  reading,
  a first impression should not &quot;limit further exploration.&quot; (p. 14) After discussing
  what &quot;the twelve tribes of Israel&quot; means (there were actually 13), he says,
  &quot;...it is possible for the perceived &quot;literal&quot; or face-value meaning of Scripture
  to shield us from understanding it true theological meaning.&quot; (p. 15) This
  is the same view as Marcus Borg's &quot;more than literal meaning&quot; discussion I
  use in my <a href="truth-metaphor.htm">&quot;The Truth of the Bible Is Metaphorical&quot;
  article</a>. </p>
<h3>Other Articles on Intelligent Design + Religion - Science</h3>
<ol>
  <li>&quot;<a href="../why-not-ID.htm">Why not teach Intelligent Design in our
    schools? A passionate look at the controversy.</a>&quot; This is the &quot;my other
    article&quot; I mention above. It also contains links to evidence for an old Earth&#8211;old
    universe in my Astronomy Notes online textbook.</li>
  <li>&quot;<a href="truth-metaphor.htm">The Truth of the Bible Is Metaphorical</a>.&quot; A way of reading this sacred
    text for its &quot;more than literal&quot; meaning that is not inferior to a literalist
    view. As Charles Kimball states in his book &quot;When Religion Becomes Evil&quot;,
    I take the Bible too seriously to read it literally.</li>
  <li>&quot;<a href="diplomatic-medium.htm">Some Troubles of Intelligent Design:
      A Look at the Culture Battle Between Science and Religion</a>&quot; by
      Brett Strobel, one of the brothers I talk about in the introduction. He
      discusses the philosophical roots of Intelligent Design, the search for
      truth and science's vs. religion's sense of &quot;truth&quot;, and the theological
