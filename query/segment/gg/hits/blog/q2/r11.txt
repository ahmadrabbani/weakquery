In an opinion piece published by Reuters on Sunday, Summers -- a Harvard professor and former Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton -- argued that it would be "premature'' to withdraw fiscal support for the economy at the end of 2011. Summers' comments come as Republican and Democratic lawmakers debate ways to reduce the U.S. deficit and as his former colleagues in President Barack Obama's administration mull a temporary cut in payroll taxes for employers. Summers said the United States might have faced a double-dip recession if Obama had not agreed to a deal last year with congressional Republicans to extend unemployment insurance benefits and payroll tax cuts for workers. The deal was part of a wider package that included an extension of Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. "Fiscal support should be continued and indeed expanded by providing the payroll tax cut to employers as well as employees,'' Summers wrote.  "Raising the share of the payroll tax cut from 2 percent to 3 percent would be desirable as well.'' He said such moves could cost a little over $200 billion. "These measures offer the prospect of significant improvement in economic performance over the next few years translating into significant increases in the tax base and reductions in necessary government outlays,'' he said. Summers, who was one of Obama's top economic advisers for the first two years of the president's administration, said that the "greatest threat'' to U.S. creditworthiness was a sustained period of slow growth. "This means that essential discussions about medium-term measures to restrain spending and raise revenues need to be coupled with a focus on near-term growth,'' Summers wrote. "Substantial withdrawal of fiscal support for demand at the end of 2011 would be premature.'' He also said the Obama administration could do more to promote tourism with changes to U.S. visa policy, and he pressed for recent directives to relax regulatory burdens be ''rigorously implemented to boost confidence.''

There are three main impediment ­s to solving the economic problems. First is the fact that american business is sitting on unpreceden ­ted amounts of cash but refuses to invest it in american jobs. Second is the fact that the non-two percenters are pretty much tapped out financiall ­y with only mediocre prospects for relief until something is done about good paying jobs here in the US. Third is the fact that major american businesses have said that they expect 70% of their revenues to come from overseas. So we have business which benefits from overseas cheap labor, growing overseas markets, and the indirect effect of government relieving them of responsibi ­lity for pensions, healthcare and even dislocatio ­ns due to layoffs having no incentive to do anything differentl ­y than they are now. We need incentives for business to create good paying american jobs, disincenti ­ves for business which sends jobs overseas, strong unions to balance corporate power to regulate wages and benefits, and tighter regulation ­s to insure the rules are followed. As to cutting expenditur ­es, frugality is always good, but keep in mind that the goal of the GOP in this current round of deficit reduction is the destructio ­n of social security, medicare and medicaid, not the economy.  oldsquare: Summers is correct in that additional money in the pockets http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/oldsquare/larry-summers-calls-for-n_n_875678_92376402.html  History   |   Permalink   |  Share it            HUFFPOST SUPER USER Larry Andre Lakewood, CA Former Republican Candidate for Congr  191 Fans           03:15 PM on 6/13/2011  Mr. Obama is spinning mightily to try to distract attention from two damning facts: The unemployme ­nt rate today is much higher than it was when he took office (in January of 2009, it was 7.6 percent), and is higher than what his chief economic adviser at the time said it might be if his stimulus package were not passed. The stimulus bill, the auto bailouts and schemes to prop up housing have taken great gobs of money from taxpayers and transferre ­d a fair amount of it to the president' ­s political cronies. But the massive debt they've incurred is crippling the economy rather than helping it. Our national debt was $10.7 trillion when Mr. Obama took office. It's $14.29 trillion now. Jack Kelly of Real Clear Politics wrote today. "Still, the president is intent upon heaping additional burdens on the private sector. He held a meeting with House Republican ­s June 1 to discuss raising the ceiling on the national debt so the government can borrow more money. Republican ­s insist federal spending be cut by $1 for each dollar the debt ceiling is raised. Mr. Obama wants to reduce the deficit in part by raising taxes."  http://www ­.realclear ­politics.c ­om/article ­s/2011/06/ ­12/obama_i ­s_spinning ­_mightily_ ­110176.htm ­l  Larry_Andre: Mr. Obama is spinning mightily to try to distract attention http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/Larry_Andre/larry-summers-calls-for-n_n_875678_92369926.html  History   |   Permalink   |  Share it         HUFFPOST SUPER USER TheScarletPimpernel The fox the fox The Pimpernel  261 Fans     04:46 PM on 6/13/2011  There is no burden on the private sector ?

The Stimulus package was nothing but supply side economics from a liberal slant, rather than tax cuts for Americans and business, it was tax Americans, bail out banks, unions, and cronies and hope the money trickles down to the serfs.

Our economic problems did not start with a CREDIT CRUNCH due to over spending by GOVT or borrowing it had zero to do with it. Our economic problems started with the bursting of a housing buble and the fact nobody had the amount of money leveraged against US Housing and the loss of confidence by investors in these holdings. It was not because the Govt could not pay its bill it was because private COMPANIES could not pay. Investors did not want to invest in PRIVATE INDUSTRY, Private industry could not raise capital so they layed people off thus the lack of demand.... ­nothing what so ever to do with GOVT borrowing or DEBT ZERO. Now the right scream about "crowding out " crowding out " WHO ? form WHAT WHERE and WHEN Just so you get it righties when 30 yr home mortgages are at 4.75% there aint no crowding out.
