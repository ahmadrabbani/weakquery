March of the Penguins shows the unique migration and harsh conditions in which these flightless birds live.  Learning Guide Excerpt To demonstrate how our  Learning Guides can be used by  teachers to improve lesson plans, we have set out below one of the Discussion Questions from the  Learning Guide to  March of the Penguins . In the summer, emperor penguins live and feed in Antarctic ocean waters. In the Antarctic fall, March and April, they go onto the pack ice to pair up and to breed. The mother lays the egg which the father (still at the breeding ground on the pack ice) incubates in a special insulated pouch. This takes most of the arctic winter. Penguins eat fish and other animals found in the ocean. There is no food for them on the pack ice. After the mother lays the egg, she returns to the ocean to feed. When the egg hatches, the mother travels back over the pack ice to feed the chick with food regurgitated from her stomach. By that time, the father will have been without food for about four months. The mother then takes responsibility for the chick while the starving father returns to the sea. He comes back to the breeding ground with a stomach full of food for the chick. The parents then take turns going back and forth with one babysitting and feeding the chick on the pack ice while the other goes to the ocean to get food. This continues until the summer (December or January) when the chick is old enough to fend for itself. Certainly, the ocean and the pack ice are different biomes. Do emperor penguins engage in classic biome migration in which animals move from one biome to another?
