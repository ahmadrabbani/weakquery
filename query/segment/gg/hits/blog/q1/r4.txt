 Craftberry Bush: March of the penguins

                                                  Pages Home                                                        Tuesday, December 7, 2010   March of the penguins        It's Sunday afternoon and the snow is falling like powdered sugar over a sweet dessert.      My kiddies noses are pressed against the window as they watch this magical confetti turn the ground into a soft white blanket.  T     heir excitement fills the air as they quickly gather their snow gear and prepare to step into a winter wonderland .    Sometimes creativity blossoms out of the blue; sometimes it takes a little more effort; but if you just let inspiration take you away, anything can happen, including something like this.......                                 May I show you something?                   My original idea when making these little penguins was to have the kiddies take them outside and knock them down with snow balls, like a carnival kinda game. But after painting their cute little faces, I fell in love with them   (I say that in the humblest way possible) and decided to paint the rest of them to coordinate with the     stocking advent     calendar.  And I am happy to report, they have marched up the stairs and reside safely in the warmth of our upstairs hallway.    Needless to say, I will have to make other little creatures for use during snow ball target practice (perhaps I have found another use for an earlier    creation   ?)         And here we are, acting like penguins on a perfect winter afternoon.     I hope you allow your creativity to take you away today.......     much love,   Lucy      Linking to:                Posted by  Craftberry Bush   at   12:50 AM                  Email This    BlogThis!

December 23, 2010 6:26 AM                Denise said...  Darling, darling, darling. I want to make some. But I have some questions.  1.After you sprayed them with primer, did you use craft acrylic pants? 2. Did you glue the two halves together, or just wedge one inside the other? If you did glue, what brand or type of glue did you use? 3. Did you weight them with sand before you put them together? Thanks for the close-ups. It helps us less-talented people get an idea of how to make the knit hat and scarf LOOK like a knit hat and scarf. I will check back for your answers so you don't have to hunt around for my blog.

Newer Post    Older Post   Home   Subscribe to:  Post Comments (Atom)          This is who I am   Craftberry Bush   As a little girl, I dreamt in colour and I still do. In the winter, I long for colour but find calmness in the whites of the snow; spring's welcoming tulips fill me with joy; the summer's glow of the sun over the fields of ferns make me want to dance and in the fall as the leaves dress in their royal reds and oranges to say farewell, I am inspired. Inspired to create. And amongst all that nature as my children enjoy life along with me, they are my biggest inspiration. Some may call me an artist. I call myself a mother, a wife and a woman who loves life and dreams in colour.
