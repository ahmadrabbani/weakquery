Moderate conservatives opposed to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won a majority of seats, followed by reformists who were suppressed by hardliners in 2004, according to final results from last Friday's elections announced yesterday by the Interior Ministry. The vote is widely seen as a sign of public discontent with Mr Ahmadinejad's hardline stances, which have fuelled fights with the West and led Iran closer to UN sanctions. Moves towards sanctions are continuing at the UN, with European sponsors of a resolution to take steps against Iran for its refusal to halt sensitive nuclear activities submitting a freshly revised draft to the UN Security Council and calling for a vote today. Mr Ahmadinejad's uncompromising stand on Iran's nuclear program, together with his anti-Israel rhetoric, are believed to have divided the conservatives who voted him into power last year. Some conservatives feel Mr Ahmadinejad has spent too much time confronting the US and its allies and failed to deal with Iran's struggling economy. The vote also represents a partial comeback for reformists, who favour closer ties with the West and a further loosening of social and political restrictions imposed under Iran's Islamic Government. In Tehran, candidates supporting Mayor Mohammed Baqir Qalibaf, a moderate conservative, won seven of 15 council seats. Reformists won four, while Mr Ahmadinejad's allies won three. The last seat went to a wrestling champion considered an independent. The vote does not directly affect Mr Ahmadinejad's administration and is not expected to bring immediate policy changes, but it represents the first time the public has weighed in on Mr Ahmadinejad's stormy presidency since he took office in June 2005. The rebuff is expected to pressure him to change his populist anti-Western tone and focus more on Iran's high unemployment and economic problems. The revised UN draft is a major concession to Russia, the principal dissenter during the months it has taken to settle on the language of the resolution, and eases a travel ban on people involved in Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Instead of directing countries to prevent entry of such people into their territory, the resolution now "calls upon" states to "exercise vigilance" over those who cross their borders. It also gives greater leeway to a monitoring committee that would be set up under the resolution. Earlier drafts had more limits on how it would determine which people and entities should be listed as suspected participants in nuclear activities and therefore subject to a freeze of their assets. In addition, the new draft qualifies a freeze on assets of such people and gives countries more time  60 days instead of 30  to report to the committee on how they are complying with the demands of the resolution. The major thrust of the resolution is to demand that Iran immediately end all enrichment of uranium, which can produce fuel for power plants but also for atomic bombs, and cease all its research and development work on the kinds of activities that are aimed at making weapons.
