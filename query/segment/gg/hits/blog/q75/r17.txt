Israel has intensified its attacks on Lebanon to put pressure on the government and force Hezbollah to free the two Israeli soldiers it captured Wednesday. Syria and Iran are the top backers of the Shiite Hezbollah guerrilla group in Lebanon.  "If the occupying regime of Jerusalem attacks Syria, it will be equivalent to an attack on the whole Islamic world and the regime (Israel) will face a crushing response" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying by IRNA.  Ahmadinejad made the comments in a telephone conversation with Syrian President Bashar Assad to assure him of his support, the agency said.  The Iranian leader called on Muslim countries to create a united front against Israel.  "The Islamic world, especially countries in this region, need more unity and integrity, particularly in the context of Lebanon and Palestine," Ahmadinejad said.  Separately, the spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, Hamid Reza Asefi, denied Israeli allegations that the captured Israeli soldiers were being transferred to Iran.  On Thursday, Israel said it had information that Hezbollah guerrillas were trying to transfer the soldiers to Iran, apparently to prevent Israeli troops from rescuing them.  "These sort of accusations are simply nonsense," Asefi said, according to IRNA.  The head of Israel's northern command, Maj. Gen. Udi Adam, said Wednesday that Israel did not intend "at the moment" to take action against Syria over Hezbollah's capture of the soldiers.
