He lives the life that most mortal men don't get to live. He's smart enough not to get married. Most importantl ­y, he's smart enough not to get any girl pregnant. For a millionair ­e playboy, he knows to avoid alimony and child support like the plague. Clooney, Derek Jeter and Leo DiCapprio are all doing it right. I hope they stay on that course. Pro athletes need to follow their examples.     Leto_II: I admire Clooney.
