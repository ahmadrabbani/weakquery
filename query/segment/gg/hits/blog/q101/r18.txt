George Clooney has reportedly found love again.   George Clooney is to move in with his new cocktail-waitress girlfriend. The Hollywood hunk – who has been dating 23-year-old Lucy Wolvert for two months – is reportedly so smitten with the blonde beauty he wants to move her into his Los Angeles mansion so he can see her everyday. According to the MailOnline website, a source said: “They’ve started out casual, but things are moving fast and she’s told friends they’re planning to spend a large part of the summer together. She’s talking about moving in with George in Los Angeles which is pretty amazing considering they’ve only known each other a couple of months.” Advertisement: Story continues below    The couple reportedly first got together while George was filming his forthcoming movie  Up In The Air in Miami Beach, Florida. However, friends of Lucy’s are concerned the 48-year-old actor – who reportedly flies to see her in Miami every weekend - will break her heart. The source continued: “Lucy is totally smitten with George and he’s drawn to her in a passionate way. Everyone’s just hoping it lasts and she doesn’t get her heart broken.” The aspiring model has reportedly already been warned to be more discreet about the blossoming romance after she gossiped about George’s bedroom techniques with friends. The source added: “Besides being an amazing lover, Lucy says George is a true gentleman who really knows how to treat a lady.” Last year, George ended his year-long relationship to other cocktail waitress Sarah Larson.
