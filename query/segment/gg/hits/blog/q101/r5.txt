Just dont call up the mullet pics during the jobbing telly days (pre ER doc-to-die-for explosion).  Turning to acting when he struck out of trials for the Cincinnati Reds baseball team, Clooney charted the choppy waters of failed TV pilots and  Return of the Killer Tomatoes to emerge a bona fide leading man, who divides his time between money-spinning crowd-pleasers and thoughtful, political and less bankable outings. Which, for our dollar, is exactly what you should do when you get the clout.  Best Supporting Actor Oscar-winner for  Syriana (probably should have won for  Good Night And Good Luck ), hes the guy that almost killed the Dark Knight in  Batman And Robin , and is currently mourning the death of Max, his beloved pig (and longer-term companion than any of the sexy model-actress types), who was a pressie from former flatmate Kelly Preston, and died on 1 Dec 2006. RIP PIG.
