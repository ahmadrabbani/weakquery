George Clooney says his chequered past precludes a political career.   Actor George Clooney will play a flawed presidential candidate in his latest movie, but he has again rejected the notion of running for politics in real life. "I didn't live my life the right way for politics, you know," the Oscar-winning actor told  Newsweek magazine in a cover story about his humanitarian work in Sudan. "I f**ked too many chicks and did too many drugs, and that's the truth," said Clooney, who has twice been declared  People magazine's sexiest man alive. Advertisement: Story continues below    Clooney, 49, said a smart political campaigner would "start from the beginning by saying, 'I did it all. I drank the bong water. Now let's talk about issues' That's gonna be my campaign slogan: 'I drank the bong water.'?" Clooney, who won an Oscar in 2006 for his supporting role in  Syriana , gave a similar rejoinder in 2007 to suggestions that he should run for the US Senate against Republican Mitch McConnell. Clooney, a political liberal, was named a United Nations messenger of peace in 2008 for his efforts to draw international attention to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, Sudan. He told  Newsweek his job in the region was to "amplify the voice of the guy who lives here and is worried about his wife and children being slaughtered". "And if he finds me and asks, 'You got a big megaphone?' and I say 'Yes.' 'You got a decent-size mountain to yell it from?'. 'Yeah, I got a pretty-good sized mountain.' 'Will you do me a favour and yell it?' And I go 'Absolutely.'" Clooney is currently working on the movie  The Ides of March about an idealistic staffer for a new presidential candidate who gets a crash course in dirty politics. Clooney will direct and star in the film, and he co-wrote the screenplay.

WinterRose | Sydney - February 24, 2011, 9:49AM    George should stick to acting. He'll fail miserably if he goes into politics. If the above article is anything to go by and he's telling the truth about himself: too many chicks and bong water. He will fail. Politicians don't tell the truth. Clooney will be an abject failure if he tells the truth in politics. Stick to acting George.  Actor manager | Fitzroy - February 24, 2011, 9:50AM    I can't remember who said it, but it was to the effect that if the everyday details of anybody's private life became publicly known it would cause shock and disgust. What a world. An intelligent, thoughtful, and honest person has no chance at a political career. So mostly we get either liars or dullards...or both.  Redsaunas - February 24, 2011, 9:57AM    Ultimately I believe we would all be better off if we could accept politicans are and should be human too. In fact I would welcome a political candidate who was honest enough to say I've "drank the bong water and kept some interesting company". Ultimately I want to know they are human and have lived a life not closetted away but shared and understood by much of the community. Whatever you think of George Clooney, a candidate who has lived a varied life and has travelled and seen much of other societies and can empathise and sympathise is a candidate worth considering.  JMP | Melbourne - February 24, 2011, 10:08AM    Great idea big G. I am fresh out of the green, and feeling a little thirsty anyways, so bottoms up! BTW, how many is too many chicks?  I'd vote for you, dude.  dude, where's my mind | the couch - February 24, 2011, 10:11AM    If what he says is true, and politics is out, then he better get back to making decent movies again. The list of outs is getting long.  Stephen - February 24, 2011, 10:12AM    The poll results (so far only 150 votes) surprise me.  Maybe there is yet hope for our democracy. It SHOULD be about policy, but it is ALWAYS about spin, character assassination, hidden agendas....  marke - February 24, 2011, 10:14AM    Being a partying drug taking playboy didn't hurt Dubya's chances at getting into politics now did it? Nor did being ignorant, intolerant, ill-informed, and unable to string an intelligible sentence together when speaking publicly.  Awww come on... | Melbourne - February 24, 2011, 10:18AM    Couldn't agree more, JMP and Redsaunas!!! I'm sure alot of politicians have done the same but lie about it. So who would we prefer? Their past doesn't really matter...in fact I'd prefer to have a leader whose actually experienced all facets of life rather than one that's hiding behind a bible... but do we want the honest guy or the dishonest one? The dishonest one can do SO much more damage ( Easy to prove, just look at the world we live in.)
