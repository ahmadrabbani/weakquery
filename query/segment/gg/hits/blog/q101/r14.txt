A prominent member of a conservative futuristic society grows concerned that the culture stifles creativity, and commissions a controversial interactive book for his daughter, which serves as her guide through a surreal alternate world. When the primer's provocative technology, which adapts to the reader's responses, falls into the hands of a young innocent, the girl's life is accidentally reprogrammed with dangerous results. Neal Stephenson will adapt his own novel for this project, the first time the Hugo and Nebula winning author has written for the small screen.

I want to be involved! I live in PDX but I can travel. I am not really up on the film industry but The Diamond Age is one of my favorite books and I have always wanted to film it somehow. Because of the depth of imagery I always thought it would make a great Anime style movie. Congratulations on acquiring the rights and with Stephenson writing, it should be terrific. I would love just to hang around the set and take photos or do drawings. If you have any entry level positions on this project get in touch with me through my myspace page.... http://www.myspace.com/georgere nan George Link  |  Reply  |  Thread               novuswolf   wrote:  Mar. 28th, 2007 09:02 pm (UTC)   Finally I've been waiting for this for a long time. I get all giddy just thinking about it. If there's anything I can do to help, please let me know. I do stained glass, voices, I'm nice, I can type. Seriously, anything.
