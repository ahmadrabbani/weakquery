Get It Now         Elisabetta Canalis: I Had a 'Father-Daughter Relationship' with George Clooney By Michelle Tauber Saturday October 29, 2011 12:15 PM EDT   Elisabetta Canalis and George Clooney Jamie McCarthy/WireImage          Facebook  Tweet      Bacio and tell?  Elisabetta Canalis, the Italian TV personality who dated  George Clooney for two years until their  split last June, offers some surprising details about their relationship in  Questo Amore ( This Love ), a new book by Italian journalist Bruno Vespa.  Praising the Oscar winner, 50, as "the person who valued my feminine side the most" and "also one of the best people I have met from a charitable point of view," Canalis, 33, went on to say, "he has been a special for me, and very important, just as a father would be."  Asked by Vespa to elaborate, she said, "between us there was more of a father-daughter relationship. I was unable to clarify this up 'til now."    RELATED: Elisabetta Canalis: Dancing Is Not My Thing  As for their breakup, Canalis – who  competed on  Dancing with the Stars earlier this season, denies reports that Clooney's long-held aversion to marriage was an issue.  "George and I never spoke of marriage nor of having kids," she says. "I don't put limits to the possibility of having them, but neither George nor I had ever envisaged having kids together. The end of the relationship was not caused by a marriage issue, but instead by our personal needs."  Although Clooney has since moved on with another  Dancing alum, Stacy Keibler, Canalis has only kind words for him.  "George is a real gentleman even in his private life," she says. "I was very much respected both as a woman and partner."    Reporting by PRAXILLA TRABATONNI George Clooney From the PEOPLE TV Archive See More Videos              The Latest on George Clooney  George Clooney: More News & Photos     See Latest 10 Photos   George Clooney: My Girlfriend 'Can Kick My Ass'  Elisabetta Canalis: I Had a 'Father-Daughter Relationship' with George Clooney  George Clooney & Stacy Keibler Enjoy Dinner and a Movie in Paris  Stacy Keibler Vacations in 'Paradise' with George Clooney           Visit George Clooney's PEOPLE Page          PeopleTV  Ashley: Vamp on Fire!
