He won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role in  Syriana but failed to win that ever-elusive Academy Award for Best Actor for his latest role in  Jason Reitman 's  Up in the Air. His reputation as a lady's man gets about as much attention as his film roles. He was linked to Italian TV personality  Elisabetta Canalis , who we thought was the one beauty capable of turning Hollywood's most iconic bachelor into a one-woman man, but the couple called it quits. He has since been linked to  Stacey Keibler .  George Clooney Quote " Run for office? No. I've slept with too many women, I've done too many drugs and I've been to too many parties. "   95  Magnetism  George Clooney is the epitome of a class act. The man has been at the top of  People magazine's Most Beautiful People list since he had us convinced he'd been to med school, with no signs of him dropping off anytime soon. He's dated a plethora of babes ( Lisa Snowdon for example), making  Leonardo DiCaprio look like he's barely scratched the surface of babedom in his amateur philandering. Part of his charm? George Clooney always dresses sharply and looks debonair, no matter if he's stepping out onto a red carpet or taking his date on a motorbike ride across the Italian countryside.     83 Success George Clooney has had a bumpy ride up the Hollywood ladder. He started acting seriously at age 21, and after appearing in about 15 failed TV shows, he got his big break and on  ER . He called it quits after five years and left the show for a film career. His record in Hollywood had been spotty, but he seems to have turned things around with his big-screen hit,  The Perfect Storm . George Clooney also received critical acclaim and a Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe for his part in  O Brother, Where Art Thou? , even though the film didn't do very well at the box office. He has filled the boots of Batman in one installment of the franchise, but the movie did not perform to expectations and therefore marked his only appearance has the Caped Crusader. Yet, the films he's been involved with on multiple levels, from acting to directing and producing -- flicks like  Michael Clayton and  Leatherheads  -- have been met with high praise. He won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for  Syriana but lost the Oscar for Best Actor for his work in 2009's  Up in the Air , directed by Jason Reitman. He returned to the director's chair for the film  The Ides of March , which he also stars in opposite  Ryan Gosling .
