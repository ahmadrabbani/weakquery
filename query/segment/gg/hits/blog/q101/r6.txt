However, it sounds like Canalis apparently never completely believed the Academy Award winner’s steadfast insistence that he never again wants to walk down the aisle. “George has always been so clear about the ‘M’ word,” said a longtime friend of Clooney’s. “Elisabetta was convinced that she could change his mind — and after a while that really began to bug George.” On top of that issue, I’ve learned that the couple found fewer and fewer interests in common. Plus, Clooney reportedly was upset that Canalis had tried to use her relationship with him to further her aspirations to develop a major American movie and modeling career. According to another Clooney source, there is not a third party involved.   HEIR-RAISING ISSUE: While the late Peter Falk’s estranged daughter Catherine reportedly wants to use the “Columbo” star’s battle with Alzheimer’s to challenge his estate plans — leaving the bulk of his estimated $5 million in assets to longtime wife Shera Falk — I’ve heard Shera isn’t particularly worried. The actor signed all of his will and trust agreements years ago — long before he sadly was afflicted with Alzheimer’s. On top of that, his wife of 33 years was well-known as being totally devoted to him and his care.   ALMOST FORGOT:  Given the long, bitter battle between Mel Gibson and ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva, it’s easy to forget the actor and his estranged wife Robyn Gibson had yet to finalize their divorce. That’s now near, with lawyers for both appearing in an L.A. courtroom Tuesday and announcing the couple have reached agreement on the terms of their divorce — expected to be finalized in August.   STAR POWER: Jennifer Hudson has another film added to her slate. Along with playing a nun in Bobby and Peter Farrelly’s “Three Stooges” movie — currently lensing in Atlanta — Chicago’s own Oscar and Grammy winner will have a supporting role in “Mister and Pete,” directed by Columbia College Chicago grad George Tillman Jr. (“Faster,” “Soul Food,” “Notorious”) and co-produced by music megastar Alicia Keys, who co-starred with Hudson in “The Secret Life of Bees.”  Hudson will play a New York drug addict whose arrest forces her son and his best friend to make it on their own.  VROOM! VROOM!  Mayor Rahm Emanuel is slated to cut the ribbon Thursday for veteran car dealer Joe Perillo’s latest venture — Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Gold Coast — featuring a program hosted by Dominic DiFrisco and a cake created by “Cake Boss” Buddy Valastro. † Legendary Hollywood car czar George Barris, currently a judge on Speed Channel’s “Car Warriors,” will host the Volo Auto Museum’s charity car show and festival Sunday, where Barris’ famed Batmobile and Disney’s “Lighting McQueen” from “Cars” will be on display.  TOAST TIME: After the two Rod Blagojevich trials — especially the second one — you can imagine the posse of media types on that beat have come to know each other pretty well. Playing off of the convicted ex-gov’s love of all things Elvis, legal eagle and WGN-Channel 9 contributor Terry Sullivan has organized a “Fall from Grace(land) Post-Verdict Party” Thursday night for reporters who covered the Blago trials — where you can bet there will be some great stories swapped!   ROYAL RULES: Britain’s PR-savvy Prince William and his new bride, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, are getting kudos for traveling with only a personal entourage of six for their first overseas official tour, to Canada and L.A. While that small team of assistants and aides is reportedly the tiniest in royal travel history, I have learned the couple’s security detail is very large. The exact number? That’s a state secret. “If I told you, I’d have to kill you,” said my London palace insider — with a tone that sounded like she was only half-kidding.  SEEN ON THE SCENE: Actress Sienna Miller — joined by a group of folks working on her “Just Like a Woman” film (due out next year) — were in town for the opening of David Henry Hwang’s “Chinglish” at the Goodman. Miller’s “Just” castmate Tim Guinee is a pal of Goodman artistic director Bob Falls. “Chinglish” is Broadway-bound — heading to one of the New York Shubert theaters this fall. … “The Playboy Club” star Eddie Cibrian and new bride LeAnn Rimes were spied happily brunching at RL.
