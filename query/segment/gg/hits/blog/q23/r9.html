<P>Exobiologists seek to understand how life originated on Earth by
studying chemical and physical conditions elsewhere in our solar
system and our galaxy. The origin of life on Earth is not well
understood but was evidently based on chemical evolution from simple
compounds present on the newly formed planet to create a system of
replicating organic chemicals. Unfortunately, it is difficult to
study early Earth directly because the earliest geological formations
have been largely erased by erosion and deposition. In contrast, on
Mars we can still see the early crust in the form of heavily cratered
highlands. Major exobiology goals for Mars are to</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Determine whether life presently exists on Mars or, as is
   thought more likely, has existed in the past
   
   <LI>Define the nature of early martian environments and understand
   differences from the early environments of Earth
   
   <LI>Determine the history of the biogenic elements (Carbon,
   Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Sulphur, Phosphorus) on Mars and of
   organic chemistry there (that is, the chemistry of carbon bearing
   compounds whether biologic or abiologic in origin)
</OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In order to achieve these goals,
<A HREF="../../Home/Robomissions.html">Mars exploration
spacecraft</A> will visit sites where we may expect to find
sedimentary rocks containing evidence of biologically-important
minerals (such as carbonates, sulfates, phosphates) and preserved
organic compounds. (Note that organic molecules are rapidly destroyed
at the surface of Mars today by the intense ultraviolet light from
the Sun -- light that, on Earth, is filtered out by our ozone layer).
Mars exploration may even lead to the discovery of a fossil record of
past microbial life.</P>
