<P>Review of the "evidence" of past life on Mars from
the meteorite AHL84001 shows that only those already persuaded
could be convinced. The organic compounds found lack the oxygen,
nitrogen and sulfur that compose the amino acids that form protein.
The authors of the report in Science readily admit that "organic
compounds" does not mean "biogenic compounds."
The "evidence" from AHL84001, like Rorschach inkblots,
tells us more about the role of preconceptions than about Mars.</P>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<P>President Clinton gave a news conference on the South Lawn
of the White House on August 7, 1996. He spoke about the meteorite
Allan Hills 84001 or for short, ALH84001 (See <A HREF="#marsfig1">Figure
1</A>). The President noted that ALH84001 had been picked up on
a glacier in Antarctica in 1984. He discussed briefly the history
of ALH84001 from its formation four billion years ago on Mars,
its escape as a consequence of the shock from the impact of a
body striking Mars, the 16 million-year journey through space
and its arrival 13, 000 years ago on a glacier in Antarctica.
He expressed both enthusiasm and caution on the question that
ALH84001 carries "evidence" of past life on Mars. He
supported an aggressive plan for the robotic exploration of Mars
and noted that an unmanned mission to Mars is scheduled to lift
off from Kennedy Space Center in November, 1996 and a second mission
will lift off in December, 1996. He noted that the first mission
is to land on Mars on July 4, 1997--Independence Day!</P>

<P>Those scientists and their supporters who steadfastly desire
manned missions to Mars were alarmed by the President's emphasis
on robot exploration by unmanned missions. Robot explorations
will be made before the "evidence" attained will persuade
Congress to fund the enormously expensive manned missions to Mars.
That will push the scheduling of manned missions, if they are
ever made, to the middle of the twenty-first century and beyond
the lifetime of living manned-mission enthusiasts.</P>

<P>Mr. Daniel Goldin, NASA Administrator, held a briefing on the
"Discovery of Possible Early Martian Life" at the NASA
Headquarters in Washington, DC. Mr. Goldin is well-known for his
enthusiasm for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, life
on planets around stars, manned missions to Mars and the search
for "evidence" of life on Mars. The several members
of the team of scientists, McKay et al.<A HREF="#note1">1</A>
reviewed the "evidence" provided by the scientific examination
of ALH84001:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>the meteorite came from Mars.
  <LI>the meteorite contains the mineral calcite, calcium carbonate,
  the chemical that is found in limestone.
  <LI>the meteorite contains organic material: polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons.
  <LI>the presence of very small crystals of magnetite and iron
  pyrite.
  <LI>bodies that were interpreted as microfossils.
</UL>

<P>Each member of the team cautioned that the observations were
neither conclusive nor confirming evidence for a biological origin.
They pointed out a number of times that the term "organic
compounds" does not necessarily mean "biogenic compounds".
This provides a window of deniability that NASA ever said that
ALH84001 had evidence of life on Mars. At the same time that is
just what the President, the Congress, the press, and the public
now believe.</P>

<P>In judging the "evidence" that ALH84001 may provide,
let us remember that the President, the Vice President, and most
of the members of the Senate and House are lawyers. Their concept
of "evidence" differs from that in science. For example,
a witness testifies that he saw me sitting on a bench across the
street from a bank on three consecutive days at the same time.
The bank was robbed the next day. That testimony is "evidence"
or "probable cause" that I was casing the joint. Although
I was just reading the morning paper, I would be put on the witness
stand under oath and required to justify my suspicious actions.
This, I argue, is a misleading use of "evidence," and
distracts Congress and the public from the real scientific issues.</P>

<P>Mars is often portrayed to the public as our "brother"
and most Earth-like planet, now that surface temperature and other
factors have eliminated Venus in the search for life in the solar
system. The question of life on Mars has a long and dismal history.<A
HREF="#note2">2</A> Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835-1910) thought
he saw "canali", or "channels", often mistranslated
from the Italian as "canals." Percival Lowell (1855-1916),
nearly a century ago, believed he could see markings on Mars he
called "canals", that had been made by intelligent beings.
He prepared a detailed map showing how the courageous Martians,
superior to humankind on Earth, were building public works to
aid in their survival on an aging and desiccating planet. This
view of Mars has since proved to be poetical fantasy. Nevertheless,
Mars has long been the darling of space enthusiasts.</P>

<P>The Martian sidereal day is 24.6229 hours, slightly longer
than the Earth's sidereal day of 23.9345 hours. The inclination
of the equator of Mars to the orbit is 23.98x; that of the Earth
is 23.45x. But there the resemblance vanishes. Mars may be Earth's
"little brother" because it is only 10.74 % as massive
as the Earth. Its gravity is only 38% that of Earth--a 300-pound
football player on Earth would weigh 114 pounds on Mars.</P>

<P>The sparse atmosphere of Mars, a near-vacuum pressure only
0.6% of that on Earth, is composed of 95.3% carbon dioxide, 2.7%
nitrogen, 0.13% oxygen and traces of water and the noble gases.
The mere trace of oxygen does not provide an ozone shield to protect
the surface from the intense ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.
Mars does not have an appreciable magnetic field to protect the
surface from the ionizing radiation of solar flares. Because of
its thin atmosphere, Mars has been subjected to sterilizing ultraviolet
rays, the solar wind, and ionizing radiation since it lost its
primeval atmosphere 4.5 billion years ago.</P>

<P>In spite of the well-known inauspicious nature of the climate
of Mars for the survival of life, and even more so for the origin
of life, five robot spacecraft were sent to the red planet to
search for life in the early 1960s, at great expense to United
States taxpayers.<A HREF="#note2">2</A> The flybys of <I>Mariners
4, 6</I> and <I>7</I> returned television pictures that showed
ancient impact craters much like those on the Moon. The features
Percival Lowell had imagined disappeared like a wraith. <I>Mariner
9</I> went into orbit in 1971 and operated for 11 months, returning
pictures that showed four gigantic extinct volcanoes and a multitude
of channels, some hundreds of kilometers long. (These channels
are invisible from Earth and have nothing to do with the canals
of Percival Lowell.) However, the number of meteoritic impact
craters that overlay these channels showed that they must have
been made very early in the history of Mars. Evidence for even
very short-lived oceans on Mars can be seen only by the dedicated
advocates of future Mars exploration.</P>

<P>In the summer of 1976, two <I>Viking</I> spacecraft arrived
at Mars and were placed in orbit. <I>Lander 1</I> touched down
on July 20, 1976, and<I>Lander 2</I> on September 3, on the opposite
side of Mars. The two orbiters and <I>Lander 2</I> operated for
two years while <I>Lander 1</I> operated for six years. The instrument
used to measure and identify organic matter, called a gas chromatograph-mass
spectrometer, is sensitive to parts per billion. The only carbon
compounds found on Mars were traced to the cleaning solvents used
in the manufacture of the instrument.2 Thus two speculations fell
with one blow: the existence of life on Mars, and one of the sources
that had been proposed for organic matter in the ocean of primeval
soup on Earth. Other tests for life on Mars also failed to detect
any evidence of life, past or present. Nevertheless, further exploration
of Mars is one of NASA's top priorities.</P>

<P>NASA must adhere to its official policy on the origin of life
as it applies to Mars. The standard model for the origin of life
is given by Christopher P. McKay<A HREF="#note3">3</A> in his
NASA <I>Urey Prize Lecture: Planetary Evolution and the Origin
of Life:</I></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The standard model of the origin of life on Earth was first
  given form by Oparin4 and Haldane and begins with the abiotic
  production of organic molecules. Abiotic chemical evolution is
  then thought to occur in the presence of liquid water, resulting
  in more complex structures leading to life itself and the onset
  of biological evolution. The standard model for the origin of
  life posits that life is a naturally emergent property of matter
  in Earth-like environments and would develop rapidly on any similar
  body.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This conjecture, coupled with theories for planet formation,
results in the prediction that life should have originated on
Mars in its early warm and wet period, from 4.0 to 3.0 billion
years ago. The proposal that Mars, early in its history, had some
complement of water and an atmosphere of carbon dioxide and nitrogen
much more dense than today is not unreasonable.<A HREF="#note5">5</A>,<A
HREF="#note6">6</A>,<A HREF="#note7">7</A>,<A HREF="#note8">8</A>
This is shown by channels that are very similar to canyons cut
on Earth in catastrophic floods. But the mere presence of water
flowing in channels is not sufficient; an ocean is required to
develop a "primeval soup" that, according to standard
theory, is necessary for the origin of life. The prospects for
large oceans on Mars are much less than on Earth.</P>

<P>As the primeval magma cooled, the Earth's steam atmosphere
condensed to provide enough water to cover the surface to 2,700
meters, or about 8,900 feet, deep. Estimates of the amount of
water on the much smaller surface area of Mars vary from 10 or
20 meters to 200 meters. Proposals by both reduction mechanists
and dialectical materialists for the required time to generate
a "primeval soup" of prebiotic carbon compounds on a
"suitable" planet vary from 100 million years to a billion.
Proponents of the "life on Mars" scenario must establish
that there were substantial oceans with a "primeval soup"
on Mars for comparable lengths of time. I have showed in previous
publications<A HREF="#note9">9</A>,<A HREF="#note10">10</A>,<A
HREF="#note11">11</A> that there never was a "primeval soup"
in the Earth's ocean, and by the same token, there never was a
"primeval soup" on Mars.</P>

<P>McKay et al.<A HREF="#note1">1</A> call for Martian and earthly
biomarkers suitable for identifying biogenic activity on Mars.
Among such markers is the conspicuous fractionation of the light
isotope 12C in the conversion of carbon dioxide to living matter
by biochemical pathways. 13C is retained in the aqueous medium
in which the inorganic reactions occur, primarily in dissolved
bicarbonate.<A HREF="#note12">12</A>,<A HREF="#note13">13</A>
Consequently, on Earth or on Mars, substances generated by organisms
capable of metabolism exhibit a decrease of carbon <A HREF="#note13">13</A>
between -20 and -40 x with respect to the atmosphere. This is
consistent with the formation of kerogen, a fossilized biogenic
substance related to petroleum, in the 3.8 billion-year-old sedimentary
rocks found at Isua in Greenland. Schidlowski<A HREF="#note12">12</A>
shows that inorganic carbonate, formed by well-known principles
of physical chemistry, and the organic carbon of kerogen, are
divided clearly into two groups by their isotopic composition.</P>

<P>According to the NASA standard model, one may take the isotopic
character as a Martian biomarker by which one can judge the validity
of the claim of McKay et al.<A HREF="#note1">1</A> of having found
evidence of fossil life on Mars in the ALH84001 meteorite. Romanek,<A
HREF="#note14">14</A> one of the authors of McKay et al.,<A HREF="#note1">1</A>
reported that the 13C of the Martian atmosphere is x + 41.3 x
and compatible with the atmosphere of Mars being the source of
carbon in the carbonate of ALH84001. McKay et al.<A HREF="#note1">1</A>
do not report kerogens or their graphitic derivatives in ALH84001.
This is a telling blow to the belief that the carbonate in ALH84001
was generated by living organisms. ALH84001 is an igneous orthopyroxenite,
not a sedimentary rock. Accordingly, this is a second telling
blow to the belief that the carbonates in ALH84001 reflect biogenic
activity.</P>

<P>Amino acids, the components of protein, are found in a number
of meteorites, but not in ALH84001. The aromatic hydrocarbons
found in ALH84001 do not show a propensity for the selection of
12C. They are composed solely of carbon and hydrogen. A proteinous
sample of amino acids shows considerable oxygen and nitrogen as
well as sulfur. These polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are not
a biomarker for ALH84001.</P>

<P>McKay et al.<A HREF="#note1">1</A> rely on the morphology of
the carbonate globules in their interpretation of biogenic origin,
rather than on their isotopic composition. Speculations on the
morphology of models of living organisms have a long and dismal
history. Oparin<A HREF="#note4">4</A> referred to much of the
literature on the origin of life in the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, which proposed that life emerged from a primeval soup
in the early ocean from "coacervates" or colloids. That
was first proposed by Haeckel<A HREF="#note15">15</A> in 1866,
and was widely discussed by scientists, theologians, and the public
in the nineteenth century. The discussion of these efforts was
so widespread among the theater-going public in 1878 (sixteen
years before Oparin was born) that Sir William Schwenck Gilbert
(1836-1911) ridiculed it by having Pooh-Bah, a comic, greedy,
and conceited character, introduce himself by declaring that he
could trace his ancestry back to a "pre-Adamic protoplasmal
atomic globule".<A HREF="#note16">16</A></P>

<P>Jacques Loeb<A HREF="#note17">17</A>, a convinced mechanist,
cautioned in 1906 against the value of building models of living
organisms that, like the round granules in colloidal material,
merely resemble them but are not capable of development, growth,
or reproduction.</P>

<P>We often see what we want to see. Coacervate droplets, colloidal
precipitates or "proteinoids" proposed in attempts to
imitate or to model the first cells and the origin of life are
like Rorschach inkblots. They tell us more about the philosophical
preconceptions of the investigators and space exploration enthusiasts
than about the origin of life.</P>

<P>Mr. Goldin stated, at the NASA briefing, that if it is confirmed
that ALH84001 and, perhaps, other meteorites actually do contain
microfossils as "evidence for primitive life on Mars"
that means that life originated independently on a planet other
than Earth. It would follow then that life is common in the Milky
Galaxy. But is it possible that there was a two-way flow of meteorites<A
HREF="#note18">18</A> between Earth and Mars? The kerogen in the
sedimentary rocks at Isua in Greenland tell us that life was swarming
in the oceans of the Earth, 3.8 billion years ago. After the last
sterilizing event of the Late Heavy Bombardment, and before 3.8
billion years ago, bodies as large as 100 kilometers in diameter
continued to hit the rapidly spinning Earth. Could ejecta from
the sedimentary rocks have escaped Earth, orbited about in space
and struck Mars entering the primeval oceans of the time, carrying
life with them? Only one successful inoculation from Earth is
necessary for life to flourish in the oceans on early Mars.</P>

<P>These Earth-born meteorites will not be destroyed on Mars as
those from Mars are on Earth. There is no plate subduction on
Mars and for about three billion years, no ocean. Virtually the
entire inventory can be found on the surface of Mars, a much larger
area and for a very much longer window of time than is available
for the preservation of meteorites on Earth. There may be a treasure
trove of Earth-based meteorites lying about on Mars for the picking.</P>

<P>When at last Mars is explored by humans, some of the meteorites
they find may have come from the impact that caused the extinction
of the dinosaurs, 65 million years ago. The colliding object must
have been about 10 kilometers in diameter--that would be a
rock bigger than Mount Everest, which is only 8.8 kilometers high.
The object collided at a speed of 11 kilometers per second and
developed an energy of 100 million megatons of TNT. This energy
is sufficient to excavate a transient crater 45 to 60 kilometers
deep. After the walls slumped, the crater would still have been
17 to 20 kilometers deep. The prime candidate for the site of
collision is the buried Chicxulub crater in the Yucatan peninsula
in Mexico.<A HREF="#note19">19</A> The Chicxulub multi-ring basin
is about 180 kilometers in diameter, the result of one of the
largest collisions since the Late Heavy Bombardment during the
formation of Earth and Mars. The astronauts exploring Mars will
have no doubt about what to look for. Borings at the Chicxulub
crater have shown that in addition to the dolomite limestones,
the crater is underlain by anhydrite (CaSO4). The evidence for
exchange of meteorites between Earth and Mars is much stronger
than the evidence for "primitive life on Mars" presented
by McKay et al.<A HREF="#note1">1</A></P>

<P>McKay et al.<A HREF="#note1">1</A> conclude: "None of
these observations is in itself conclusive for the existence of
past life. Although there are alternative explanations for each
of these phenomena taken individually, when they are considered
collectively, particularly in view of their spatial association,
we conclude that they are evidence for primitive life on early
Mars."</P>

<P>The "evidence" that McKay et al.<A HREF="#note1">1</A>
present is no better than "probable cause" in the legal
sense, which justifies no conclusion but only further investigation.
It is clear that the contrary conclusion equally fits the data.
In science we are forced by the data to one or several credible
conclusions, eliminating others. The measurements of the carbon
isotopes do not show the required selection of 12C; ALH84001 is
an igneous orthopyroxenite, not a sedimentary rock. The Martian
carbonate globules are neither Pooh-Bah's "pre-Adamic protoplasmal
atomic globules," Rorschach inkblots, nor evidence of primitive
life on early Mars. To assert that ALH84001 exhibits evidence
for life is to ignore genetics<A HREF="#note17">17</A> and accept
Oparinism<A HREF="#note3">3</A>.</P>

<P>The facts on the question of life on Mars are that we must
leave the poetic fantasy of science fiction and reconcile ourselves
that life on Earth has no complement on Mars. The question of
funding manned missions to Mars reminds me of the great pyramids
of ancient Egypt. Those magnificent engineering achievements served
no practical purpose for the people of Egypt or the Pharaoh. They
were all looted in antiquity. The Romans were more practical.
They built aqueducts, bridges and roads.</P>
