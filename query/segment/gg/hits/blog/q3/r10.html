As Prepared for Delivery</B><br><B>State of the Union
Address</B><br><B>Tuesday, January 25,
2011</B><br><B>Washington, DC</B><p><I>As Prepared for
Delivery&#x2014;</I><p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President,
Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow
Americans:<p>Tonight I want to begin by congratulating
the men and women of the 112th Congress, as well as your new
Speaker, John Boehner. And as we mark this occasion, we are
also mindful of the empty chair in this Chamber, and pray
for the health of our colleague &#x2013; and our friend &#x2013; Gabby
Giffords.<p>It&#x2019;s no secret that those of us here
tonight have had our differences over the last two years.
The debates have been contentious; we have fought fiercely
for our beliefs. And that&#x2019;s a good thing. That&#x2019;s what a
robust democracy demands. That&#x2019;s what helps set us apart
as a nation.<p>But there&#x2019;s a reason the tragedy in
Tucson gave us pause. Amid all the noise and passions and
rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no
matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a
part of something greater &#x2013; something more consequential
than party or political preference.

</div></div>
<p>We are part of
the American family. We believe that in a country where
every race and faith and point of view can be found, we are
still bound together as one people; that we share common
hopes and a common creed; that the dreams of a little girl
in Tucson are not so different than those of our own
children, and that they all deserve the chance to be
fulfilled. <p>That, too, is what sets us apart as a
nation.<p>Now, by itself, this simple recognition
won&#x2019;t usher in a new era of cooperation. What comes of
this moment is up to us. What comes of this moment will be
determined not by whether we can sit together tonight, but
whether we can work together tomorrow.<p>I believe we
can. I believe we must. That&#x2019;s what the people who sent us
here expect of us. With their votes, they&#x2019;ve determined
that governing will now be a shared responsibility between
parties. New laws will only pass with support from Democrats
and Republicans. We will move forward together, or not at
all &#x2013; for the challenges we face are bigger than party,
and bigger than politics.<p>At stake right now is not
who wins the next election &#x2013; after all, we just had an
election. At stake is whether new jobs and industries take
root in this country, or somewhere else. It&#x2019;s whether the
hard work and industry of our people is rewarded. It&#x2019;s
whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not
just a place on a map, but a light to the world. <p>We
are poised for progress. Two years after the worst recession
most of us have ever known, the stock market has come
roaring back. Corporate profits are up. The economy is
growing again.<p>But we have never measured progress
by these yardsticks alone. We measure progress by the
success of our people. By the jobs they can find and the
quality of life those jobs offer. By the prospects of a
small business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into
a thriving enterprise. By the opportunities for a better
life that we pass on to our children.<p>That&#x2019;s the
project the American people want us to work on.
Together.<p>We did that in December. Thanks to the tax
cuts we passed, Americans&#x2019; paychecks are a little bigger
today. Every business can write off the full cost of the new
investments they make this year. These steps, taken by
Democrats and Republicans, will grow the economy and add to
the more than one million private sector jobs created last
year.<p>But we have more work to do. The steps we&#x2019;ve
taken over the last two years may have broken the back of
this recession &#x2013; but to win the future, we&#x2019;ll need to
take on challenges that have been decades in the making.<p>Many people watching tonight can probably remember a
time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby
factory or a business downtown. You didn&#x2019;t always need a
degree, and your competition was pretty much limited to your
neighbors. If you worked hard, chances are you&#x2019;d have a
job for life, with a decent paycheck, good benefits, and the
occasional promotion. Maybe you&#x2019;d even have the pride of
seeing your kids work at the same company.<p>That
world has changed. And for many, the change has been
painful.  I&#x2019;ve seen it in the shuttered windows of once
booming factories, and the vacant storefronts of once busy
Main Streets. I&#x2019;ve heard it in the frustrations of
Americans who&#x2019;ve seen their paychecks dwindle or their
jobs disappear &#x2013; proud men and women who feel like the
rules have been changed in the middle of the game.<p>They&#x2019;re right. The rules have changed. In a single
generation, revolutions in technology have transformed the
way we live, work and do business. Steel mills that once
needed 1,000 workers can now do the same work with 100. 
Today, just about any company can set up shop, hire workers,
and sell their products wherever there&#x2019;s an internet
connection.<p>Meanwhile, nations like China and India
realized that with some changes of their own, they could
compete in this new world. And so they started educating
their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on
math and science. They&#x2019;re investing in research and new
technologies. Just recently, China became home to the
world&#x2019;s largest private solar research facility, and the
world&#x2019;s fastest computer.<p>So yes, the world has
changed. The competition for jobs is real. But this
shouldn&#x2019;t discourage us. It should challenge us. Remember
&#x2013; for all the hits we&#x2019;ve taken these last few years, for
all the naysayers predicting our decline, America still has
the largest, most prosperous economy in the world. No
workers are more productive than ours. No country has more
successful companies, or grants more patents to inventors
and entrepreneurs. We are home to the world&#x2019;s best
colleges and universities, where more students come to study
than any other place on Earth.<p>What&#x2019;s more, we are
the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea &#x2013;
the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our
own destiny. That is why centuries of pioneers and
immigrants have risked everything to come here.  It&#x2019;s why
our students don&#x2019;t just memorize equations, but answer
questions like &#x201C;What do you think of that idea? What would
you change about the world? What do you want to be when you
grow up?&#x201D;<p>The future is ours to win. But to get
there, we can&#x2019;t just stand still.  As Robert Kennedy told
us, &#x201C;The future is not a gift. It is an achievement.&#x201D;
Sustaining the American Dream has never been about standing
pat. It has required each generation to sacrifice, and
struggle, and meet the demands of a new age.<p>Now
it&#x2019;s our turn. We know what it takes to compete for the
jobs and industries of our time. We need to out-innovate,
out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world. We have to
make America the best place on Earth to do business. We need
to take responsibility for our deficit, and reform our
government. That&#x2019;s how our people will prosper.  That&#x2019;s
how we&#x2019;ll win the future. And tonight, I&#x2019;d like to talk
about how we get there.<p>The first step in winning
the future is encouraging American innovation.<p>None
of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry
will be, or where the new jobs will come from. Thirty years
ago, we couldn&#x2019;t know that something called the Internet
would lead to an economic revolution. What we can do &#x2013;
what America does better than anyone &#x2013; is spark the
creativity and imagination of our people.  We are the nation
that put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the
nation of Edison and the Wright brothers; of Google and
Facebook. In America, innovation doesn&#x2019;t just change our
lives. It&#x2019;s how we make a living.<p>Our free
enterprise system is what drives innovation. But because
it&#x2019;s not always profitable for companies to invest in
basic research, throughout history our government has
provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the
support that they need.  That&#x2019;s what planted the seeds for
the Internet. That&#x2019;s what helped make possible things like
computer chips and GPS.<p>Just think of all the good
jobs &#x2013; from manufacturing to retail &#x2013; that have come
from those breakthroughs.<p>Half a century ago, when
the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a
satellite called Sputnik&#xB8; we had no idea how we&#x2019;d beat
them to the moon. The science wasn&#x2019;t there yet. NASA
didn&#x2019;t even exist.  But after investing in better research
and education, we didn&#x2019;t just surpass the Soviets; we
unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries
and millions of new jobs.<p>This is our generation&#x2019;s
Sputnik moment. Two years ago, I said that we needed to
reach a level of research and development we haven&#x2019;t seen
since the height of the Space Race. In a few weeks, I will
be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that
goal.  We&#x2019;ll invest in biomedical research, information
technology, and especially clean energy technology &#x2013; an
investment that will strengthen our security, protect our
planet, and create countless new jobs for our people.<p>Already, we are seeing the promise of renewable energy.
Robert and Gary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan
roofing company. After September 11th, they volunteered
their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon. But half of
their factory went unused, and the recession hit them
hard.<p>Today, with the help of a government loan,
that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles
that are being sold all across the country. In Robert&#x2019;s
words, &#x201C;We reinvented ourselves.&#x201D;<p>That&#x2019;s what
Americans have done for over two hundred years: reinvented
ourselves. And to spur on more success stories like the
Allen Brothers, we&#x2019;ve begun to reinvent our energy policy.
We&#x2019;re not just handing out money. We&#x2019;re issuing a
challenge.  We&#x2019;re telling America&#x2019;s scientists and
engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in
their fields, and focus on the hardest problems in clean
energy, we&#x2019;ll fund the Apollo Projects of our time.<p>At the California Institute of Technology, they&#x2019;re
developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for
our cars. At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, they&#x2019;re using
supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear
facilities.  With more research and incentives, we can break
our dependence on oil with biofuels, and become the first
country to have 1 million electric vehicles on the road by
2015.<p>We need to get behind this innovation. And to
help pay for it, I&#x2019;m asking Congress to eliminate the
billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil
companies. I don&#x2019;t know if you&#x2019;ve noticed, but they&#x2019;re
doing just fine on their own. So instead of subsidizing
yesterday&#x2019;s energy, let&#x2019;s invest in tomorrow&#x2019;s.<p>Now, clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into
clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market
for what they&#x2019;re selling. So tonight, I challenge you to
join me in setting a new goal: by 2035, 80% of America&#x2019;s
electricity will come from clean energy sources. Some folks
want wind and solar. Others want nuclear, clean coal, and
natural gas. To meet this goal, we will need them all &#x2013;
and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to
make it happen.<p>Maintaining our leadership in
research and technology is crucial to America&#x2019;s success.
But if we want to win the future &#x2013; if we want innovation
to produce jobs in America and not overseas &#x2013; then we also
have to win the race to educate our kids.<p>Think
about it. Over the next ten years, nearly half of all new
jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school
degree. And yet, as many as a quarter of our students
aren&#x2019;t even finishing high school. The quality of our math
and science education lags behind many other nations. 
America has fallen to 9th in the proportion of young people
with a college degree. And so the question is whether all of
us &#x2013; as citizens, and as parents &#x2013; are willing to do
what&#x2019;s necessary to give every child a chance to
succeed.<p>That responsibility begins not in our
classrooms, but in our homes and communities. It&#x2019;s family
that first instills the love of learning in a child. Only
parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets
done.  We need to teach our kids that it&#x2019;s not just the
winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but
the winner of the science fair; that success is not a
function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline.<p>Our schools share this responsibility. When a child
walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high
expectations and high performance. But too many schools
don&#x2019;t meet this test. That&#x2019;s why instead of just pouring
money into a system that&#x2019;s not working, we launched a
competition called Race to the Top.  To all fifty states, we
said, &#x201C;If you show us the most innovative plans to improve
teacher quality and student achievement, we&#x2019;ll show you
the money.&#x201D;<p>Race to the Top is the most meaningful
reform of our public schools in a generation. For less than
one percent of what we spend on education each year, it has
led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and
learning. These standards were developed, not by Washington,
but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the
country.  And Race to the Top should be the approach we
follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a
law that is more flexible and focused on what&#x2019;s best for
our kids.<p>You see, we know what&#x2019;s possible for our
children when reform isn&#x2019;t just a top-down mandate, but
the work of local teachers and principals; school boards and
communities.<p>Take a school like Bruce Randolph in
Denver. Three years ago, it was rated one of the worst
schools in Colorado; located on turf between two rival
gangs. But last May, 97% of the seniors received their
diploma. Most will be the first in their family to go to
college. And after the first year of the school&#x2019;s
transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped
away tears when a student said &#x201C;Thank you, Mrs. Waters,
for showing&#x2026; that we are smart and we can make it.&#x201D;<p>Let&#x2019;s also remember that after parents, the biggest
impact on a child&#x2019;s success comes from the man or woman at
the front of the classroom. In South Korea, teachers are
known as &#x201C;nation builders.&#x201D; Here in America, it&#x2019;s time
we treated the people who educate our children with the same
level of respect. We want to reward good teachers and stop
making excuses for bad ones.  And over the next ten years,
with so many Baby Boomers retiring from our classrooms, we
want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of
science, technology, engineering, and math.<p>In fact,
to every young person listening tonight who&#x2019;s
contemplating their career choice: If you want to make a
difference in the life of our nation; if you want to make a
difference in the life of a child &#x2013; become a teacher. Your
country needs you.<p>Of course, the education race
doesn&#x2019;t end with a high school diploma. To compete, higher
education must be within reach of every American. That&#x2019;s
why we&#x2019;ve ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that
went to banks, and used the savings to make college
affordable for millions of students.  And this year, I ask
Congress to go further, and make permanent our tuition tax
credit &#x2013; worth $10,000 for four years of college. <p>Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and
careers in today&#x2019;s fast-changing economy, we are also
revitalizing America&#x2019;s community colleges. Last month, I
saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North
Carolina. Many of the students there used to work in the
surrounding factories that have since left town. One mother
of two, a woman named Kathy Proctor, had worked in the
furniture industry since she was 18 years old.  And she told
me she&#x2019;s earning her degree in biotechnology now, at 55
years old, not just because the furniture jobs are gone, but
because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their
dreams too. As Kathy said, &#x201C;I hope it tells them to never
give up.&#x201D;<p>If we take these steps &#x2013; if we raise
expectations for every child, and give them the best
possible chance at an education, from the day they&#x2019;re born
until the last job they take &#x2013; we will reach the goal I
set two years ago: by the end of the decade, America will
once again have the highest proportion of college graduates
in the world.<p>One last point about education. Today,
there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our
schools who are not American citizens. Some are the children
of undocumented workers, who had nothing to do with the
actions of their parents. They grew up as Americans and
pledge allegiance to our flag, and yet live every day with
the threat of deportation. Others come here from abroad to
study in our colleges and universities. But as soon as they
obtain advanced degrees, we send them back home to compete
against us. It makes no sense.<p>Now, I strongly
believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue
of illegal immigration. I am prepared to work with
Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders, enforce
our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers
who are now living in the shadows. I know that debate will
be difficult and take time. But tonight, let&#x2019;s agree to
make that effort. And let&#x2019;s stop expelling talented,
responsible young people who can staff our research labs,
start new businesses, and further enrich this nation.<p>The third step in winning the future is rebuilding
America. To attract new businesses to our shores, we need
the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods, and
information &#x2013; from high-speed rail to high-speed
internet.<p>Our infrastructure used to be the best &#x2013;
but our lead has slipped. South Korean homes now have
greater internet access than we do. Countries in Europe and
Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do.
China is building faster trains and newer airports. 
Meanwhile, when our own engineers graded our nation&#x2019;s
infrastructure, they gave us a &#x201C;D.&#x201D;<p>We have to
do better. America is the nation that built the
transcontinental railroad, brought electricity to rural
communities, and constructed the interstate highway system.
The jobs created by these projects didn&#x2019;t just come from
laying down tracks or pavement. They came from businesses
that opened near a town&#x2019;s new train station or the new
off-ramp.<p>Over the last two years, we have begun
rebuilding for the 21st century, a project that has meant
thousands of good jobs for the hard-hit construction
industry. Tonight, I&#x2019;m proposing that we redouble these
efforts.<p>We will put more Americans to work
repairing crumbling roads and bridges. We will make sure
this is fully paid for, attract private investment, and pick
projects based on what&#x2019;s best for the economy, not
politicians.<p>Within 25 years, our goal is to give
80% of Americans access to high-speed rail, which could
allow you go places in half the time it takes to travel by
car. For some trips, it will be faster than flying &#x2013;
without the pat-down. As we speak, routes in California and
the Midwest are already underway.<p>Within the next
five years, we will make it possible for business to deploy
the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to 98%
of all Americans. This isn&#x2019;t just about a faster internet
and fewer dropped calls. It&#x2019;s about connecting every part
of America to the digital age.  It&#x2019;s about a rural
community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small
business owners will be able to sell their products all over
the world. It&#x2019;s about a firefighter who can download the
design of a burning building onto a handheld device; a
student who can take classes with a digital textbook; or a
patient who can have face-to-face video chats with her
doctor.<p>All these investments &#x2013; in innovation,
education, and infrastructure &#x2013; will make America a better
place to do business and create jobs.  But to help our
companies compete, we also have to knock down barriers that
stand in the way of their success.<p>Over the years, a
parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit
particular companies and industries. Those with accountants
or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at
all. But all the rest are hit with one of the highest
corporate tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and it
has to change.<p>So tonight, I&#x2019;m asking Democrats
and Republicans to simplify the system. Get rid of the
loopholes. Level the playing field. And use the savings to
lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years
&#x2013; without adding to our deficit.<p>To help
businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of
doubling our exports by 2014 &#x2013; because the more we export,
the more jobs we create at home. Already, our exports are
up. Recently, we signed agreements with India and China that
will support more than 250,000 jobs in the United States. 
And last month, we finalized a trade agreement with South
Korea that will support at least 70,000 American jobs. This
agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor;
Democrats and Republicans, and I ask this Congress to pass
it as soon as possible.<p>Before I took office, I made
it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements, and
that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American
workers, and promote American jobs.  That&#x2019;s what we did
with Korea, and that&#x2019;s what I intend to do as we pursue
agreements with Panama and Colombia, and continue our Asia
Pacific and global trade talks.<p>To reduce barriers
to growth and investment, I&#x2019;ve ordered a review of
government regulations. When we find rules that put an
unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them. But I
will not hesitate to create or enforce commonsense
safeguards to protect the American people.  That&#x2019;s what
we&#x2019;ve done in this country for more than a century. It&#x2019;s
why our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and
our air is safe to breathe. It&#x2019;s why we have speed limits
and child labor laws.  It&#x2019;s why last year, we put in place
consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by
credit card companies, and new rules to prevent another
financial crisis. And it&#x2019;s why we passed reform that
finally prevents the health insurance industry from
exploiting patients.<p>Now, I&#x2019;ve heard rumors that a
few of you have some concerns about the new health care law.
So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved.
If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making
care better or more affordable, I am eager to work with you.
We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the
legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping
burden on small businesses.<p>What I&#x2019;m not willing
to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could
deny someone coverage because of a pre-existing condition. 
I&#x2019;m not willing to tell James Howard, a brain cancer
patient from Texas, that his treatment might not be covered.
I&#x2019;m not willing to tell Jim Houser, a small business owner
from Oregon, that he has to go back to paying $5,000 more to
cover his employees.  As we speak, this law is making
prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured
students a chance to stay on their parents&#x2019; coverage. So
instead of re-fighting the battles of the last two years,
let&#x2019;s fix what needs fixing and move forward.<p>Now,
the final step &#x2013; a critical step &#x2013; in winning the future
is to make sure we aren&#x2019;t buried under a mountain of
debt.<p>We are living with a legacy of
deficit-spending that began almost a decade ago. And in the
wake of the financial crisis, some of that was necessary to
keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in people&#x2019;s
pockets.<p>But now that the worst of the recession is
over, we have to confront the fact that our government
spends more than it takes in. That is not sustainable. 
Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means.
They deserve a government that does the same.<p>So
tonight, I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze
annual domestic spending for the next five years. This would
reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next
decade, and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest
share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was
president.<p>This freeze will require painful cuts.
Already, we have frozen the salaries of hardworking federal
employees for the next two years.  I&#x2019;ve proposed cuts to
things I care deeply about, like community action programs.
The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of
billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals
believe our military can do without.<p>I recognize
that some in this Chamber have already proposed deeper cuts,
and I&#x2019;m willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly
afford to do without. But let&#x2019;s make sure that we&#x2019;re not
doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.  And
let&#x2019;s make sure what we&#x2019;re cutting is really excess
weight. Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in
innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded
airplane by removing its engine. It may feel like you&#x2019;re
flying high at first, but it won&#x2019;t take long before
you&#x2019;ll feel the impact.<p>Now, most of the cuts and
savings I&#x2019;ve proposed only address annual domestic
spending, which represents a little more than 12% of our
budget. To make further progress, we have to stop pretending
that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough. It
won&#x2019;t.<p>The bipartisan Fiscal Commission I created
last year made this crystal clear I don&#x2019;t agree with all
their proposals, but they made important progress. And their
conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to
cut excessive spending wherever we find it &#x2013; in domestic
spending, defense spending, health care spending, and
spending through tax breaks and loopholes.<p>This
means further reducing health care costs, including programs
like Medicare and Medicaid, which are the single biggest
contributor to our long-term deficit.  Health insurance
reform will slow these rising costs, which is part of why
nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health
care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our
deficit. Still, I&#x2019;m willing to look at other ideas to
bring down costs, including one that Republicans suggested
last year: medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous
lawsuits.<p>To put us on solid ground, we should also
find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for
future generations.  And we must do it without putting at
risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or people with
disabilities; without slashing benefits for future
generations; and without subjecting Americans&#x2019; guaranteed
retirement income to the whims of the stock market.<p>And if we truly care about our deficit, we simply cannot
afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the
wealthiest 2% of Americans. Before we take money away from
our schools, or scholarships away from our students, we
should ask millionaires to give up their tax break.<p>It&#x2019;s not a matter of punishing their success. It&#x2019;s
about promoting America&#x2019;s success.<p>In fact, the
best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to
simplify the individual tax code. This will be a tough job,
but members of both parties have expressed interest in doing
this, and I am prepared to join them.<p>So now is the
time to act. Now is the time for both sides and both houses
of Congress &#x2013; Democrats and Republicans &#x2013; to forge a
principled compromise that gets the job done.  If we make
the hard choices now to rein in our deficits, we can make
the investments we need to win the future.<p>Let me
take this one step further. We shouldn&#x2019;t just give our
people a government that&#x2019;s more affordable. We should give
them a government that&#x2019;s more competent and efficient. We
cannot win the future with a government of the past.<p>We live and do business in the information age, but the
last major reorganization of the government happened in the
age of black and white TV.  There are twelve different
agencies that deal with exports. There are at least five
different entities that deal with housing policy. Then
there&#x2019;s my favorite example: the Interior Department is in
charge of salmon while they&#x2019;re in fresh water, but the
Commerce Department handles them in when they&#x2019;re in
saltwater. And I hear it gets even more complicated once
they&#x2019;re smoked.<p>Now, we have made great strides
over the last two years in using technology and getting rid
of waste. Veterans can now download their electronic medical
records with a click of the mouse.  We&#x2019;re selling acres of
federal office space that hasn&#x2019;t been used in years, and
we will cut through red tape to get rid of more. But we need
to think bigger.  In the coming months, my administration
will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and
reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves
the goal of a more competitive America. I will submit that
proposal to Congress for a vote &#x2013; and we will push to get
it passed.<p>In the coming year, we will also work to
rebuild people&#x2019;s faith in the institution of government. 
Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax
dollars are being spent, you will be able to go to a website
and get that information for the very first time in history.
Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are
meeting with lobbyists, I ask Congress to do what the White
House has already done: put that information online.  And
because the American people deserve to know that special
interests aren&#x2019;t larding up legislation with pet projects,
both parties in Congress should know this: if a bill comes
to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it.<p>A
21st century government that&#x2019;s open and competent. A
government that lives within its means. An economy that&#x2019;s
driven by new skills and ideas. Our success in this new and
changing world will require reform, responsibility, and
innovation. It will also require us to approach that world
with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs.<p>Just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders,
so can new threats and new challenges. No single wall
separates East and West; no one rival superpower is aligned
against us.<p>And so we must defeat determined enemies
wherever they are, and build coalitions that cut across
lines of region and race and religion. America&#x2019;s moral
example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom,
justice, and dignity. And because we have begun this work,
tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed
and America&#x2019;s standing has been restored.<p>Look to
Iraq, where nearly 100,000 of our brave men and women have
left with their heads held high; where American combat
patrols have ended; violence has come down; and a new
government has been formed. This year, our civilians will
forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people, while we
finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq.
America&#x2019;s commitment has been kept; the Iraq War is coming
to an end.<p>Of course, as we speak, al Qaeda and
their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us. 
Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement
professionals, we are disrupting plots and securing our
cities and skies And as extremists try to inspire acts of
violence within our borders, we are responding with the
strength of our communities, with respect for the rule of
law, and with the conviction that American Muslims are a
part of our American family.   <p>We have also taken
the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad. In
Afghanistan, our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and
trained Afghan Security Forces.  Our purpose is clear &#x2013; by
preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold
over the Afghan people, we will deny al Qaeda the safe-haven
that served as a launching pad for 9/11.<p>Thanks to
our heroic troops and civilians, fewer Afghans are under the
control of the insurgency. There will be tough fighting
ahead, and the Afghan government will need to deliver better
governance. But we are strengthening the capacity of the
Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with
them.  This year, we will work with nearly 50 countries to
begin a transition to an Afghan lead. And this July, we will
begin to bring our troops home.<p>In Pakistan, al
Qaeda&#x2019;s leadership is under more pressure than at any
point since 2001. Their leaders and operatives are being
removed from the battlefield. Their safe-havens are
shrinking. And we have sent a message from the Afghan border
to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe: we will
not relent, we will not waver, and we will defeat you.<p>American leadership can also be seen in the effort to
secure the worst weapons of war. Because Republicans and
Democrats approved the New START Treaty, far fewer nuclear
weapons and launchers will be deployed. Because we rallied
the world, nuclear materials are being locked down on every
continent so they never fall into the hands of
terrorists.<p>Because of a diplomatic effort to insist
that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian government now
faces tougher and tighter sanctions than ever before. And on
the Korean peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea,
and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon
nuclear weapons.<p>This is just a part of how we are
shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity. With our
European allies, we revitalized NATO, and increased our
cooperation on everything from counter-terrorism to missile
defense.  We have reset our relationship with Russia,
strengthened Asian alliances, and built new partnerships
with nations like India. This March, I will travel to
Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador to forge new alliances for
progress in the Americas. Around the globe, we are standing
with those who take responsibility &#x2013; helping farmers grow
more food; supporting doctors who care for the sick; and
combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob
people of opportunity.<p>Recent events have shown us
that what sets us apart must not just be our power &#x2013; it
must be the purpose behind it.  In South Sudan &#x2013; with our
assistance &#x2013; the people were finally able to vote for
independence after years of war Thousands lined up before
dawn. People danced in the streets. One man who lost four of
his brothers at war summed up the scene around him: &#x201C;This
was a battlefield for most of my life. Now we want to be
free.&#x201D;<p>We saw that same desire to be free in
Tunisia, where the will of the people proved more powerful
than the writ of a dictator. And tonight, let us be clear:
the United States of America stands with the people of
Tunisia, and supports the democratic aspirations of all
people.<p>We must never forget that the things we&#x2019;ve
struggled for, and fought for, live in the hearts of people
everywhere. And we must always remember that the Americans
who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the
men and women who serve our country.<p>Tonight, let us
speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is
united in support of our troops and their families.  Let us
serve them as well as they have served us &#x2013; by giving them
the equipment they need; by providing them with the care and
benefits they have earned; and by enlisting our veterans in
the great task of building our own nation.<p>Our
troops come from every corner of this country &#x2013; they are
black, white, Latino, Asian and Native American. They are
Christian and Hindu, Jewish and Muslim. And, yes, we know
that some of them are gay. Starting this year, no American
will be forbidden from serving the country they love because
of who they love.  And with that change, I call on all of
our college campuses to open their doors to our military
recruiters and the ROTC. It is time to leave behind the
divisive battles of the past. It is time to move forward as
one nation.<p>We should have no illusions about the
work ahead of us. Reforming our schools; changing the way we
use energy; reducing our deficit &#x2013; none of this is easy.
All of it will take time. And it will be harder because we
will argue about everything. The cost. The details. The
letter of every law.<p>Of course, some countries
don&#x2019;t have this problem. If the central government wants a
railroad, they get a railroad &#x2013; no matter how many homes
are bulldozed. If they don&#x2019;t want a bad story in the
newspaper, it doesn&#x2019;t get written.<p>And yet, as
contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can
sometimes be, I know there isn&#x2019;t a person here who would
trade places with any other nation on Earth.<p>We may
have differences in policy, but we all believe in the rights
enshrined in our Constitution. We may have different
opinions, but we believe in the same promise that says this
is a place where you can make it if you try. We may have
different backgrounds, but we believe in the same dream that
says this is a country where anything&#x2019;s possible. No
matter who you are. No matter where you come from.<p>That dream is why I can stand here before you tonight.
That dream is why a working class kid from Scranton can
stand behind me.  That dream is why someone who began by
sweeping the floors of his father&#x2019;s Cincinnati bar can
preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on
Earth.<p>That dream &#x2013; that American Dream &#x2013; is
what drove the Allen Brothers to reinvent their roofing
company for a new era. It&#x2019;s what drove those students at
Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the
future. And that dream is the story of a small business
owner named Brandon Fisher.<p>Brandon started a
company in Berlin, Pennsylvania that specializes in a new
kind of drilling technology. One day last summer, he saw the
news that halfway across the world, 33 men were trapped in a
Chilean mine, and no one knew how to save them.<p>But
Brandon thought his company could help. And so he designed a
rescue that would come to be known as Plan B. His employees
worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary
drilling equipment. And Brandon left for Chile.<p>Along with others, he began drilling a 2,000 foot hole
into the ground, working three or four days at a time with
no sleep. Thirty-seven days later, Plan B succeeded, and the
miners were rescued. But because he didn&#x2019;t want all of the
attention, Brandon wasn&#x2019;t there when the miners emerged.
He had already gone home, back to work on his next
project.<p>Later, one of his employees said of the
rescue, &#x201C;We proved that Center Rock is a little company,
but we do big things.&#x201D;<p>We do big things.<p>From the earliest days of our founding, America has been
the story of ordinary people who dare to dream. That&#x2019;s how
we win the future.<p>We are a nation that says, &#x201C;I
might not have a lot of money, but I have this great idea
for a new company. I might not come from a family of college
graduates, but I will be the first to get my degree. I might
not know those people in trouble, but I think I can help
them, and I need to try. I&#x2019;m not sure how we&#x2019;ll reach
that better place beyond the horizon, but I know we&#x2019;ll get
there. I know we will.&#x201D;<p>We do big things.<p>The idea of America endures. Our destiny remains our
choice. And tonight, more than two centuries later, it is
because of our people that our future is hopeful, our
journey goes forward, and the state of our union is
strong.<p>Thank you, God Bless You, and may God Bless
the United States of America. <p>ENDS<br>

The events of that spring day are explored in this short film which intersperses archive footage with a fictional account of workers and customers in the tailoring department as the dramas of everyday life are suddenly overwhelmed. It was directed by Aileen O&rsquo;Sullivan, shot by Alun Bollinger and made with the NZ Drama School graduating class of 2002 (with music by Gareth Farr)." height="40" width="42"> Spring Flames</a> 17 Dec- Short Film, 2003</li><p>

Aucklanders Peter and Laura meet up with their Wellington friend Rangi and his older cousin Dan (Wi Kuki Kaa), and go on an expedition to Kapiti Island. The trio (minus Dan, who has a sprained ankle) go bush for some kids vs. wild action, peppered with a menagerie of manu (kÃÂkÃÂ, weka, kererÃÂ«, tui), and tales of Te Rauparaha, whaling and ghosts. They camp, fish, skylark around cliffs and caves, summit the island, and inevitably get lost, before ... getting safely home." height="40" width="42"> The Island</a> 15 Dec- Television, 1961</li><p>

Pitched at gay and straight alike, the pair's lighthearted but occasionally troubled romance features extensive footage of central Auckland circa 1988 (courtesy of director Garth Maxwell&rsquo;s own central Queen Street digs), plus imagery of space &mdash; for Richard a place of both beauty and potential disaster.

The programme was made in 1984 when PÃÂkehÃÂ were generally less familiar with visiting marae, so host Ian Johnstone presents the documentary from the perspective of a person rather more apprehensive about marae protocol than might be the case in 2011. That aside, the doco remains an effective primer for 21st Century marae novices." height="40" width="42"> The Beginner&#39;s Guide to Visiting the Marae</a> 14 Dec- Television, 1984</li><p>

Roused from the Winter Gardens, an exterminator and his giant caged owl come to the rescue! The promo was one of several that Crystal Bear-winning short film director Sam (Manurewa) Peacocke shot for The Mint Chicks.

Since then, Burger has directed numerous film and television productions, including Until Proven Innocent, which won five Qantas awards in 2009, The Tattooist, Fish Skin Suit, short film Turangawaewae, staring the late Wi Kuki Kaa, as well as the TV series Outrageous Fortune, Go Girls and The Cult." height="40" width="42"> Peter Burger on calling the shots</a> 14 Dec- ScreenTalk, 2011</li><p>
