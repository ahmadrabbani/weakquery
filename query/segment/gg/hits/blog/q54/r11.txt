 Purina Beggin strips need to be taken off the market

 HOME  Dog Food Blog  About Best Dog Food Guide  E-zine “Houndbytes”  Members  FAQ  Contact Me       Purina Beggin strips need to be taken off the market by anonymous   My small dog was killed by a product called  Beggin strips . It did this over time not the first time I ever gave it. This item needs to be removed off the shelves asap. Don't believe what I say, no problem, go and test the product yourself. Like I said it is a loop in the system.  Beggin strips will not kill your dog over night or by giving it once, but if you give it daily over time it will cause your dog serious problems and even death.  As of the many products that get through our government, if you have ever seen commercials on TV where the lawyer goes "If you have taken such and such product, call us now" it is the same type of premise.  The government does not test these product for people or dogs well enough. Thus we go into a store, see something on a shelf, assume that its safe and next things you know a person or pet is dead.  Want to know one of the most things that kill people (and I am sure animals as well), it's over prescribed drugs/medication.  The night my dog died he looked like he was overdosed. Anyone I have talked to about this product says their dog goes nuts for this product, almost like an addiction.  One person even wrote me saying that their dog didn't even want to go outside to the bathroom without a piece of a Beggin strip.  They then went to the vet and found out the product caused their pet major interior damage and they had to have the dog operated on. Do you want the photos of what they took out of the dog? They actually emailed it to me.  The thing that also bothers me greatly is in my area even after I let Purina know about the problem, Purina continues to run daily  commercials for Beggin strips .  Can you imagine my feeling watching TV and seeing this commercial, IT IS DESPICABLE. So as I see you are probably someone who cares a lot about people and animals versus company profits and government foul ups, I hope you will do whatever you can to get this product off the shelves.  This product will kill you dog especially if they are under 10-15 lbs. Over time, and there is no doubt about it.

You shouldn't give ONE piece to your animal. I'm disgusted stuff like this is made cause people are not clued in enough to even know how bad it is. The deception of commercials. If you love your pet you will give a healthy treat. I wouldn't let my animals eat one 'strip' of this crap even if I was given it for free. I would not even give it away. It's SH#T.        Sep 18, 2011  It's called a "TREAT" for a reason  by: Anonymous  Um, WHY would you feed your dog a treat everyday? That's like having an ice cream cone or a candy bar everyday. It's called a treat for a reason. Sorry for your loss, but I doubt the strips did it. Maybe over indulgence in a food that isn't meant to be consumed daily?        Sep 09, 2011  Read the ingredients before buying dog food and dog treats  by: canine care  This stuff is a fast track to cancer and other diseases. So are many other products like it.  People need to read the  ingredients before buying any food or treat.  Also research products on the web before buying.  The info is out there. Just look first buy second. Two of the great websites out there with info are:  Canine Care and  Dog Food Project .         Jul 17, 2011  Feed different treats your dog and limit them  by: Anonymous  My dogs always have a Beggin Strip after they have been outside or they have done something good. If your dog is under 10 pounds then why even give them these treats everyday? My dogs have one each day or they have a different kind of treat and they are both perfectly fine. The vet says they are in perfect condition. I am truly sorry for your loss but this dog died either from other causes or you fed it WAY too many treats.        Mar 01, 2011  My dog died from Lymphoma after eating Beggin strips daily  by: Anonymous  My dog was a healthy Chihuahua that was 5 lbs and I began feeding her Beggin strips about a year ago and both of my dogs loved them.  Well in December she was diagnosed with Lymphoma and we had to put her down in January. I could not figure out what happened to her. She was only 4 years old and then I started researching the dyes that are in those Beggin strips.  It contains 3 of the cancer causing dyes so now I am sure that I lost my poor Baby to cancer because of those darned "treats" that are filled with cancer causing dyes. What sickens me is that those dyes have been studied and caused cancer in lab rats and the government allows them to use it in dog treats.  I AM SICKENED and I miss my precious Baby. I hate myself for not being more careful about what I fed her, I feel so guilty.  DO NOT FEED YOUR PETS THESE TREATS UNLESS YOU WANT TO WATCH THEM SUFFER A HORRIBLE DEATH!!!!        Dec 24, 2010  Need more data  by: Barbara  Hi, you didn't fill out your name or email address but if you are reading this the vet story might be helpful in elucidating what happened to that dog. What exactly was found when the dog was operated? And which problem points to a relation to the specific dog treat? It's not about believing the story or not, it's about gathering objective evidence. And of course not via testing as you suggested. In just one case there are so many variables to consider. It's difficult to find a correlation, let alone a causality. We really need that vet's opinion on this. I've asked Purina to comment on your story. That said, I do feel sorry for you loss. I hope your dog had a very happy life with you and that you have lots of happy memories of your life together. For now, just zap away when you see those commercials.
