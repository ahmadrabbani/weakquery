By:  Watcher3223. on 09 Feb 09, 07:51:28 But, in all practicality, actually using the two SH-2 processors in the Saturn to their fullest in limited parallel mode was difficult. A scenario that can occur with improperly programmed code is that both processors do tasks but one processor finishes before the other, so what happens is that the processor that finishes has to wait for the other processor to catch up before it can start working again.

By:  jbond5150. on 18 Feb 11, 23:24:49 @devry187 nope. but ill tell you this: i hired a lot of people over the course of my career and one thing i found was that young adults coming out of community colleges, on average, had significantly better levels of education than those coming from DeVry, or Western Career College, or U of Phoenix, or any of these degree mills. they were definitely more articulate. I am warning you: get a degree from DeVry and NOBODY will take you seriously, i dont care how good you feel the program might be.   i go to devry cause ...

If you think you are going to go to Devry to become a real engineer, you are lying to yourself. Engineering is a hard discipline. You are more of a technician. However, DeVry can get you into the door and after a few years, you can become a traditional engineer.  DeVry is not an ivy ... By:  devry187. on 25 Apr 09, 21:39:18 DeVry is not an ivy league school but it doesn't claim to be. If you want the traditional college experience, go to a different school.

By:  desertflower08. on 24 Apr 09, 15:39:46 devry187: You must work for DeVry to be so loyal. Their recruiter? From the other comments also, its apparent DeVry does not offer a dependable education in all their locations. In fact their are numerous complaints on the Internet that I found recently that reflect how DeVry misled many students, stole grants & then make students to pay for the substandard education DeVry delivers. Not good business practice. Fact: Today's job market is ever so dependent on a high standard education.  Whether they do or ... By:  desertflower08. on 24 Apr 09, 15:20:26 Whether they do or don't now. Still Not Right to Deceive Potential Students looking for a dependable education needed in todays job market. Their recruiters purposely lie since their job is at stake. DeVry will always run as Business working on Profits 1st so their executives can retain their 6-figure salaries. Many DeVry locations dont have the essential elements to provide the high level education they promise in their ads. Fact: American businesses have corrupt laws protecting them.

By:  agentbl. on 10 Mar 09, 13:55:19 I understand what you're sying and it's very credible. My DeVry school is good enough for me. They've upgraded the computers and softwares in my school. It is in no way crappy at all. It's really good. Not the best, but at least one of the best schools in New York. I love my school and plan to graduate from it. I understand that this school isn't for everyone. I've always wanted to go to DeVry and now that I'm there, I want to finish. I don't care about honors, I just want to graduate.  agentbl. Others are ... By:  desertflower08. on 10 Mar 09, 13:39:34 agentbl. Others are fed up since many locations don't have skilled instructors needed & have broken down equipment where students have to take turns. Public high schools are better equipped these days. Some students had to re-take courses at local colleges to finish their DeVry degrees & then have 2 tuition payments when DeVry offers low skilled instructors that don't teach the course essentials. Not all DeVry's run so crappy but MANY of them DO to save money as theyre a business first.  I never said that ... By:  agentbl. on 10 Mar 09, 13:38:51 I never said that all DeVry's are the same. But what they should do is teach ALL students everything they can and give them the best educations possible to compete in the job markets of the future. And you do make a good point about misleading recruiters who are just out to get their commissions or bonuses. I'm sure that my recruiter wouldn't do that to me. I hope not. Not all schools are perfect, even DeVry. It's what we make of it and I intend to make the best of my school, which is DeVry, NY.  agentbl...Not all ... By:  desertflower08. on 10 Mar 09, 13:30:46 agentbl...Not all DeVry's are the same. Some are alright but many reputable big corporations will not hire from DeVry graduates since they don't feel they got the higher education needed in today's high demanding fields. Some DeVry recruiters will tell you the truth but most just want their commission or bonus they get for enrolling as many people as they can that walk through their doors. Just Watch your finances very closely since DeVry has a multitude of screw-ups working there.  DeVry executives ...

DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE-LONG DREAM ON A BELOW STANDARD EDUCATION AT DEVRY. THEIR GOALS ARE FOR BUSINESS PROFITS ONLY & NOT AN EDUCATION YOU NEED TO SUCCEED. Check out local reputable corporations that don't hire DeVry graduates & then ask them why! That should tell you a little about DeVry's reputation. !
