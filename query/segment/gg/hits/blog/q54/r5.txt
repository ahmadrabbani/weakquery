I ordered this for my grandpuppy, Gizmo. She's my daughter's 4 yr old Puggle. She just loves these treats. She loves their whole line of treats. Just like anything that you give your pet as a treat you have to be careful not to indulge or you'll have a fatty on your lap. LOL great product & she loves them and is always looking for more.       5      By chihuahuamom06 on    - Feb 14, 2011 -  See More Reviews from petco.com  Another Smooth Transaction  I was lured with a January coupon along with their discount so I took advantage of ordering online Beggin' Strips as my dog loves them. The first bag did not last long and these were an excellent buy! Sorry the store closest to me closed and that I have to go long way to Baltimore area, but at least there is online ordering. Thank you Petco, pleasure doing business with you.       3      By aussiegirl1 on    - Dec 14, 2010 -  See More Reviews from petco.com  Dogs Like the Taste, NOT Healthy  While my dogs loved these Beggin Strips when I purchased them a little while ago, I took a look and the ingredients and will never feed them again! I would not recommend this product to a friend.       5      By missygirl5 on    - May 4, 2010 -  See More Reviews from petco.com  GREAT DOG SNACKS  MY DOGS CANT GET ENOUGH BEGGIN STRIPS! THEY LOVE THEM!       2      By BellasMommy09 on    - Jan 18, 2010 -  See More Reviews from petco.com  She hates it  My Bella hates the Beggin Strips. I tried to give them as a treat for training and she has absolutely no interest in them whatsoever. I'd like to think it's because she has never smelled bacon or had people food so this just doesn't appeal to her.       3      By PuppyLove5 on    - Apr 17, 2009 -  See More Reviews from petco.com  He likes them but they're smelly!  My dog really likes these treats but boy are they smelly! You will KNOW when he's eaten them or if you've left the bag open. My husband sneaks them to the pup all the time and I can instantly tell from the stinky bacon breath!       5      By sillymonkey on    - Apr 11, 2009 -  See More Reviews from petco.com  It's the BEST Treat EVER!  This is perfect. My dog looovvveess these AWESOME BACON treats. She dosen't beg under the table at breakfast anymore!

HAHA!!       5      By lakismom on    - May 22, 2008 -  See More Reviews from petco.com  Dogs go nuts for these  My dog goes nuts every time i go to the pantry and open a bag of these. He loves them so much. They are little big so I always break them into small pieces and use it for training or just as a treat.       5      By TinysDad on    - Feb 12, 2008 -  See More Reviews from petco.com  Her FAVORITE  This treat is by far a favorite of our little, 8 pound Chihuahua. She goes nuts for these, we rarely buy anything else.    View More User Reviews    Sponsored Links  15% Off  Beggin Strips Now  Save 15% Off  Beggin Strips Today.
