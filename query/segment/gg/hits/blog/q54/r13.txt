 Monika vs. Heidelberg: The Night My Suite Smelled Like Beggin Strips

                                   Monika vs. Heidelberg                                                             Sunday, May 29, 2011   The Night My Suite Smelled Like Beggin Strips    which is does. and I don't know why or how.  AND THERE ARE FIREWORKS RIGHT NOW, RIGHT OUTSIDE MY WINDOW. and I don't know why, but it makes the best day ever (which today was and I apparently say that in my sleep) even better Anyway notable occurrences of the past 3ish weeks:  Banana Bread  Long bike rides to castles and up mountains and picnics on ruins Lacrosse Being asked to be a Magicians Assistant at my internship  the bruises the color of rainbows all over my legs  History class mohawks I got lost in the woods on a mountain by myself and ended up finding a hospital and field of cows.  Concert where hipsters were dressed to impress. and they did impress.  The birth of Bake Crew and surprise birthday party on the Neckarwiese.  Parents came to Germany for the start of Hayleck Family vs Germany.    The parents arrived and after I lost them for approximately 2 to 3 hours, I finally met up with them in the hotel. From that point on, the sights of Heidelberg were seen and the planes to Berlin were flown. Despite only 1 day of sunshine in Berlin, it is a giant of a city and supa interesting. Dad was reunited with Berlin after 35 years and a new Berlin was experienced by the parents and me.  The Brandenburger Tor was touched, the Wall was walked along, the Berliner Dom was awed at, Bunkers were explored, art was looked at (mostly by me), and food was eaten (thanks Mom and Dad!).  My favorite thing about Berlin: East Side Gallery. My least favorite thing about Berlin: everyone thought I was 17. But Berlin is best experienced via photos:     Victory statue I forget the name of         Tor        East side Gallery               Berliner Dom        Dom        Schloß Charlottenburg         Schloß Garten        Stumble Stones on the street, in front of buildings, marking where the Jewish were last seen        hello parents and Heidelberg    and so I leave you with this: ...shaking the body until it quivers like a disturbed glass of jello is not only tremendously suggestive, but it is an offense to common decency that would not be permitted in a semi-respectable road house. that quote has no relevance to modern day life, nor has it any significance to my life other than I found it a) commical and b) in a newspaper article, that described the "new youth" and dance moves circa May 1921, which I read at my internship earlier this week.  also, the firework show is RIGHT NOW, having its finale and it is awesome    Posted by  Monika   at   1:32 PM             Email This    BlogThis!
