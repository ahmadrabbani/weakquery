A spokesperson of Marvel Studios, said, “We have decided not to take Ed Norton again to reprise the character of Bruce Banner or the Hulk in The Avengers, a sequel of The Incredible Hulk. The decision is not taken for financial reasons but for taking an actor who can represent the creativity and collaborative spirit of the other talented cast members”. He added, “The movie demands actors, who can flourish working as part of a group, as proved by Chris H, Chris E, Robert Scarlett, Sam and our entire talented cast. We will be announcing a name, who is very passionate about this iconic role and can fulfill all the other requirements. We will decide on the name in the coming weeks”. There is already a name of actor doing the rounds to play the role of Bruce Banner. Some sources have revealed that Joaquin Phoenix has been offered by Marvel to step into the role. Reacting on this news of his replacement, Edward Norton said, “I am very touched by the response and support from my fans. I hoped to be a part of The Avenger but it would not happen probably. I feel sad to disappoint the fans”. With a new face of Hulk, the reaction of the audience would be interesting to watch! –Sampurn Wire     Tweet  Related Stories No Ed Norton in 'The Incredible Hulk' sequel - Jul 12, 2010 Marvel Studios to replace Ed Norton in 'The Avengers' - Jul 12, 2010 Norton slams studio for ruling him out of 'Hulk' sequel - Jul 13, 2010 Edward Norton ditched from 'Avengers' for not being team player - Jul 13, 2010 Mark Ruffalo is the new 'Incredible Hulk' - Jul 27, 2010 Mark Ruffalo in 'late-stage talks' to star as 'The Hulk' - Jul 15, 2010 Ruffalo thrilled to play Hulk - Oct 17, 2010 Edward Norton may return as The Hulk - Aug 05, 2009 I didn't want to do 'Captain America': Evans - Jun 09, 2011 The Incredible Hulk To Scorch Silver Screen Once Again - Sep 26, 2010 Jeremy Renner To Play Hawkeye In "The Avengers" - Jul 24, 2010 'Thor' - Hollywood extravaganza at its shiniest best (IANS Movie Review) - Apr 29, 2011 Mark Ruffalo Playing Hulk In 'The Avengers', Confirmed - Jul 25, 2010 Guillermo Del Toro Making Hulk TV Series - Nov 17, 2010 David Tennant to play 'The Incredible Hulk'? - Jul 17, 2010  Tags:  actor edward norton ,  actors ,  avenger ,  avengers ,  bruce banner ,  cast members ,  collaborative spirit ,  creativity ,  doing the rounds ,  ed norton ,  edward norton ,  hollywood actor ,  hulk ,  incredible hulk ,  joaquin phoenix ,  marvel studios ,  new face ,  scarlett ,  sequel ,  spokesperson   Posted in  Entertainment  |        Leave a Comment   Name   Mail (will not be published)   Website      Please note: Comment moderation is enabled and may delay your comment.
