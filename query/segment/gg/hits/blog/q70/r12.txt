The Associated Press   Related Search restaurants and bars  Entertainment RSS feed    LOS ANGELES —  Ed Norton is speaking out on Facebook after Marvel Studios announced last week that the actor won't reprise his Hulk role in its forthcoming "Avengers" film. Norton says he took to the social-networking site Monday because he felt it would be rude not to respond to an outpouring of support from fans. Following Marvel president Kevin Feige's announcement Saturday that the studio would replace Norton with "an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members," Norton apologized to fans that "it won't work out" for him to play Bruce Banner again, adding he is proud of his work in the "Hulk" film and grateful to the studio for the opportunity to play the part. Marvel had no comment Tuesday.      What's this?
