Byline: Rebecca Traister  When he finishes his run in the Off Broadway revival of Burn This in November, Edward Norton will report to the Los Angeles set of F. Gary Gray's heist movie The Italian Job, which will co-star Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron. Mr. Norton may show up on time, but he won't be happy about it. According to sources familiar with the situation, Mr. Norton has agreed to do the movie only to avoid being sued by Paramount Pictures, the studio that gave him his start.  Mr. Norton's appearance in Mr. Gray's film marks the culmination of a quiet but corrosive five-year contractual dispute between the actor and Paramount Pictures' Motion Picture Group chairman Sherry Lansing that recalls days when a more powerful studio system held its actors in choke holds.  Rob Friedman, C.O.O. and vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, told The Transom that Mr. Norton is "working happily and professionally" on The Italian Job, but confirmed that the actor took the role because it was "a contractual obligation" to the studio that "[went] out on a limb and [took] a chance" on him early in his career. Mr. Norton declined to comment for this article, but one of his attorneys, litigator Marty Singer, said that although Mr. Norton has decided not to enter into litigation with the studio, he feels that he was betrayed and lied to by Paramount executives.  Other film-industry sources said that the actor is furious at having been forced into the role, and that Ms. Lansing--who also declined to comment on this story--has won a small but crucial industry battle pertaining to the leverage that talent can wield over studios.  Mr. Norton's relationship with Paramount began in 1995 when the actor made his screen debut in the courtroom drama Primal Fear, which the studio produced. The actor's contract stipulated that he would be obligated to make two future movies for Paramount following the release of Primal Fear. He would be paid $75,000 for the first and approximately $125,000 for the second. Such stipulations are common in the film industry and ensure that a studio taking a chance on unproven talent will have the opportunity to cash in later should the actor connect with movie audiences.  Mr. Norton connected quicker than most, winning a Golden Globe and scoring an Oscar nomination for his Primal Fear performance. Soon he had been cast in Milos Forman's The People vs. Larry Flynt, which was distributed by Columbia Pictures, and was dating his co-star, Courtney Love. He took roles in Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You, for Miramax, and in New Line's controversial American …     To read the full text of this article and others like it, try us out for 7 days, FREE!
