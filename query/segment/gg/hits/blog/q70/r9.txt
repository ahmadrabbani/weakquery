Other stars like Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth have all been confirmed for the next movie. Norton fell out with Marvel Studios following the release of “The Incredible Hulk”. But in a subsequent interview, the studio managers claimed that Norton would be allowed to feature in the movie’s sequel, if his schedule allows him. Though Norton also said in an interview that he would be glad to feature in “The Avengers”, yet he was dropped. The studio have confirmed that they will cast an unknown actor to play the role played by Norton in the movie. Marvel Studios released a statement, which said that, “We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in the Avengers. Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members.” Norton’s drop from the movie has been speculated for a long time. Several people have speculated that Norton would be dropped but Marvel Studio and Norton both denied that their previous disagreement was enough to warrant his drop.
