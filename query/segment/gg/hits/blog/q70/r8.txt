The actor Edward Norton ( American History X , Fight Club ) plans to run this year's  ING New York City Marathon with a team including three Maasai warriors(!)  to raise money for the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust , an outfit dedicated to protecting the Maasai's tribal homeland in east Africa. ( Photo, from left: Samson Parashina, Edward Norton, Parashi Ntanin, Andrew Wolff, Martin Sunte, Luca Belpietro.  C  ourtesy Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust. ) So how does a celebrity like Edward Norton go from Hollywood to the New York City Marathon… via Africa? And what's it like, training with the Maasai? (Do they do  Yasso 800s ?) We asked him, in an e-mail interview. Runner's World: People run marathons for all sorts of charities, most notably those linked with diseases such as cancer. How did you wind up running to raise funds for the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust?  Edward Norton: I’ve been involved with MWCT for nearly 10 years. I helped start the U.S. nonprofit that supports MWCT’s work and I’m the president of the Board now.  It’s an effort that I’ve been very personally involved with at all levels. We had previously raised money through dinner party events but this year we wanted to step it up a bit, reach a little higher in terms of the level of funding we try to raise and introduce the work to a wider community. And just as important, we wanted to try to do it in a way that could involve our Maasai friends and partners actively in the effort over here.  The marathon seemed like a very organic way to involve them. What sort of threats and challenges are the Maasai up against? How will they use the money you’re raising?  The Maasai community is facing the same basic challenge we all are… 'How do we start living in a way that will sustain the environmental systems that support us?'  Deterioration of the ecosystem that the Maasai rely on is the most serious threat to their way of life.  They are cattle-based agriculturalists who are also increasingly invested in the eco-tourism business.  Both of these economies rely on the health of the legendary grassland ecosystems of East Africa. The money we are raising will fund programs that MWCT runs promoting conservation, education, and health care.  In the coming year our priorities are to professionalize our management staff with more experienced program coordinators and to be able to fund long-term land conservancy zones, which pay the communities yearly revenue for maintaining important wildlife corridors and watersheds. We’ve got sponsors and some individuals making very large donations but we’re really trying hard to build a grassroots network of support, especially among runners.  Our fantasy is that we can get  100,000 people to give $20 .   Three Maasai tribesmen will join you in running the marathon. Will this be their first time in New York City?   One of the guys has been here before,  Samson Parashina . Samson is the President of MWCT.  He is one of the most impressive people I’ve worked with in any field.  Young, brilliant, very sophisticated, and articulate on the subject of conservation and sustainable land use while still very proud of his traditional culture.  He’s the kind of person who is going to lead the next generation to a sustainable kind of prosperity.  He’s also an incredible field naturalist and one of the few people in Kenya with a Silver level Guiding license.  He has been to New York, Seattle, and Santa Barbara to promote the work of MWCT.  He’s stayed with me in New York a number of times.  He likes the good steakhouses and he’s frighteningly good at bowling. Parashi and  Sunte have never traveled outside of Kenya.  I think Sunte has been to Nairobi, but Parahsi has never been to a big city.  They’re both excited and proud to be representing their community but a little nervous, I think.  They are both expert trackers and field guides and work at the community’s safari lodge as guides. What have your Maasai friends taught you about running in general, and marathon training in particular?    Maasai are natural runners. Running long distances is in some ways a part of their culture and tradition. They’re used to heat and hills and to maintaining steady pace over long distance. They’re used to running carrying 25-pound spears and radios and backpacks.  I think this makes them naturally mentally tough; they don’t really seem to have any of the fear of long distance that lots of us do and don’t really consider it very unusual to cover such distances on foot.  They usually run in sandals made out of off-road tires.  They call them “Michelins” or “Thousand Milers.”  The part of the sandal that goes over the top of the foot is the steel belted inner tube.  It’s inconceivable to me that they run in these shoes, but they love them.   I’ve run with all of these guys many times.  They’re very efficient runners, not a lot of arm movement and they seem to me to stay very high on their toes, maybe because the sandals don’t have any heel padding or support.  It makes them look like they’re loping along in a very easygoing way, springing off their toes… even when they’re running fast.  I can hang with Samson and Sunte for a while usually, but Parashi is in a totally elite class.  He was known as a great runner in the region when he was younger.  Going uphill in hot and dusty conditions on very rocky roads, Parashi runs a 7-minute mile without even breathing through his mouth or sweating in the slightest.  I sincerely think he could run a 2:30 marathon, certainly under 3 hours.  We would run 10 miles together and then he’d drop me off and go do his own run so that he could actually get a workout. Parashi is nervous about getting lost in the race through the city and wants to stick with the other guys.  We are trying to convince him to run his best race and we’re discussing with the marathon whether we could find a pace partner for him to be a guide.  I think it would have to be someone who is a 2:30 marathoner.  Maybe Runner’s World can help us find him a running partner so that we can see what he can really do! How much time (if any) have you spent running with the Maasai so far? And based on those experiences, what are your expectations for race day?    I ran all summer in Kenya with these guys and with Luca Belpietro, who founded MWCT out of his safari camp,  Campi ya Kanzi , which is one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been.  It’s a 16-bed safari lodge operated in partnership with the Maasai that employs locally, pays revenues to the community and supports MWCT with conservation surcharges. You run from the camp up into the Chyulu Hills, which are the Green Hills of Africa that Hemingway hunted in and wrote about in “Snows of Kilimanjaro.”  You often run along through herds of wildebeest and zebra and gazelles and giraffe or go around to avoid some buffalo.  There are lion prints on the road every morning.  And the whole time you’re staring right at Kilimanjaro with sunrise on it.  It’s breathtaking. But the hills are pretty steep in places and it’s at about 5,000 feet, so you feel it.  We probably ran about 30 miles a week out there.  It’s tough running.  A lot of lava rock and rutted roads and thorn bushes. And there’s been a bad drought all this year so it’s very dusty right now, where normally it’s high green grass everywhere. I think it will make New York feel easy for these guys, as long as it’s not cold, which they are not used to.  Samson and Sunte want to run in shoes, I think.   Puma is sponsoring us and has been terrific.  They have a real commitment to community programs in Africa and we’ve just started what we hope will be a long-term relationship of support with them.  They sent shoes for the guys to Kenya and will be outfitting our whole team of 30 with race shirts in Maasai patterns, so at least we’ll be able to find each other in the crowd.  But I’m not sure we’re going to talk Parashi out of his Thousand Milers.  He may not win but I think he’ll be among the fastest to ever run in sandals. I’m not worried about any of them.  I’m pretty sure they’ll all be waiting for the rest of us at the end. I think it’s going to be a lot of fun…if I can get my Achilles tendon feeling better!

I want more        Tom  says:  September 25, 2009 at 9:20 am  I'd love the opportunity to run with Parashi in NY! Last fall I ran a 2:34 marathon and I think I'm in better shape this year. Feel free to contact me.        Jack  says:  September 25, 2009 at 9:22 am  oh please don't start that first thing on yet another message board that has been mercifully free from it. Thanks for sharing a wonderful story. Its great to see a celebrity using his celebrity to draw attention to worthy causes instead of, well, unworthy conduct. Happy Friday!        Theresa  says:  September 25, 2009 at 9:26 am  Cool story!        Gogglehead  says:  September 25, 2009 at 9:58 am  Please keep us posted on this story — race results, who will run with Parashi?, will he wear shoes?, their NYC marathon experience.        Gary  says:  September 25, 2009 at 10:03 am  Yes, RW please give us a post race update on their experiene. And if you could interview the Maasai it would be fantatic!        Bethany  says:  September 25, 2009 at 10:08 am  awesome – def pls keep us updated with a post info !!         shaily   says:  September 25, 2009 at 10:38 am  What a great story! I had heard that Ed Norton was going to run with Maasai warriors but I didn't know the story behind it. I wish them all a great race! And their running route(s) sound amazing. I am also willing to trade places with them as a part of the "Runner's Exchange Program"          Chuck77  says:  September 25, 2009 at 11:36 am  Mark, is there any way you could post a photo of the Thousand Milers? Great story.        JCap  says:  September 25, 2009 at 11:52 am  Ed's tweeting about his marathon journey at  https://twitter.com/EdwardNorton -fun to see how he's doing with this awesome endeavor!        ECD  says:  September 25, 2009 at 12:20 pm  Well, my Edward Norton crush just went up a notch! What a great endeavor for a great cause. Looking forward to updates on the team!        StPatJack  says:  September 25, 2009 at 1:43 pm  Here is a link to a pic of the Massai's Thousand Milers: http://www.walkmoreeatless.com/images/321_maasai_warrior_tire_shoes.jpg         Adrienne  says:  September 25, 2009 at 4:26 pm  Tires withstand more weight for more miles than our running shoes; they make sense to run in. To the entire MWCT team: Have fun running the marathon and enjoying the entire marathon weekend experience. I looked at the website for MWCT and did not find contact information for the U.S. non-profit supporting MWCT. If you could provide, or send in an email, this information it would be greatly appreciated. Cheers.        Karen  says:  September 25, 2009 at 5:38 pm  Wow, this is one of the coolest things I have ever heard of. Please be sure to post an update to this after the race. What a great story and cause.        Karen  says:  September 25, 2009 at 5:38 pm  Wow, this is one of the coolest things I have ever heard of. Please be sure to post an update to this after the race. What a great story and cause.        Kristin  says:  September 25, 2009 at 8:47 pm  Interesting story! I will be watching for them while volunteering at the marathon this November!        Alexys  says:  September 25, 2009 at 10:25 pm  Dear Mr. Norton, I loved you before. I love you double now. Good luck to you and your entire team! –Alexys         florit teresa   says:  September 26, 2009 at 4:06 am  This man is just fantastic. I appreciate his lifestyle, his movies, his personality… una "bella persona" indeed! But all the people daily involved in environment and culture defense are jus great and need some help. Masai are amazing, Africa deserves more respect as well as environment and nature ( I have just read about a ritual dolphin massacre in Japan !!!!). Thanks for this article, this link and the information about Masaii marathon. I am working to find some supporters for good contributions… Bye        Morgan  says:  September 26, 2009 at 2:09 pm  What a wonderful cause!!! Though please don't put these guys in shoes… their leg muscles have actually developed the way they were intended to…        KCP  says:  September 26, 2009 at 9:37 pm  Just another reason to love Edward Norton!!!        Silly Lillie  says:  September 26, 2009 at 9:50 pm  This is good news! Thanks for letting us know about this, Mark. I've always been an Edward Norton fan… now I know why! I have a feeling he's faster than he lets on.         Kapande   says:  September 29, 2009 at 1:53 am  I'm very interested with this club and if posible I would like to run with them for the next time. I am a Masai guy from Tanzania Arusha Region Longido District. Give the hai and congratulation        Mario Grillo  says:  October 24, 2009 at 9:39 pm  I work at the American Museum Of Natural History/Hayden Planetarium and was happy to see Edward Norton and his Masai friends take in the Space Show earlier today. I made small talk with them and they all seem awesome. I wish them goo luck! Mario Grillo       Pingback:  Help Us Outrun Cancer (Prizes!
