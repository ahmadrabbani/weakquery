Winter Olympics 2006      The Winter Olympics begin in a week, and with it comes many opportunities for applying the skills in the curriculum in many real world situations. There's measurement in both U.S. and metric standards, elapsed time, the physics of skiing, skating and sledding, political and physical geography, history, civics and politics of the games, economics of the dollar and the Euro, a variety of world languages and cultures��.the list of possibilities goes on and on.  For the most ardent followers of the Olympics, having classroom Olympic games that make use of skills across the curriculum is a great way to motivate students in the gray days of February. You can find units and strategies for setting up such an event, designed to last a day, a week or a month, right online; just Google classroom Olympics.
