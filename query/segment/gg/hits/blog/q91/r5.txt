 The Skidmore College Orchestra 

  The Skidmore College Orchestra Celebrates its 25th Anniversary Season   Now entering it's twenty-fifth concert season, the Skidmore College orchestra is a semi-professional orchestra made up of Skidmore students and top players from several regional professional orchestras, including the Albany Symphony, Berkshire Symphony, Schenectady Symphony and Glens Falls Symphony Orchestra.  Skidmore's unique orchestral program emphasizes  students  in the most important orchestral positions and   features students  in the most important solos. Our professional members create a unique atmosphere where students participate in a  living orchestral lesson each week with the top professional players assisting  our students  in each rehearsal. This combination of professional and student players creates an exciting synergy and an exciting concert atmosphere for players and audience members alike!  Student soloists are also featured each year as winners of the Orchestral Concerto Competition.
