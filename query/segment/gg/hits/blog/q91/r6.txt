Seidl studied at the Leipzig Conservatory from October 1870-1872. Seidl then went to Bayreuth as one of Richard Wagner's copyists, living in Wagner's home. At Bayreuth, Seidl assisted in the creation of the first copy of the score of Das Ring des Nibelungen. As a consequence, Seidl was at the first Bayreuth Festival in the Summer of 1876. An important opportunity for Seidl resulted from Wagner's recommendation of Seidl as conductor of the Leipzig Stadt-Theater.  Seidl conducted in Leipzig from 1878-1882, to be succeeded by his Hungarian contemporary, the young Artur Nikisch (1855-1922).  Then, in 1882, Seidl toured with the Angelo Neumann Nibelungen Ring Company.  The conducting reputation of Seidl was further consolidated during this tour.  In 1885, Seidl was appointed as successor to Leopold Damrosch, who had died (1832-1885) as conductor of the German Repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera. Also, during the Summers, beginning in 1886, Seidl conducted at the Bayreuth Festival.  From 1891-1898, Anton Seidl succeeded Theodore Thomas as Music Director of the New York Philharmonic, where he enjoyed a popularity of something like today's movie celebrities (never experienced by Theodore Thomas).  As a consequence, the Philharmonic Society of New York experienced new financial prosperity.  In 1897, Anton Seidl conducted in London at Covent Garden.  Also in 1897, Anton Seidl organized a symphony orchestra, the Seidl Orchestra so named, that many thought would become a permanent New York feature, given the financial backing of the many Seidl admirers.  However, Anton Seidl died suddenly in New York City on March 28, 1898, not yet age 48, seemingly of food poisoning.  The conducting style of Seidl is said to have been characterized by free tempi and interpretation, even of established classics, such as Beethoven, which divided listeners and critics of the era.         RETURN TO TOP      1884-1902       Walter Damrosch    Walter Damrosch was born in Breslau, Prussia, some 100 km east of Dresden (now Wroclaw, Poland) on January 13, 1862, son of the conductor Leopold Damrosch (1832-1885).  Walter Damrosch, as well as studying under his father, attended the Dresden Conservatory, where he studied with Wilhelm Albert Rischbieter (1834-1910) and Felix Draeseke (1835-1913).  The Damrosch family emigrated to the U.S. in 1871, a year after Leopold Damrosch had visited the U.S. and found it welcoming.  Walter began conducting both oratorio society and concerts under his father, Leopold who became conductor of the German repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in 1884.  At that time, Walter Damrosch was an assistant conductor, and advanced to the German repertoire under Seidl when Leopold Damrosch died in 1885.  At the MET, Walter Damrosch was respected in his conducting of Wagner, although contemporary critics wrote that he did not reach the heights of contemporaries such as Hertz, and well short of the very different approaches of Mahler or Toscanini.  Walter Damrosch was also a successful symphonic conductor.  Leopold Damrosch had founded the New York Symphony Society (in 1903, renamed the New Symphony) in 1878, which Walter Damrosch took over in 1885 upon his father's death.  Walter Damrosch had a successful relationship with Andrew Carnegie which resulted in Carnegie funding of the Symphony Society, and the funding of the construction of Carnegie Hall, opened in 1891.  This was a Damrosch strength of which the New York Times said '...he has the shrewdness in business matters denied most musicians...'  97 .  Andrew Carnegie also supported the 1920 tour of the New York Symphony in Europe, the first U.S. orchestra to make such a tour.  During the 1920s, Damrosch progressively conducted symphony concerts less and less, and beginning 1927, became Music Director for NBC radio.  At NBC, Damrosch lead a successful classical music appreciation program, directed at youths, and which continued until 1942.  Damrosch was also a composer, including of at least four operas, including 'The Scarlet Letter' premiered in 1895  96 .  These works are generally forgotten today.  Walter Damrosch died in New York City December 22, 1950 of a heart attack  95 .        RETURN TO TOP      1901 - 1907       Frank Valentine Van der Stucken        Frank Van der Stucken was born in Fredericksburg, Texas on October 15, 1858.  In 1866, Van de Stucken went to Antwerp with his parents.  Van der Stucken's father, Frank (1830 - circa 1908), was born and raised in Antwerp, and came to Texas.  After serving as a Captain in the Confederate Army, Frank Van der Stucken, Sr. found himself on the wrong side of the after-war society.  He therefore took the family back to Antwerp.  There, Frank Van der Stucken Jr. studied violin with Émile Wambach (1854-1924) from 1866 to 1876 and composition and theory with the Belgian composer Peter Benoit (1834-1901).  Frank Van der Stucken then went to Leipzig where he studied with Carl Reinecke (1824-1910) during 1876 - 1878 as well as with Edvard Grieg (1843-1907) and Hermann Langer (1819–1889) who was then Universitätsmusikdirektor at Leipzig.  Van der Stucken learned conducting by the traditional European method of being a regional kapellmeister, first at the Stadttheater Breslau, Prussia (now Wroclaw, Poland) in 1881-1882.  Van den Stucken was introduced to Franz Liszt at Weimar by his teacher Edvard Grieg in 1883.  From 1879 to 1881 Van der Stucken traveled throughout Europe and met and worked with Giuseppe Verdi, Emmanuel Chabrier, and Jules Massenet.  In about 1883, Frank Van der Stucken moved to New York where he succeeded Leopold Damrosch as conductor of the Arion Society (a choral and orchestral society) from 1884-1895.  According to Hubbard  19 ,     Max Bendix      was the Concertmaster of the Arion Society orchestra (among other orchestral and chamber music jobs) under Van der Stucken in the 1885-1886 season.  Van der Stucken gave concerts with the Arion Society championing music of American composers.   Van der Stucken was appointed the first conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra serving from 1895-1907.  From about 1901 to about 1907, he conducted frequently at the Metropolitan Opera.  Van der Stucken also continued his Cincinnati connection for many years.  He directed the Cincinnati May Festival, from 1906-1912 and 1923-1927 (in earlier years, the Festival was only every second year).  Frank van der Stucken returned for the Cincinnati festivals from Europe.  He had relocated to Germany in 1908.  Van der Stucken again conducted the Cincinnati May Festival in 1923, and was its Music Director in 1925  and 1927.  Van der Stucken's last trip to the United States was in was in October 1928 for celebrations of his 70th birthday with friends and admirers in New York and Cincinnati.  Frank Van der Stucken died in Hamburg, Germany on August 16, 1929.        RETURN TO TOP     1902-1915      Alfred Hertz  - principal conductor of the German repertory   Alfred Hertz was born in Frankfurt, Germany on July 15, 1872.  In the late 1880s, Hertz entered the newly formed Raff Konservatorium in Frankfurt, studying piano and composition under Anton Urspruch (1850-1907).  In 1892, Alfred Hertz began the usual path in Germany for learning conducting, by entering a regional theater, the Hoftheatre of the small town of Altenberg, Germany, 30 km south of Dresden.  Hertz stayed in Altenberg for three seasons, 1892-1895, before going to the Stadttheater of Barmen-Elberfeld (renamed Wuppertal after 1930), near Stuttgart during 1895-1899.  Hertz then went to the much larger city of Breslau, 100 km east of Dresden (Breslau now being in Poland, with the name of Wroclaw).  From 1899-1902, Hertz conducted at the Stadttheater Breslau (where Frank Van der Stucken had also conducted during the 1881-1882 season).  In 1902, Alfred Hertz made the large jump to the Metropolitan Opera, where he became the principal conductor of the Germany repertory, succeeding Walter Damrosch.  Hertz was well received in New York, although some critics thought his orchestra drowned out many of the singers.  On December 24, 1903, Alfred Hertz at the MET was the first to conduct Parsifal outside of Wagner's Bayreuth, causing a controversy.  For a time, all German opera houses would not engage Hertz because of this.  We can still hear Hertz's early interpretation of music from Parsifal in the September, 1913 recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic, beautifully restored by Mark Obert-Thorn on Naxos Historical 8.110049 and 8.110050.  During his tenure at the Metropolitan Opera, Hertz toured the U.S. regularly, including in San Francisco during the great earthquake of 1906.  Hertz left the Metropolitan opera at the end of the 1912-1913 season, and went to Los Angeles that summer of 1913 to conduct at the Panama Exposition.  Hertz then returned to Germany for the 1913-1914 season, where he conducted, among others, the Berlin Philharmonic which also led to the famous Parsifal recording.  In 1915, Hertz came to San Francisco to direct a festival of Beethoven's music, when he was offered direction of the San Francisco Symphony.  So, in the 1915-1916 season, Alfred Hertz became Music Director of the San Francisco Symphony, where he remained for 15 seasons.  In 1917, when the U.S. entered World War 1, Hertz became a U.S. citizen.  When Victor opened its facilities in Oakland, California, across the San Francisco Bay, Hertz led the San Francisco Symphony in a series of recordings 1925-1930.  Many of these recordings in excellent restorations by Mark Obert-Thorn are available from Andrew Rose's superb Pristine Classical (www.pristineclassical.com).  After his farewell San Francisco Symphony concert on April 30, 1930, Hertz remained in California, living in Berkeley, where he endowed Hertz Hall at the University of California, Berkeley.  Hertz also conducted for radio in the 1930s for the Standard Symphony Hour on NBC.  Alfred Hertz died in San Francisco on April 17, 1942.     1908-1910       Gustav Mahler          RETURN TO TOP      1908-1915      Arturo Toscanini      Arturo Toscanini was born on March 25, 1867 in Parma, Italy in the Emilia-Romagna, famous for its musical traditions.  In 1897, Toscanini entered the Parma Conservatory, where he studied cello and solfège  71 .  He graduated in 1885 with distinction.  The next year, in 1886, Toscanini was traveling with a contract orchestra in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  In a famous incident, the local conductor, Leopoldo Miguez (1850-1902) had been rejected by the singers, and after several unsuccessful substitutes, Toscanini, the chorus master took over the performance of Aida on June 30, 1886  71 .  Following his South American successes, Toscanini conducted in Italy, but also continued playing the cello.  Toscanini was in the cello section of the La Scala premiere of Verdi's Otello in 1887.  As Toscanini's conducting reputation grew, he was granted the world premieres of the Leoncavallo - Pagliacci (1892) and Puccini - La Bohème (1896).  In 1898, Toscanini became Director of the Teatro alla Scala, Milan.  Toscanini devoted seven seasons to La Scala, 1898-1903 and 1906-1908.  During Toscanini's tenure at La Scala, he conducted first Italian performances of Wagner - Siegfried, Tchaikovsky - Eugene Onegin, Strauss - Salome and Debussy - Pelléas et Mélisande.  Toscanini then accepted a similar post with the Metropolitan Opera in the 1908-1909 season.  In New York, Toscanini was an instant favorite, and remained until the end of the 1914-1915 season.  During Toscanini's tenure at the Metropolitan Opera, he gave the world premiere of Puccini - La Fanciulla del West, and U.S. premieres of Mussorgsky - Boris Godunov, and revivals of historic works by Weber and Gluck.  In 1915, Toscanini returned to support Italy during World War 1.  Following the war, in 1920-1921, Toscanini toured the U.S. with the La Scala Orchestra, making his first recordings with the Victor Talking Machine Company in December, 1920 and March 1921  69 .  In December 1921, after being closed 1918-1920, Toscanini reopened La Scala with a famous performance of 'Falstaff'.  After leaving La Scala, Toscanini accepted to become co-conductor (with Willem Mengelberg) of the of New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra, 1926-1930.  Then, in 1930, following the merger of the Philharmonic Society of New York with the New York Symphony Society Toscanini became its sole conductor.  Political developments also had an important effect on Toscanini's career.  In the early 1920s, Toscanini became disillusioned with Mussolini and with fascism and repeatedly refused to conduct the Fascist anthem  Giovinezza .  At a memorial concert for Giuseppe Martucci in May, 1931 Toscanini was attacked by fascist blackshirts when he again refused to conduct  Giovinezza .  Toscanini then abandoned Italy.  Toscanini was the first non-German conductor at Bayreuth at the 1930 and 1931 festivals.  He also took the New York Philharmonic on a European tour in 1930, including at Bayreuth.  1934-1937, Toscanini conducted at the Salzburg Festival, but withdrew in 1938 after the German anschluss of Austria.  In 1936, Toscanini accepted the Bronislaw Huberman (1882-1947) invitation to conduct the inaugural concert of the Palestine Symphony  72 .  In 1937, on David Sarnoff's initiative the new NBC Symphony Orchestra was formed for Toscanini who conducted the first broadcast concert on December 25, 1937.  Toscanini continued to conduct the NBC Symphony until his famous last concert on April 4, 1954.  What more can be said or written about Toscanini, certainly the most famous conductor of the Twentieth Century ?  His precision, dedication to perfection, his tantrums (another aspect of perfection), his dedication to the score (although he, too, made changes), his memory and above all, his genius.  The reputation that his later performances, rather than slowing, as did other conductors late in their careers, such as Klemperer, Walter, Weingartner, instead sped up.  Some claimed they became too hard-driven.  Although not always true, there is in my view some truth in this opinion.  Mortimer H. Frank in his fascinating book   Arturo Toscanini - The NBC Years  writes that this speeding up was '...the product of his rethinking of interpretive problems...'  73 .  Toscanini's later Wagner did not speed up, and there was always a pulse in the music appropriate to the score.  However, Toscanini's earlier BBC recordings, and particularly his New York Philharmonic recordings, which are few, also contain some of his best work.  His 1936 Philharmonic recording of the Beethoven Symphony no 7 remains, for me, unsurpassed.  I recommend you download this legendary performance in Andrew Rose's    superb restoration at www.pristineclassical.com    (http://www.pristineclassical.com/LargeWorks/Orchestral/PASC068.php)        RETURN TO TOP     1915-1939       Artur Bodanzky  - principal conductor of the German repertory   Artur Bodanzky was born in Vienna, Austria on December 16, 1877 of Hungarian parents Carl Bodanzky and Hanna Feuchtwang, neither of whom were particularly musical.  In the 1890s in Vienna, Bodanzky studied violin and composition with the young Alexander Zemlinsky (1871-1942, later known for his conducting and compositions).  Bodanzky graduated from the Vienna Conservatory in 1896  36 .  Beginning in the 1896-1897 season, Bodanzky played in the first violin section of the Vienna Opera  36 .  In about 1901, Bodanzky then became a conducting assistant to Gustav Mahler at the Vienna Opera.  Bodanzky then went to the Komische Oper of Budweis in what was then referred to as Bohemia (now Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic) in about 1904.  Bodanzky conducted opera and light opera in Paris, Russia, and Germany.  In the 1906-1909 seasons, Artur Bodanzky was conductor at the Neues Deutsches Landestheater in Prague, where Otto Klemperer also conducted from 1907-1910.  After Prague, Bodanzky went to the Mannheim Stadttheater as principal conductor and later Music Director 1909-1913.  Bodanzky came to the U.S. in October, 1915 to assume his duties as principal conductor of the German repertory at the MET.  Bodanzky had been accepted by Toscanini, still then at the MET, with whom Bodanzky shared the conducting of the German repertoire until Toscanini's departure one year later.  New York critics in 1916 favorably compared Bodanzky's performances of Wagner with those of Toscanini.  Bodanzky also became conductor of the Society of Friends of Music which post he held 1916-1931.  Bodanzky became a U.S. citizen in 1921.  At the end of the 1927-1928 season, Bodanzky resigned from the Metropolitan Opera, and in the next season, Joseph Rosenstock was appointed as principal conductor of the German repertoire.  This selection of Rosenstock, who had been conductor at the Stadtsoper, Wiesbaden  35 proved unsuccessful, and Bodanzky was retained again in the 1929-1930 season, where he remained until his death in 1939.  Bodanzky was noted for the rapid tempi of his conducting, including of the music of Wagner.  He was also criticized for the number of cuts he made to scores, even in an era that extensive cuts to operas was the norm.  Arthur Bodanzky suffered a heart attack on October 28, 1939, and died one month later on November 23, 1939 at the beginning of his twenty-fourth season at the Metropolitan Opera.        RETURN TO TOP     1924-1934       Tullio Serafin     Tullio Serafin was born in Rottanova di Cavarzere, Italy, near Venice on September 1, 1878.  Serafin was a child prodigy on the violin, and is said to have played for Verdi.  Serafin studied violin at the Milan Conservatory.  He played in the La Scala orchestra under Toscanini, beginning in about 1898.  Serafin made his conducting debut at Ferrara, Italy in 1898.  In the early 1900s, Serafin also began conducting at La Scala.  His abilities were such that when Toscanini departed for the Metropolitan Opera in 1908, Serafin increased his conducting, and was named Music Director, beginning in the 1909-1910 season.  Serafin introduced new works, such as conducting the Italian premiere of Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier  41 .  Serafin continued in this position until 1918 except when La Scala was closed 1914-1917 because of World War 1.  La Scala was then again closed 1918-1920.  In 1924, Serafin joined the conducting staff at the MET in the Italian repertoire for ten seasons until the end of 1933-1934.  In 1926, Serafin went to Rome to take over the Teatro Reale dell'Opera, which he resuscitated during the next decade, 1934-1943.  Serafin is said to be one of the first who realized the great talent of Maria Callas, and cultivated it.  Callas said that it was Serafin, who conducted her Italian debut, who guided her to become a prima donna  41 .  With Maria Callas, Serafin did much to create interest in the 'bel canto', repertoire, substantially forgotten in opera houses by the mid-Twentieth century.  Most singers were happy under Serafin's direction, since he was typically positive, supportive, and attentive to their musical styles.  Tullio Serafin died in Rome in February 2, 1968, just short of his ninetieth birthday.        RETURN TO TOP      1934-1943      Ettore Panizza    Ettore Panizza was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina on August 2, 1875, of parents of Italian heritage.  Panizza's father, and first teacher was a cellist at the Teatro Colón, in Buenos Aires.  Panizza studied at the Milan Conservatory.  Panizza's conducting debut was at the Rome Opera, in 1897, where he held the position of assistant.  Panizza conducted at La Scala, Milan from about 1908-1919, and then following the reopening 1921-193.  Panizza shared the conducting duties with Toscanini following the 1921 reopening until Toscanini left for the New York Philharmonic in 1929.  Panizza, continued at La Scala until the end of the 1931-1932 season.  Joseph Horowitz wrote that Panizza at La Scala was regarded highly by Toscanini and also by Richard Strauss, who arranged that Panizza would conduct Electra in Vienna  33 .  Panizza also conducted at Covent Garden, London in the early 1930s.  Beginning in the 1934-1935 season, he took over responsibilities as principal conductor of the Italian repertoire from Tullio Serafin.  Panizza remained at the MET until the end of the 1943-1943 season, when he returned to Italy following the fall of Mussolini.  Also, all during his time at La Scala and the MET, Panizza continued to conduct at the Teatro Colón during the 'off' season, which was the prime opera season for the Teatro Colón.  Panizza's conducting style was vigorous and propulsive.  Panizza died in Milan, Italy November 27, 1967.        RETURN TO TOP     1939-1942,  1957-1962     Erich Leinsdorf    - principal conductor of the German repertory   Erich Leinsdorf was born Erich J. Landauer in Vienna, Austria on February 4, 1912. Leinsdorf studied piano, cello and conducting at the Universität Mozarteum Salzburg, followed by the University of Vienna and the Vienna Conservatory. At the Salzburg Festival, 1934-1938, Leinsdorf was conducting assistant first to Bruno Walter and then Arturo Toscanini. Leinsdorf's ability to sight read scores at the piano, his memory, and his Italian language skills were advantages at Salzburg, and Toscanini became something of a mentor to Leinsdorf.  During these years, Leinsdorf also conducted opera Italy, in Bologna, Trieste, Florence, and San Remo.  In 1938, Leinsdorf left Vienna and Europe because of the rise of the Nazi influence and went to New York.  At the recommendation of Lotte Lehmann to Artur Bodanzky  55 , Leinsdorf joined the Metropolitan Opera in the 1938-1939 season. Beginning in the 1939-1940 season, following the death or Artur Bodanzky, Erich Leinsdorf was named principal MET conductor of the German repertory, which gave Leinsdorf's career an immediate boost during 1939-1942.  Leinsdorf found the Metropolitan Opera progressively more frustrating, with the few rehearsals and the negative atmosphere of opera house politics.  In 1942 in a controversial selection process in which candidates George Szell and Vladimir Golschmann were turned down  54 , Erich Leinsdorf was named Music Director of the Cleveland Orchestra. Leinsdorf happily departed from the MET, but he was unlucky at Cleveland.   First, in the 1942-1943 season, with the US entering World War 2, Cleveland lost 22 musicians, whom Leinsdorf needed to replace.  One of Leinsdorf's hires was George Goslee, Principal bassoon, who remained with the orchestra for 44 seasons.  Then, Leinsdorf himself was drafted into the U.S. Army 1943-1945, and so was not able to make his mark in Cleveland.  Leinsdorf received his Army discharge in September, 1944.  Meanwhile, the 1944-1945 Cleveland Orchestra season had already been programmed with guest conductors including George Szell who had very successful series of November 1944 concerts.  The 1945-1946 Cleveland season became a horserace between Leinsdorf, Szell, and Vladimir Golschmann as to who would become permanent Music Director.  Szell made a strong impression on Cleveland that season, and Erich Leinsdorf gradually lost our to Szell.  This may have seemed the destiny of George Szell, who continued with 24 seasons of greatness with the Cleveland Orchestra.  Leinsdorf then went on to the Rochester Philharmonic, where he was Music Director for eight seasons, 1947-1955.  Then, after a brief period at the New York City Opera, Leinsdorf returned as a leading conductor of the Metropolitan Opera during 1957-1962.     Erich Leinsdorf was appointed Music Director of the Boston Symphony in the 1962-1963 season.  During his seven seasons with the BSO until 1969, Leinsdorf and the Boston Symphony made many recordings for RCA Victor, including an excellent series of Prokofiev symphonies and concerti.  1978-1980, Erich Leinsdorf was conductor of the Berlin Radio Orchestra.   After the departure of Lorin Maazel from his stormy Cleveland tenure in 1982, Erich Leinsdorf returned to Cleveland frequently to provide continuity prior to the arrival of Christoph von Dohnányi in the 1984-1985 season.  Erich Leinsdorf in his last years divided his residence among Sarasota, Florida, Zurich, Switzerland, and New York.  Erich Leinsdorf died in a Zurich hospital, suffering from cancer on September 11, 1993.  His musical erudition and generous personality gained respect, and during his most inspired performances, particularly in the opera house, he was often the equal of any of his contemporaries.        RETURN TO TOP      1942-1946    George Szell    George Szell rehearsing in his first season with the Cleveland Orchestra 1947   George Szell was born in Budapest, Hungary on June 7, 1897.  Before he was six, his family had moved to Vienna, and George Szell considered himself Viennese in origin.  He showed early musical talent and was taken as a piano student by Richard Robert (1861-1924), who also taught Rudolf Serkin and Clara Haskill, and who had been a friend of Brahms.  Georg Szell (as he was then) toured a number of European cities in 1909 as a piano prodigy.  By his mid-teens, Szell said later that he had determined to become a conductor.  His first conducting opportunity came, it seems in a Bavarian spa, Bad Kissingen in either 1913 or 1914 according to different sources.  He had been vacationing there, where members of the Vienna Symphony were also performing.  The Vienna Symphony conductor was injured, and Szell substituted, with success.  In 1915, he conducted the Blüthner Orchestra, sponsored by the piano company, in Berlin.  Also in 1915, at age 18, Szell gained appointment as one of the conductors at the Berlin Royal Opera or "Königliche Kapelle", after 1919 named "Staatsoper Berlin".  There, Richard Strauss became something of a mentor to Szell, whom he saw had great talents, including in the performance of Strauss's own compositions.  A famous story, often retold, from about this time was of the 1917 acoustic recording of Strauss's  Don Juan , opus 20.  The recording with the Königliche Kapelle orchestra was to be rehearsed by Szell, so that Strauss could sleep later.  After the rehearsal, with Strauss still not arriving, the Gramophon engineers instructed Szell to continue to conduct the recording.  After Szell had recorded two of the four 78 RPM sides of about 4 minutes each, Strauss who had arrived conducted the other two sides.  This recording, issued on Gramophon disks 69525, 69526, 65856, and 65857  74 shows Szell more fiery and rapid, and Strauss more lyrical.  In later years, Szell said that he learned much about music and conducting from Strauss, although he also told amusing stories about Strauss's occasional lack of involvement with his conducting if other things were on Strauss's mind.     After the Berlin Royal Opera, in 1917, Szell had the opportunity to become conductor of the Municipal Theatre, Strasbourg on the recommendation of Otto Klemperer, whom he succeeded.  In 1918, Szell went to the German Opera (Neues deutsches Theater) in Prague.  This experience was followed in about 1921-1924 by conducting appointments of the Darmstadt Theater and of the Deutsche Oper - Düsseldorf.  In 1924, Georg Szell returned to the renamed Berlin State Opera - Staatsoper Berlin as a conductor under Erich Kleiber.  In 1929, Georg Szell returned to Prague now as Music Director of the German Opera and of the Philharmonic.  The next season 1930-1931 saw his US premier as a guest conductor of the St. Louis Symphony in 1930, where he returned in 1931.  Szell was considered a candidate for the St. Louis Symphony music directorship, vacant since the 1927 departure of Rudolph Ganz to the Chicago Musical College.  Meanwhile, Szell continued his posts in Prague until 1937, when he accepted two concurrent orchestra responsibilities: the Residente Orchestra in the Hague - Netherlands and the Scottish Orchestra (later the Scottish National Orchestra) in Glasgow.  In 1938 and 1939, George Szell performed extensively in Australia with the Australian Broadcasting Company.  Returning from Australia in 1939, with war beginning in Europe, George Szell stayed in New York City, where he initially taught at the Mannes School of Music.  In the summers of 1939 and 1940, Szell was a conductor at the Hollywood Bowl.  An important break for Szell was Toscanini's invitation conduct the NBC Symphony in 1941.  Toscanini is said to have been impressed previously when he guest-conducted Szell's Residente Orchestra and found it much improved.  Szell was hired for the German repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in the 1942-1943 season, succeeding Erich Leinsdorf.  George Szell continued at the Metropolitan Opera for four seasons 1942-1946.   After Arthur Rodzinski accepted the Music Director position of the New York Philharmonic in December, 1942, George Szell was a candidate, along with Erich Leinsdorf and Vladimir Golschmann to become Music Director of the Cleveland Orchestra.      As described above     , Erich Leinsdorf was selected for Cleveland, but within a year, Leinsdorf entered the US Army, so making little impression in Cleveland.  In the 1944-1945 season, when Leinsdorf was available to conduct, the Cleveland Orchestra season had already been programmed with guest conductors including George Szell.  The 1945-1946 Cleveland season became a horserace between Leinsdorf, Szell, and Vladimir Golschmann as to who would become permanent conductor.  George Szell gradually emerged during that season as the favorite, and was appointed Music Director beginning with the 1946-1947 season.  This began one of the legendary Conductor - Orchestra partnerships of the twentieth century.         RETURN TO TOP     1945-1949       Fritz Busch       Fritz Busch was born in Siegen, Westphalia, Germany on March 13, 1890.  Fritz's father had wanted to be a musician, and starting as a carpenter, he later became a violin maker  86 .  He brought up a family that was musical; Fritz's younger brother Adolf Busch (1891-1952) was a violinist, and Hermann Busch (1898-1975) was a well-known cellist.          Rudolf Serkin with father-in-law Adolf Busch and Hermann Busch Fritz Busch began piano study at age five, and also began studying the instruments of the orchestra early as part of his free tuition  86 .  At Cologne, he studied piano under Karl Boettcher and conducting under Fritz Steinbach (1855-1916).  In 1909, still only 19, he had his first conducting experience at the Deutsches Theater in Riga, Latvia (Bruno Walter also had early conducting experience there).  This was followed by two small regional orchestras in central Germany: Bad Pyrmont and Gotha.  In 1912, he moved to the larger city of Aachen in the extreme west of Germany.  Following his service in World War 1 (he was wounded), an opportunity in 1918 for Busch to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic in music of Reger led Fritz Busch to be appointed conductor in Stuttgart 1918-1922.  In 1922, Busch moved to the post he was early associated with, as Music Director of the Semper Opera in Dresden, Germany.  Fritz Busch developed the Semper Opera into one of the leading opera houses of Europe.  He led the premieres of several Richard Strauss operas: Intermezzo (1924) and Die Ägyptische Helena - The Egyptian Helen (1928).  Busch prepared the premiere of Strauss' Arabella in 1933.  However, with the accession of the Nazi government, Busch, although not Jewish, was an early target because of his expressed political disagreement with 'National Socialism'.  Fritz Busch was expelled from the Semper Opera, and Clemens Krauss conducted the premiere  85 .  At this time, Busch was invited to conduct at the Colon Theater in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he went in 1933, leaving Germany.  Fritz Busch was Music Director of the Glyndebourne Music Festival 1934-1951.  During this same period, Fritz Busch was principal guest conductor of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra in Copenhagen 1934-1951.  He also guest conducted many leading orchestras in the 1930s and 1940s, including the NBC Symphony, the Chicago Symphony, the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and.  Fritz Busch made his Metropolitan Opera debut November 26, 1945 with Wagner's Lohengrin  89 .  1945-1949, Busch was one of the principal conductors of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, not only in German, but in the Italian repertoire.  In early 1951, Fritz Busch accepted the direction of the Vienna Staatsoper.  In the Summer of 1951, Fritz Busch conducted at the Glyndebourne, and took Glyndebourne to the Edinburgh Festival.  Busch had progressive heart disease during the previous five years, and on July 20, 1951 he collapsed during a performance of Don Giovanni  88 .  Although ill, was able to complete the season with at Glyndebourne and Edinburgh.  He was to have taken the Glyndebourne company on a U.S. tour in 1952.  However, Fritz Busch died of a heart attack in a London hotel on September 14, 1951  87 .  So, Fritz Busch's death at age only 61 prevented him from taking up either the Vienna Staatsoper position or the Glyndebourne U.S. tour.  Fritz Busch certainly had a successful career in North and South America, and in England and Denmark.  However, after Dresden, Busch never benefited from the public acclaim given to the very most popular conductors of his generation.  Yet, his surviving recordings demonstrate he was of that level.        RETURN TO TOP     1949-1953       Fritz Reiner    (Frederick Martin Reiner)   Fritz Reiner was born in Budapest, Hungary on December 19, 1888.  Reiner in Budapest intended to study law, at the urging of his father, but in 1899, he entered the Franz Liszt Academy, where he studied piano (including with Bela Bartok) and composition (Leo Weiner).  Reiner had his initial experiences as a répétiteur at the German Comic Opera at Budapest in 1908.  In 1910-1911, Reiner was conductor at the German Opera House in Ljubljana (now in Slovenia) under Vaclav Talich (1883-1961).  In 1914, Reiner moved to Dresden, conducting at the Saxon Court Oper, where he came into extended contact with Richard Strauss.  In Dresden, Reiner conducted the first performance of Strauss's 'Die Frau ohne Schatten', immediately following its Vienna premieres in 1919.  Reiner left Dresden in 1921 and then emigrated to the U.S. in 1922 to become conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony, following his predecessors Frank Van der Stucken (1895-1907), Leopold Stokowski (1909-1912), and Eugène Ysaÿe (1918-1922).  Fritz Reiner stayed in Cincinnati for eleven seasons, from 1922-1933.  By the 1925-1926 season, only 25 of the original 92 musicians of the orchestra when Reiner arrived in 1922 were still with the Cincinnati Symphony.  Reiner became a U.S. citizen in 1928.  Beginning in 1931, Reiner was in charge of the conducting program at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, where he continued until 1938.  In the 1938-1939 season, Reiner became Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony, which he reorganized and improved, while firing dozens of musicians each season.  Reiner remained at Pittsburgh until the end of the 1947-1948 season, where he made a number of famous recordings for Columbia records.  During this period, he also made stylish recordings of baroque music including the Bach Brandenburg Concerti with New York session musicians which demonstrated his mastery, uncommon for the period, of baroque playing.  In both Pittsburgh and Chicago, Reiner also recorded a number of works of Bela Bartok, and he was instrumental in convincing Serge Koussevitzky to commission in 1943 Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra.  1949-1953 and as guest conductor later, Fritz Reiner was the principal among a number of staff conductors at the MET, during the early regime of Rudolf Bing, who became General Manager in 1950.  While at the MET, Reiner conducted a number of famous productions, including in 1949, the Strauss Salome with soprano Ljuba Welitsch as Salome, and the U.S. premiere of Stravinsky's 'The Rake's Progress' in 1951.  In 1953, Reiner was named Music Director of the Chicago Symphony, a post he maintained for nine seasons until the end of the 1961-1962 season.  Reiner then became Musical Advisor in Chicago for the 1962-1963 season.  Even though Georg Solti famously claimed that prior to his arrival in Chicago in 1969, the Chicago Symphony was a 'provincial orchestra', in fact, through good selection of musicians, demanding standards and in part through his ruthless elimination of any musician who displeased him, Reiner build one of the great orchestras of the world in Chicago.  Although many conductors have had the reputation of being a martinet, Fritz Reiner does seem to have had a sadistic streak in his conduct, and was famous for his hounding of the the musicians of weakest character in his orchestras, and playing 'mind games' to manipulate his players.  However, strong characters, such as Ray Still (oboe) or Donald Peck (flute) generally did not have problems with Reiner.  In Chicago, Reiner also produced many great recordings, too numerous to mention individually.  These recordings for Victor were also sonically at the leading edge of their time, and are still highly regarded both for inspired performances, and rich, transparent sound.  In spite of being, perhaps a mean and unlovable as a person, Fritz Reiner as a conductor was one of the greats of the Twentieth Century, with a command of musical idioms from Bach, through Mozart, to the Romantics and Strauss, up to the music by his teacher, Bartok.  Perhaps the only surprising gap is that he seems not to have been one of the great interpreters of Beethoven.  Following a major heart attack in October 7, 1960, Reiner did not conduct the Chicago Symphony until late March, 1961  31 .  After the heart attack, Reiner continued to conduct, although more cautiously, in Chicago, and preparing a new MET production of Die Götterdämmerung.  Finally, after April, 1963, Reiner withdrew to his long-time home, Rambleside in Connecticut.  Fritz Reiner died in New York City November 15, 1963.        RETURN TO TOP     1954-1960       Dimitri Mitropoulos       1973-1974      Rafael Jeroným Kubelík  - Music Director     Rafael Kubelik was born June 29, 1914 in Bychory, a Czech village about 50 km east of Prague.  Rafael was the sixth of 8 musical children of the famous Bohemian violinist Jan Kubelik (1880-1940) and his wife Countess Marianne Czáky-Szell.  Rafael initially studied violin with his father, and also piano with his uncle Frantisek Kubelik, with whom Rafael played the symphonic classics four hands.  Rafael Kubelik entered the Prague Conservatory in 1928, where he studied violin, piano, composition, and conducting, where he graduated with his diploma in 1933.  In 1935 and 1936, Rafael Kubelik toured with his father, first in Europe and in 1936 in the US and Canada, Jan playing the violin, and Rafael accompanying on piano, or conducting  113 .    Publicity for Jan and Rafael Kubelik touring the US in 1936   In 1936, Kubelik was appointed by Vaclav Talich to Assistant Conductor of the Czech Philharmonic.  In 1937, when Talich was unable to take the Czech Philharmonic on a UK tour, Kubelik substituted for him 112 .  Kubelik was Director of the Brno Opera House from 1939-1941, and was chief conductor of the Czech Philharmonic 1942-1948.  In 1948, with the rise of a Communist authoritarian regime, Kubelik left Czechoslovakia, vowing not to return until the end of authoritarian rule.  Kubelik settled first in England, where he conducted, including at Glyndebourne.  Rafael Kubelik was offered conducting positions in the UK, including as a successor to Sir Adrian Boult at the BBC Orchestra, but opted instead for the Chicago Symphony.  Kubelik was Music Director of the Chicago Symphony for three seasons 1950-1953.  His Music Directorship in Chicago started badly when he attempted to replace replacing 22 of musicians during the first season, which met vigorous opposition.  Also, during his Chicago term, Chicago Tribune music critic Claudia Cassidy who was an unrelenting critic of Kubelik  109 , among other reasons it is said because of too heavy a diet of contemporary music.  Kubelik then returned to the UK, where he conducted both symphony and opera.  On October 6, 1954, Kubelik was named Music Director of Covent Garden Opera, serving 1955-1958.  108 . However, Kubelik's time at the Covent Garden Opera was also stormy, with Sir Thomas Beecham, among others, criticizing having a foreign Music Director of Covent Garden.  Although Kubelik remained, he did not renew his contract in 1958.  Although Kubelik had refused to conduct in Germany following World War 2, he accepted to become Music Director of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1961.  Kubelik remained in Munich 1961-1980 producing also numerous recordings.  Kubelik took Swiss citizenship in 1967  110 In late 1971, Goran Gentele, the new General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera asked Kubelík to become Music Director, a newly created position, which even Arturo Toscanini did not hold.  Kubelik and Gentele had a good working relationship, and Kubelík accepted, being named Music Director of the Metropolitan Opera in 1972  111 . However, Gentele died in an automobile accident in Italy on July 18, 1972, which undermined Kubelík's working conditions at the MET.  Kubelik made his Metropolitan Opera debut in October, 1973 with  Les Troyens .  However, he suffered regular criticism as spenting too much time in Europe, and of being a weak administrator.  Tensions at the MET continued, and in February 1974, five months after his debut, he resigned.  James Levine subsequently succeeded Kubelik  110 .  In later years, Kubelik's health deteriorated, due to heart disease and arthritis, which forced his retirement in 1985  112 .  However, Rafael Kubelik did conduct on further occassions: he returned to Czechoslovakia in 1990 to conduct "Ma Vlast" at the opening of the first Prague Spring Festival after the Vaclav Havel "Velvet Revolution". He also returned to Chicago on several occasions, the last being on October 18, 1991, the commemorative Centennial concert of the CSO, recreating the first Theodore Thomas concert of October 16, 1891.  Kubelik conducted the Dvorak  Hussika Overture at that Centennial celebration.  Rafael Kubelik died near Lucerne, Switzerland on August 11, 1996.        RETURN TO TOP      1997-2008       Valery Gergiev  - Principal Guest Conductor    Valery Abisalovich Gergiev was born May 2, 1953 in Moscow, USSR.  Gergiev was raised in North Ossetia in the Caucasus region.  After study of piano as a youth, he entered the Rimsky-Korsakov Conservatory in Leningrad 1972-1977.  At the Conservatory, he studied with Professor Ilya Aleksandrovich Musin (1903-1999), whose many students included Semyon Bychkov, Oleg Caetani, Konstantin Simeonov, and Yuri Temirkanov, and as well as Valery Gergiev.  After graduation from the Conservatory, Gergiev was appointed in 1978 assistant conductor to Yuri Temirkanov at the the Kirov Opera  91 (which reverted to its historic name of the Mariinsky Theater in 1992).  Gergiev became the Director of the Kirov Opera in 1988, and guided it through its transition 1992-1993 back to its roots as the Mariinsky Theater  92 .  In 1991, Valery Gergiev conducted acclaimed productions at the Bavarian State Opera ( Boris Godunov ), and the San Francisco Opera ( War and Peace ).  In 1992, the Kirov - Mariinsky Opera also performed under Gergiev in New York City  90 .  In 1993, Gergiev made his debut at Covent Garden, London ( Eugene Onegin )  91 .  Beginning in 1988, Gergiev was a regular guest conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, and then during 1995-2008, Gergiev became Chief (or Principal) Conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic  93 .  Since about 1991, Gergiev has guest-conducted most of the leading orchestras of the world.  Valery Gergiev made his Metropolitan Opera debut on April 2, 1993 with  Otello .  Gergiev was named Principal Guest Conductor of the Metropolitan Opera for the 1997-1998 season, and remained for 11 seasons until the end of 2007-2008.        RETURN TO TOP      1973-present       James Levine  - 1973-1975 - Principal Conductor,  1975-present - Music Director    James Levine was born June 23, 1943 in that musical city of Cincinnati, Ohio.  His father was a violinist who lead a dance band, and his mother had studied with Martha Graham.  Levine began piano study at age 4  51 , and was something of a prodigy.  At age 10, he played the Mendelssohn Second Piano Concerto at a Cincinnati Symphony youth concert.  Also at age 10, Levine began study with Walter Levin, first violin of the LaSalle Quartet, then quartet-in-residence in Cincinnati. (Levin apparently initially said 'the ten-year-old has not been born that I would teach'.)  In the summer of 1956, at age 13, Levine studied at Rudolf Serkin's Marlboro Music School in Vermont.  The next summer, in 1957, Levine attended the Aspen Music School in Colorado, where he studied with with pianist Rosina Lhévinne (1880-1976), even though Levine had already settled on conducting as a career.  His relationship with Rosina Lhévinne continued over the next decades.  In 1961, Levine entered the Juilliard School, where he studied conducting with Jean Morel (1903-1975).  James Levine graduated from Juilliard in 1964, just before his twenty-first birthday.  In later years, James Levine said that the three most influential persons on his musical development were Walter Levin, Rosina Lhévinne, and Jean Morel.  Levine thought that Jean Morel was perhaps not one of the great conductors, but a very good teacher of preparation and conducting technique  51 .  In 1964-1965 season, Levine studied with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra, where he became assistant conductor to Szell 1965-1970.  In 1971, Levine succeeded Seiji Ozawa as Music Director of Chicago's Ravinia Festival.  From 1971-1994, for twenty-three seasons, James Levine was Music Director of the Ravinia Festival each summer, being succeeded in turn by Christoph Eschenbach.  During this period, 1974-1978, Levine was also Music Director of the Cincinnati May Festival in his home town.  Levine made his Metropolitan Opera debut in the summer of 1971, with an acclaimed performance of Tosca, followed by return engagements.  Then, in the 1973-1974 season, Levine was appointed Principal Conductor of the Metropolitan Opera.  Levine was further offered the Music Director position of the Metropolitan Opera by Schuyler Chapin, then General Manager, but with the stipulation that Chapin would reserve artistic decisions, as Sir Rudolf Bing had done  51 .  James Levine is said to have considered such an arrangement unworkable.  The situation evolved, including the departure of Chapin.  Then, for the 1976-1977 season, James Levine was appointed Music Director of the Metropolitan Opera, a position Levine still holds.  In this position, it can be said that Levine has more total authority at the Metropolitan Opera than even Arturo Toscanini did with Gatti-Casazza from 1908-1915.     At the MET, Levine has every year improved the working conditions and the quality of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.  Levine gradually added co-Principals in each of the orchestra sections, so as to reduce the heavy weekly work load of the Principal musicians.  This, and the improvement of salaries and conditions allowed the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra to hire the best musicians, and to improve overall performance quality.  With the virtuoso level of his orchestra, Levine also began a regular series of successful concert programs by the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra at Carnegie Hall.  This was not the first time the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra had given purely orchestral concerts, but it was judged by critics to have achieved a new level of organization and quality in this orchestral series.  James Levine first conducted the Boston Symphony in 1972.  James Levine became the fourteenth Music Director of the Boston Symphony in the 2004-2005 season.  Since his appointment in Boston, Levine has suffer health problems, including surgery in 2008 and 2009.  Most serious was lengthy spinal surgery in April, 2010.  However, James Levine made a triumphant return to open the 2010-2011 Boston Symphony season on October 2, 2010  101 .  Unfortunately, it was not to last, and the spinal problems continued, forcing James Levine to resign as Music Director of the Boston Symphony in March, 2011.        RETURN TO TOP         Life of the Musician of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra      The prestige and caliber of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra has always been high, yet has increased further since about 1980, when James Levine began to progressively reduce individual musician workload and adding second or alternate musicians for the key orchestral chairs.      David Berkowitz in his enjoyable memoire   Behind the Gold Curtain   2 give in intimate look at the life of the Metropolitan Orchestra musician when he began as a viola player in 1936, until his retirement fifty years later.  In 1936, he states, the orchestra musicians were contracted for 8 performances per week, 7 evening operas and one Saturday matinee  3 .  By 1961, the musicians played 7 performances per week  11 , compared with the typical American orchestra schedule of 3 performances per week, and of concerts typically shorter than the length of most operas.    In 1961, the musicians of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra sought to negotiate a new contract providing them with less performances, and procedures to reduce the ability of the Metropolitan Opera management (Rudolf Bing and the conductors) to fire or demote orchestra musicians.  The orchestra failed to achieve its objectives, which set up the confrontation in 1966 prior to the opening of the new Metropolitan Opera house in Lincoln Center.     in 1964, the musicians allowed their contract to be extended, and worked for a year without a contract leading up to the opening of the new opera house in the Autumn of 1966.  They believed, correctly, that this lack of a contract would allow the musicians to bargain powerfully for the concessions they sought, but had failed to win in 1961.  The Orchestra prevailed on Sir Rudolf Bing, General Manager from 1950 to 1972 by threatening to delay the opening of the new Opera House at Lincoln Center.  The principal issue was that of reducing the weekly performance load.  They gained a reduction to 6.5 performance per week (a night off every second week), and further progressive reductions to 5 performances a week by 1970  4 .  Also, they gained, for the first time, group medical insurance.      As he gained administrative authority, James Levine, starting in 1980 progressively reduced the workload and consequently was able to attract the number of quality of musicians necessary to add 'second' or 'alternate' musicians for the first chairs of each of the instrumental sections, including the strings.  For many years, and at least since World War 1, the woodwinds and brass had employed alternates, since the demands of these instruments would not permit them to play night after night without respite, without the risk of a breakdown.     As the number of performances per week decreased, the season however, gradually increased from 12 weeks in the 1930s 16 weeks 1937-1945  13 and to 26 weeks by 1952.  This would also increase in those years with extended national tours, such as 1948 and 1949, when ten addition weeks of touring was added  5 .   By the 1980s, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra's season was for the full year.  For the first time, the MET Orchestra musicians had year-around employment with a workload similar to their Symphony Orchestra colleagues, and with medical insurance.  The improvements in playing standards became gradually apparent under Levine.        RETURN TO TOP      Composition of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra     From its inception until the end of World War 1, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra was predominantly composed of German trained musicians.  This was also the case in many of the U.S. symphony orchestras, including New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.  Anne Mischakoff Heiles in her excellent book   America's Concertmasters  writes, quoting also from David Mann: '...Soon he [Mann] was asked to substitute at the Metropolitan Opera and at two Philharmonic concerts led by Anton Seidl. Rehearsals were conducted in German, and American musicians were a rarity - only three of the Philharmonic's hundred players!...'  34 .     Joseph Horowitz in his book Classical music in America writes: '...A comparison of MET rosters for 1914-1915 and 1934-1935 (as found in the Metropolitan Opera Archives) shows that the earlier orchestra was by far more German than Italian. In 1934-1935, however, no fewer than fifty-three of eighty-five musicians on the permanent roster had incontestably Italian names...'  33 .     So, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, much like most other leading U.S. orchestras following World War 1 was made up of progressively more and more musicians of Italian and French as well as Russian training.  Similarly, following World War 2, and until today, these orchestras have included more and more American-trained musicians, coming out of the dozens of leading U.S. conservatories.  The fact of two massive World Wars devastated Europe in the first half of the Twentieth Century, and the rapid growth of U.S. conservatories such as the Curtis Institute, the Juilliard, Peabody, New England Conservatory, the music department of Indiana University, and many others all contributed to these changes.    These changes have continued to evolve until today, most U.S. orchestras, including the MET, are made up primarily of American-trained musicians, with a flavoring of European and increasingly Asian and Latin American trained musicians.        RETURN TO TOP      Titles of First Chair Musicians      Note:  Today, except for the concertmaster (sometimes called the 'Leader' in Europe), the usual title for the first or leading instrument of an orchestral section is 'Principal', as in 'Principal Flute'.  However, in earlier years and in some orchestra sections, the first chair musician may have been referred to as 'Solo', or 'First'.     In the profiles below, for consistency and clarity, I usually use the title 'Principal', even if the title was not yet used at that time.    Quick Navigation: Click Below to Jump to Principal Musician Sections     Conductors      Concertmasters   Cellos   Violas    Oboes   Bassoons   Clarinets    Flutes   Horns   Trumpets       Musicians of Other US Orchestras       Musicians of Other US Orchestras     Return to Top of Page    Navigation of site www.stokowski.org               The Concertmaster Title     The Concertmaster title:  Given the heavy performance load of an opera orchestra such as the Metropolitan, the orchestra has usually had 'assistant' or 'associate' Concertmasters to share the extensive performance workload.  As a result of James Levine's policies regarding the Orchestra, starting in 1980, the musician's workload was reduced to 4 days a week, raising standards and also requiring the hiring of many added musicians.  This also resulted in the new position of an additional Concertmaster.  Guy Lumia was the first of these added Concertmasters in 1984, alternating with Raymond Gniewek (who was Concertmaster for 43 years, 1957-2000).    Anne Mischakoff Heiles is a violist and gifted author of   America's Concertmasters   6 , and   Mischa Mischakoff: Journeys of a Concertmaster  (biography of her father).  In   America's Concertmasters  , her research demonstrates the difficulties of tracing all the musicians - even the concertmasters - of the Metropolitan Opera.  She states (page 281) "...It is telling that a company with an excellent archive of material about its singers and conductors lacks adequate records of its earlier orchestra members."  This is particularly striking, given the many famous musicians who graced the pit of the Metropolitan Opera house.  Anne Mischakoff Heiles' research, however, is able to document most of the history of the first chair of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, which is the source of much of the information displayed below.        RETURN TO TOP        Concertmasters of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra        1883 - 1884       Signor Ciofi   The "Signor Ciofi" or Mr. Ciofi listed in pay records records for the Concertmaster of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in its first season according to Anne Mischakoff Heiles  7 excellent research, but with no first name.  This is an example of the lack of detailed records regarding the Metropolitan orchestra members, as contrasted with the more detailed records as to the opera singers.  The name of Ciofi would suggest a native Italian from the Neapolitan or Sicilian area, where it is said the surname originated. However, no specific information about this violinist is yet known to me.        RETURN TO TOP      1883 - 1907       Nahan Franko    Nahan Franko was born in New Orleans July 23, 1861 into a large musical family (11 children).  His family lost all during the Civil War, the father, Hamman Franko being an ardent Confederate supporter.  Hamman Franco and his wife Helene Bergman Franko were German Jews who emigrated to Texas.  The original family name for Hamman Franco, a jeweler, was Hollander, a leading German Jewish family which also produced a number of musicians.  In 1864, following the occupation of New Orleans by Union forces, and Hamman's finances being threatened, the Franko family relocated to Germany,  Nahan Franko and his brother Sam Franko (1857-1937) studied with Heinrich Karl Hermann de Ahna (1835-1892) in Berlin - probably at the Berlin Akademische Hochschule für Musik where de Ahna taught under Joseph Joachim (1831-1907) direction.  Nahan's sister, Jeanne, was a pianist.  The Franko family returned to New York in 1869. Later, both Nahan and Sam Franko returned to Berlin for further study with Joachim and August Wilhelmj (1845-1908). Nahan Frank began as Concertmaster of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, according to Heiles  7 probably in 1883.  He of course did not play at the MET when it was closed 1897 - 1898.  Also, he did not play there in the 1904 - 1905 season after a disagreement with the conductor of the German repertoire Alfred Hertz (Hertz was later the conductor of the San Francisco Symphony).  As was the practice of that era when musicians sought constant work, Nahan Franko also seems to have at least sometimes acted as Concertmaster of the New York Symphony during this MET period.  Franko conducted more than 100 performances of the Metropolitan Opera in the first decade of the 1900s, including the series of Sunday evening orchestral concerts.  During the 1910s and 1920s, Nahan Franko also lead the 'Franko Orchestra' at concerts and social occasions. Nahan Franko died in Amityville, New York on June 7, 1930 subsequent to a stroke.        RETURN TO TOP      1884-1889, 1894-1899       Carlos Hasselbrink    Carlos Enrique Frederico Auguste Hasselbrink was born on July 23 or 24, 1858  24 in Barranquilla, Columbia of a French father, Charles Hasselbrink and Cuban mother, Leocadia Muraillat.  Carlos Hasselbrink grew up in Cuba, where he studied violin before going to France to study under the Belgian-born violinist, teacher and composer Hubert Leonard (1819-1890).  Hasselbrink emigrated to the U.S. in 1880.  In 1884 he was Concertmaster with the New York Symphony, and apparently, according to Anne Mischakoff Heiles, also Concertmaster of the Metropolitan Opera.  (From 1883 to 1891, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra was made up primarily of musicians of the New York Symphony.)  Hasselbrink was active as a concert musician in New York in 1894.  Hasselbrink later taught at the Institute of Musical Art (the predecessor of Juilliard) in New York City 1906-1932.  In 1928, Carlos Hasselbrink moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut where he died on October 4, 1946.     Carlos Hasselbrink in 1888         RETURN TO TOP      1904       Max Guhlke   Max Guhlke, born in New York in 1879, was listed to replace Nahan Franko in 1904 as Concertmaster, following 10 years of study in Germany, but Guhlke killed himself on October 27, 1904.  Newspaper accounts at the time said he "...ended his life with a revolver shot.  It was joy and not sorrow that overcame him...For one hour before, he had received a telegram from Nahan Franko, conductor of the Metropolitan Opera House Orchestra, welcoming him home from his studies in Germany and ordering him to report for rehearsal as first violin of the famous orchestra..."  8        RETURN TO TOP      1904 - 1905       Max Bendix    Max Bendix was born in March 28, 1866 in Detroit, Michigan.  Max Bendix had a long relationship with Theodore Thomas, joining the Thomas orchestra at the Cincinnati May Festival in 1878, when Bendix was only 12  6 .  In 1880, he became Concertmaster of the Cincinnati Orchestra under the conductor Maratsek (a musician I have not been able to identify)  6 . In about 1883-1884, Bendix was Concertmaster of the    Germania Orchestra of Philadelphia   .   In 1885-1886, still only 19, Bendix was a first violin in the first season of    Anton Seidl    at the Metropolitan Opera.  Also in the 1885-1886 season, Max Bendix was Concertmaster of the Arion Society of New York, a choral and orchestral society at that time conducted by    Frank Van der Stucken   .   In about 1886-1887, Max Bendix toured as Concertmaster with the Theodore Thomas Orchestra  6 , at least his second professional work with Theodore Thomas. Bendix spent the year 1889 studying in Europe, and in 1890 again was Concertmaster of the Thomas orchestra at the Cincinnati May Festive.  Then, when in the Autumn of 1891 Theodore Thomas created the first season of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (then called the "Chicago Orchestra"),   Thomas again selected Max Bendix as his Concertmaster.  In 1893, Chicago organized the World's Columbian Exposition, celebrating the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America.  According to Russell, Theodore Thomas did not want to become Music Director of the Exposition, given his bad experiences in Philadelphia in 1876, but reluctantly accepted  7 .  The Thomas misgivings proved founded, and after months of internecine politics at the Exposition, Thomas finally resigned in August, 1893  7 .  It seems that the Chicago Orchestra did continue to perform at the Exposition, but under the leadership of Max Bendix, which Theodore Thomas likely resented. In any case, Max Bendix had the reputation of a difficult and sensitive artist, and there was a series of confrontations between the two men during Bendix's tenure at the Chicago Orchestra.  Max Bendix did not return to the Chicago orchestra in the 1896-1897 season.  The New York Times on September 18, 1896, in an article apparently based on the Bendix view, reported "...the breach between the old friends [Theodore Thomas and Max Bendix], which began when Bendix took charge of the orchestra when Thomas left it in a huff, during the World's Fair, has gradually widened, and this year, Bendix was not given a renewal of his contract. Arthur Mees of New York will be assistant conductor in his place, and will be billed as such - an honor Mr. Thomas never accorded to Bendix."  In 1897-1898, Max Bendix made a U.S. transcontinental tour with Eugène Ysaÿe (1858-1931), violin, Henri Marteau (1874-1934), violin, Jean Gerardy (1877-1929), cello, Aimé Lachaume (1877-1944), piano.     The turbulent career of Bendix also included extensive conducting.  He conducted the St. Louis World's Fair orchestra in 1904.  Bendix became Concertmaster of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in the 1904 -1905 season under     Van der Stucken   .   Max Bendix also conducted at the Metropolitan Opera starting in 1905.  In 1907, in yet another shift, Bendix went to the rival Manhattan Opera Company as Concertmaster and assistant conductor, under the Music Director Cleofonte Campanini (1860-1919), where he conducted the Sunday night orchestral concerts.  Max Bendix also conducted an orchestra briefly in San Francisco.  At the end of the San Francisco Symphony 1918-1919 season under Music Director Alfred Hertz, there was reported dissention by some San Francisco Symphony musicians, who organized the 'People's Philharmonic Orchestra'  70 .  They invited Nikolai Sokoloff (1886-1965) to be their conductor.  This group played during the summer of 1919, but meanwhile, the San Francisco Orchestra directors raised money and hired new musicians to replace the defectors.  The People's Philharmonic Orchestra tried to continue with Max Bendix as their conductor, presenting popular concerts in San Francisco, but eventually failed  70 .   Max Bendix died in Chicago December 6, 1945, age 79 after an eventful career, having played a pioneering role in the development and expansion of US orchestras.        RETURN TO TOP      1910 - 1914       Eugene Boegner   Eugene Boegner (or Eugen Bögner) was born March 3, 1870 in Strehlen, at that time in Prussia, Germany, and now at the southwest boarder of Poland.  Boegner emigrated to the U.S. in September, 1891 to join Theodore Thomas in the inaugural 1891-1892 season of the Chicago Orchestra.  Eugene Boegner played in the first violin section of the Theodore Thomas Chicago Orchestra (the Chicago Symphony) for six seasons, 1891 - 1897.  Also in the 1890s, Boegner joined Bernard Listemann in the Listemann String Quartet, consisting of Listemann, first violin, Bruno Kuehn, second, Eugene Boegner (1870- ) viola, and Bruno Steindel, cello.  Kuehn, Boegner, and Steindel were at that time all colleagues in the Chicago Orchestra.  Eugene Boegner then joined the first violins of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, under the leadership of Nahan Franko in the 1897-1898 season.  Boegner remained as a first violin until the 1910-1911 season, when he was appointed Concertmaster.  Eugene Boegner continued in the Concertmaster chair for four seasons until the end of the 1913-1914 season.  Continuing with his chamber music career, shortly after joining the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, Boegner became a member of the Morgan Quartet, consisting of Geraldine Morgan, first, Eugene Boegner, second, Fritz Schaefer, viola, and Paul Morgan, cello.  Geraldine Morgan studied in Europe with several of the same teachers as Maud Powell (1867-1920), including Joseph Joachim (1831-1907).  This quartet continued at least until the 1900-1901 season. Eugene Boegner became a U.S. citizen in 1904.  He returned to Germany in the summer of 1916, with no subsequent record of his musical activity in the U.S. thereafter.  So, he may have remained in Germany during World War 1 and thereafter.        RETURN TO TOP      1914 - 1922       Gino Nastrucci     Gino Nastrucci in 1922, with wife Emilia, and daughters Anna Marie and Geraldine    Gino Nastrucci was born in Busseto, near Parma in the north of Italy on January 18, 1879.  Gino Nastrucci’s father, Francisco, was a violin teacher in Busseto, which also was Verdi’s home town. From 1904-1913, Gino Nastrucci was Concertmaster at La Scala, Milan, first under Toscanini (1898 – 1908) and then under Tullio Serafin (1909 – 1914)  21,22 .  Toscanini, who was at the Metropolitan Opera from 1908-1915 invited Gino Nastrucci to come to the Metropolitan Orchestra in 1913. Nastrucci was a long-time friend of Toscanini, and Sacchi says that Nastrucci was 'always cheerful, always joking'  21 . Gino Nastrucci came to the U.S. in September, 1913.  The Musician’s Union agreed to waive the 6 months waiting period, and Nastrucci joined the orchestra in November for the 1913-1914 season as Concertmaster  22 .  1914-1915 was Toscanini’s last season at the Met.  Nastrucci served as Concertmaster of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra for eight seasons.  Nastrucci also played with the New York Symphony during their European Tour of France, Italy Belgium, Netherlands, and England in May and June of 1920.  Gino Nastrucci also performed with Metropolitan Opera conductor Artur Bodanzky at the New York 'Friends of Music' concerts.  In about 1924, Gino Nastrucci seems to have returned to Italy, and performed in Europe.  From 1925-1927, Nastrucci seems to have served as a musician on Italian cruise ships on a series of crossings of the Atlantic.  In 1927 Nastrucci is listed as conducting in Wiesbaden, Germany.  From about 1930, Gino Nastrucci had returned to conduct at La Scala Milan.  From 1927 into the early 1930s Nastrucci made a number of operatic recordings with La Scala forces.

During this 1925-1926 season, Henrotte was Concertmaster of the Minneapolis Symphony, but was unhappy there, and returned to the Metropolitan Opera beginning with the 1926 - 1927 season.  Pierre Henrotte also conducted the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra for special concerts, and later at the Curtis Institute also instructed in conducting and solfège.  He died in St. Augustine, Florida on January 1, 1974.

RETURN TO TOP        A Note About Metropolitan Opera Orchestra Woodwinds and Brass       One of the advantages for the Metropolitan Opera woodwinds and brass musicians was that starting in about 1954, and during the remainder of the twentieth century, each woodwind or brass chair had two musicians, each of whom would play half of the performances.  Such doubling was necessary, since playing six or more performances each week, comprising different operas would be too much for a bassoon or a horn player to sustain, without burn-out or loss of performance quality.  For this reason, there were Principal players and "alternate Principal" or "Associate Principal" players, or sometimes "Co-Principal", sometimes with the Principal having an edge in stature over the Associate Principal, either through seniority, or by reputation.  In other cases, the two Principal players were considered as equals, and as alternates.  The woodwind and brass musician listings below seek, where possible to reflect the situation during each decade.    Quick Navigation: Click Below to Jump to Principal Musician Sections     Conductors      Concertmasters   Cellos   Violas    Oboes   Bassoons   Clarinets    Flutes   Horns   Trumpets       Musicians of Other US Orchestras       Musicians of Other US Orchestras     Return to Top of Page    Navigation of site www.stokowski.org              Principal Oboe     Marc Lifschey said '...the oboe is the Queen of the woodwinds, unrivaled by any other instrument of the section in its authoritative tone.'  57    1900-1911(?)       Adolph Bertram    Adolph Bertram was born in Germany in August, 1870.  He came to the U.S. in 1889.  In Chicago, Adolph Bertram was second oboe of the Chicago Symphony (at that time the "Chicago Orchestra") , under Theodore Thomas 1893-1896.  By 1900, Adolph Bertram was Principal oboe in the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, where he remained at least until 1910.  For the 1911-1912 initial San Francisco Symphony season, Henry Hadley brought Adolph Bertram with him as Principal oboe.  Bertram remained Principal oboe for three seasons 1911-1914.  Adolph Bertram also was Principal oboe in the orchestra of the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco.  In 1919-1922 Adolph Bertram moved to St. Louis, where he was Principal oboe and sometimes English horn in the St. Louis Symphony under Max Zach and Rudolf Ganz  37 .  Adolph Bertram seems to have died young, prior to 1930.

Haynes and Co. in 1898. Wehner liked the flute so much that he purchased it for one hundred dollars and subsequently was responsible for the sale of six more Haynes flutes to his friends and colleagues...", which helped establish Haynes’s reputation  15 .  However, it seems Wehner did not like metal flutes.  Leonardo De Lorenzo, a student of Carl Wehner stated "...I regret to say that Carl Wehner's hatred for the metal flute was excessive and exaggerated.  In spite of his financial difficulties in his last years, he would never hear or teach anyone with a metal flute!"  16 .  Georges Barrère was gaining new flute students at Wehner's expense  63 .  Flutists were more and more prefering the lighter French sound played with a metal flute.  Carl Wehner died in New York City in 1912.    1905 - 1913      Otto Carl Friedrich Stoeckert (or Stöckert)    Otto Stoeckert was born in Germany in 1861.   He emigrated to the U.S. in 1884, and settled in New York City.  Stoeckert played in numerous concert groups in New York City during the 1890s.   Otto Stoeckert became Principal flute in the Seidl Orchestra that    Anton Seidl    organized in 1897, which likely would have continued except for the event of Seidl's sudden death in 1898.  Otto Stoeckert was later a flutist in the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra at least from 1905, and was Principal flutist at the MET at least from 1906 until 1913.  As did most other musicians of this era, Stoeckert played in summer festival orchestras in the 1910s. Stoeckert is also listed by the Chicago Symphony archives as being Principal flute with the Chicago Symphony in 1907, apparently for less than a full season.  Stoeckert also seems to have been a former first flutist with the New York Philharmonic.     1913 - 1919       Giuseppe Brugnoli   Giuseppe Brugnoli was born in Borgotaro, near L'Aquila (100 km northeast of Rome), Italy August 4, 1873.  Brugnoli was solo flute under Toscanini at La Scala, Milan and also of the Orchestra del teatro Augusteo di Roma  63 .  At the Metropolitan, he was referred to as "the flute of Toscanini".  After his six seasons at the Metropolitan Opera, he returned in 1920 to join Arturo Toscanini at the famous reopening (with Falstaff) of La Scala, Milan in 1921.  Giuseppe Brugnoli died in Italy in 1952  63 .    1919 - 1935       Nicola (or Nicholas) Laucella   Nicola Laucella, who in public records referred to himself as Nicholas Laucella, was born in the Avellino province, east of Naples, Italy on July 1, 1882, and emigrated to the U.S. in 1895.  Laucella during 1904-1907 was either a flute or the solo flute of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra  14 .  Nicola Laucella was Principal flute of the New York Philharmonic 1909-1911, and then stayed with the Philharmonic until the end of the 1918-1919 season.  In the 1919-1920 season, Nicola Laucella became Principal flute of the Metropolitan Opera orchestra, where he stayed for 17 seasons.  In 1920, Nicola Laucella made three flute recordings for the Victor Talking Machine Company with the Peruvian composer Daniel Alomia Robles (1871-1942), but these recordings were not issued  69 .  We do however have recordings of Nicola Laucella playing, such as this Wolf-Ferrari aria from  'I gioielli della Madonna' sung March 24, 1930 by Giuseppe De Luca (1876-1950), Metropolitan Opera star, with Nicola Laucella, flute obbligato.         baritone Giuseppe De Luca (1876-1950)     Click here to listen to Laucella and De Luca in 'Aprila, bella' from 1930     .  Nicola Laucella composed a string quartet, a number of concerti, and a flute trio, and several of his orchestral works were performed at about the time of World War 1.  Nicola Laucella died on April 3, 1952.   1935 - 1938       Ewald Bernard Haun   Ewald Haun was born in Homestead, Pennsylvania (suburban Pittsburgh) December 7, 1891 of German parents.  He was trained in both piano and flute.  He studied music in Germany with Barlassieve  12 .  In the 1910s, he worked as a musician in Cincinnati, including as a hotel musician, both in piano and flute.  Haun played flute with the Cincinnati Symphony 1920 - 1926.  He provided piano accompaniment for singers, including Amelita Galli-Curci in tour on in the 1920s.  Ewald Haun also performed on flute with the Atwater-Kent Orchestra under    Louis Edlin     in 1926.  He played in New York orchestras in the 1920s.  Haun also conducted radio orchestras in the early 1930s.  He died in January, 1939 from heart disease.   1937 - 1944       Arthur Lora    Arthur Lora was born in the Novale province of Vicenza, Italy on March 11, 1903.  In 1907, his family emigrated to the U.S., settling in Rhode Island.  In 1916, when his family moved to New York, Lora decided to follow a career as a flutist.  His was a musical family, with his brother Alfred Lora becoming a violinist with the New York Philharmonic, and his brother Antonio Lora being a pianist and composer who also studied and taught at Juilliard.  In 1919 at age 16, Arthur Lora enrolled in the Institute of Art (Juilliard) where he studied flute under the legendary Georges Barrère (1876-1944).  Arthur Lora graduated from Juilliard in 1923.  Lora then became Principal flute with the State Symphony of New York under Ernst von Dohnányi (1877-1960)  26 .  Beginning in 1926, Lora was Georges Barrère's assistant at the Institute of Musical Art, teaching flute, which he continued for the next thirty years.  Arthur Lora was active with the New York Chamber Music Society from 1921-1936  62 .  During 1928-1936, Arthur Lora was first flute for the NBC radio broadcast orchestra, a desirable post since it was year-around employment, at a time when orchestra musicians might play for a 24 or 30 week season.  Then, in 1937, Arthur Lora became Principal flute of the Metropolitan opera for seven seasons 1937-1944.  Following the death of Georges Barrère in 1944, Lora succeeded him as head of the flute program at Juilliard  62 , where he continued into the 1970s.  Lora became Principal Flute of the NBC Symphony Orchestra under Toscanini 1948-1952, succeeding Carmine Coppola.  As well as teaching at the Juilliard School in the 1950s and 1960s, Lora was also active as a New York session recording musician, and played Broadway shows (e.g. Stoppard's 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead').  Lora was also interested in musical scholarship, and certain forgotten works, such as the compositions of C.P.E. Bach.  Arthur Lora died on November 28, 1992 in Santa Barbara, California.     1944 - 1965       Harold Bennett   Harold Bennett was born in Casper, Wyoming on August 27, 1913. He studied with William Kincaid at the Curtis Institute where he graduated in 1935  99 . Harold Bennett, after graduating from Curtis was from 1935-1937 Principal flute of the National Symphony in Washington, D.C. under Hans Kindler.   Harold Bennett then went to New York, where he was Principal flute with the Radio City Music Hall orchestra, an attractive, year-around job.  Bennett then went to the Pittsburgh Symphony as Principal Flute under Fritz Reiner, 1938-1940.  Bennett went from Pittsburge to Philadelphia in the 1940-1941 season.  In Philadelphia, he was assistant Principal flute and piccolo in the Philadelphia Orchestra, sitting next to his teacher and colleague William Kincaid during the War, 1940-1944.  After Philadelphia, Harold Bennett was principal flute for the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra for 21 seasons from 1944-1965.  During much of his tenure at the Metropolitan, Bennett also performed radio, and later television concerts ('The Voice of Firestone') and recorded regularly with the New York-based Firestone Orchestra 1938-1960, under Howard Barlow.  Harold Bennett later said that he had developed a device to prevent the flute from losing its pitch with the change in temperature.  This bears further research!  Incidentally, Harold Bennett was not related to Henry Fillmore (1881-1956), the composer of many marches, who used the name Harold Bennett as a pseudonym.  Beginning in 1962, Harold Bennett taught flute at the Manhattan School of Music  99 .   Harold Bennett died of a heart attack on September 17, 1985 in Jackson Heights, New York.    1956 - 1976      James Dimitri Politis   James Politis was born September 2, 1921 in New York City of Greek parents.  He studied flute under John R.

Reiter    Picture of Xavier Reiter (courtesy of Gregg Squires)   Xavier Reiter was born in Munich, Germany in March 1857.  He came to the United States in 1886 to join the Boston Symphony as Principal horn under Wilhelm Gericke.  Reiter settled in Boston and he became a citizen in 1890.  Reiter was often during his career in Boston and New York referred to is the greatest horn player in the U.S.  As well as being a gifted horn player, Reiter was apparently what we refer to as a "character".  He wore his hair down over his shoulders and also a beard and full moustache, as can be seen in the photograph below.  His total appearance seems to have been something like Buffalo Bill.  In the January 14, 1890 New York Times article entitled "A Missing Horn Player", it further states that Reiter "...wears a big, broad-brimmed Texas slouch hat...and his manly form is enrapped in a big fur overcoat..." 102   According to David Mannes autobiography, it seems that Reiter decided to leave Boston and the BSO when he and his two large Russian Wolfhounds were arrested in the Boston Commons for bathing his dogs in a public fountain  103 .  It would seem difficult to be arrested for such a reason, but then Reiter was 'larger than life'.  This image is reinforced by an amusing account by the great horn player Milan Yancich (brother of Charles Yancich) about Xavier Reiter.  '...[Reiter's] transportation was a bicycle. He often wore a tam and a cape training in the wind. He looked like Count Dracula in persuit of a victim. His horn was slung across his back as he rode across the Boston Commons on his bicycle...' 104 .      After 1890, Reiter became Principal horn of the New York Philharmonic Society during the 1910s.  At that time, he also helped form the Philharmonic Ensemble, a wind quintet with violin consisting of     Henri Leroy     clarinet, Xavier Reiter horn, August Mesnard bassoon, Anton Fayer flute, and joined by     Leopold Kramer     , then Concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic  146 .  Earlier, in the 1900s, Reiter was Principal horn of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra under Seidel, where he could enjoy his favorite operas, particularly Wagner.  It is said that Reiter was instrumental in convincing his town in Westchester County, New York to rename itself "Valhalla", Reiter being an avid admirer of Richard Wagner and his Ring cycle.  Bruno Jaenicke, the great Boston horn player (1913-1918) and later Principal horn of the New York Philharmonic wrote of Reiter (in an article edited by that other great Boston Symphony horn, Harold Meek 1943-1963) '... I want to mention a horn player who uses the B-flat horn, but whose tone is as velvety and as poetical as that of any F horn players I have known. He is Mr. Xavier Reiter. I remember the first impression which his playing made on me. It was in Boston about 14 years ago. The New York Philharmonic played in Symphony Hall. Mischa Elman played the Scotch Fantasy, but when Reiter had the melody for only a few bars, he overshadowed Elman. But Reiter can sing on his horn. And we other fellows better stick to the F horn.'  105 .  Xavier Reiter died in May, 1938.     (note: The photo of Xavier Reiter was kindly sent to me by Gregg Squires, himself a horn player in both the Buffalo Philharmonic and the Radio City Music Hall orchestra.  Gregg is a music producer and you can visit him at his site  http://www.squiresproductions.com/   Thanks Gregg! )     1906-at least 1907      Hermann Hand   Hermann (or Herman) Hand was born in Vienna.  Hand was a horn student of Josef Schandel in Vienna  59 .  Hand was a Principal horn at the Vienna Staatsoper.  In New York, Hand was one of the initial teachers at the Institute of Musical Art  59 .  During the 1905-1906 season, Hermann Hand was Principal horn of the New York Symphony under Walter Damrosch.  Hand was Principal horn of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra at least during 1906-1907, and perhaps in the two later seasons.  Hand was in 1910-1911 a horn in the Sousa Band  98 .     1910-1911      Richard Otto Lindenhahn    Richard Lindenhahn born in Germany June 13, 1877.  He played horn in Amsterdam, prior to relocation to New York in 1909.  He joined the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in 1909-1910 season, and became Principal MET horn in the 1910-1911 season.  For 23 1/2 seasons, from 1911 - 1934, Richard Lindenhahn was Principal horn of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra under conductors Emil Oberhoffer (1867-1933) and Henri Verbrugghen (1873-1934).  Lindenhahn also taught horn at the University of Minnesota during the period he was at Minneapolis.  Lindenhahn played for a time in the Sousa Band.  Richard Lindenhahn died in November 7, 1934 in Minneapolis at age 57 after having hurried to a rehearsal of Ein Heldenleben  27 .     193x-1945       Joseph Avallone   Joseph Avallone was born in Salerno, Italy January 1, 1895, and came to the U.S. with his family in 1911.  He began study of the horn in Italy when he was 7.     1945-1959      Gunther Schuller    Gunther Schuller born November 22, 1925 in New York to a New York Philharmonic violinist father.  He was at age 17, Principal horn of the Cincinnati Symphony 1943-45.

Church.  In the United States at the time, and until about the 1930s, there was a great entertainment tradition of cornet solo playing with bands, lost in today's availability of music from numerous sources.  In 1893, Clarke joined the Sousa Band as a cornet soloist.  In 1893, Clarke also played in the Chicago World's Fair, continuing to play with different bands during the mid-1890s.  In about the 1898-1899 season, Herbert L.
