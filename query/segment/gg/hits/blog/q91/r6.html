	The Metropolitan Opera was incorporated in 1880 by wealthy sponsors.&nbsp; 
	The MET's inaugural season began on October 23, 1883 at its opera house 
	at 39th and Broadway with a performance of Gounod's Faust.&nbsp; The Metropolitan 
	Opera history since has been studded with so many famous names and historic 
	performances they surpass any short listing.&nbsp; This is true also of its 
	orchestra, although as we will see, the history of orchestra and musicians of 
	the Metropolitan Opera is less well documented.&nbsp;
	</p>&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
	From the MET's initial performances in 1883, until 1891, the musicians who formed 
	the Orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera were, for the most part, from the New 
	York Symphony, particularly musicians other than the Principals.&nbsp; 
	This would change beginning in the 1893-1894 season.
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
	&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
	<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
	In looking at the chronology of the Metropolitan, there are two 
	gaps in its performing chronology, which of course also affect the Metropolitan 
	Opera Orchestra.&nbsp; First is the season 1892 - 1893, when the Metropolitan did 
	not perform due to a disastrous fire of August 27, 1892 that destroyed most 
	of its building, and many instruments and association records.&nbsp; 
	The Metropolitan Opera was also closed during the 1897-1898 season.&nbsp; During 
	that season, the Opera house was leased to Maurice Grau and hosted only visiting 
	opera groups.&nbsp; Grau took over full directorship in 1898, after which the 
	Metropolitan flourished.

	With the re-opening of the Metropolitan Opera in 1893, the 'Golden Age' arrived 
	under the direction of Maurice Grau, who took over management in October, 1891
	<sup>1</sup> until 1903.&nbsp; Grau died in Paris on March 14, 1907, of heart 
	disease <sup>18</sup>.&nbsp; Grau was followed by two other greats: Heinrich 
	Conried 1903 - 1908 and the superbly organized and innovative Giulio 
	Gatti-Casazza for 25 years from 1908 - 1935.&nbsp; It was said of Gatti-Casazza 
	that he spoke no English - perhaps an exaggeration, and perhaps also a convenient 
	role for him.&nbsp; One of the most famous MET General Managers was Rudolf Bing 
	(later in 1971, Sir Rudolf) who reined (not an exaggeration) from 1950 to 
	1972.&nbsp; During this period, Bing was frequently accused of avoiding 
	giving authority to any eminent conductor, and fearing the competition of a 
	Music Director.&nbsp; Nevertheless, many of the leading conducting names 
	worked at the MET during Bing's regime, including George Szell, Fritz Reiner, 
	Dimitri Mitropoulos, and even Herbert von Karajan.

	Anton Seidl (1850-1898) was a Hungarian operatic conductor, born in Budapest 
	May 7, 1850.  Seidl studied at the Leipzig Conservatory from October 1870-1872.  
	Seidl then went to Bayreuth as one of Richard Wagner's copyists, 
	living in Wagner's home. At Bayreuth, Seidl assisted in the creation of the first 
	copy of the score of Das Ring des Nibelungen. As a consequence, Seidl was at the 
	first Bayreuth Festival in the Summer of 1876.  An important opportunity 
	for Seidl resulted from Wagner's recommendation of Seidl as conductor of the Leipzig 
	Stadt-Theater.&nbsp; Seidl conducted in Leipzig from 1878-1882, to be succeeded by 
	his Hungarian contemporary, the young Artur Nikisch (1855-1922).&nbsp; Then, in 1882, Seidl 
	toured with the Angelo Neumann Nibelungen Ring Company.&nbsp; The conducting 
	reputation of Seidl was further consolidated during this tour.&nbsp; In 1885, Seidl 
	was appointed as successor to Leopold Damrosch, who had died (1832-1885) as conductor of the 
	German Repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera.  Also, during the Summers, beginning in 1886, 
	Seidl conducted at the Bayreuth Festival.&nbsp; From 1891-1898, Anton Seidl succeeded 
	Theodore Thomas as Music Director of the New York Philharmonic, where he enjoyed a 
	popularity of something like today's movie celebrities (never experienced by Theodore 
	Thomas).&nbsp; As a consequence, the Philharmonic Society of New York experienced new 
	financial prosperity.&nbsp; In 1897, Anton Seidl conducted in London at Covent Garden.&nbsp; 
	Also in 1897, Anton Seidl organized a symphony orchestra, the Seidl Orchestra so named, 
	that many thought would become a permanent New York feature, given the financial 
	backing of the many Seidl admirers.&nbsp; However,  Anton Seidl died suddenly in New York City 
	on March 28, 1898, not yet age 48, seemingly of food poisoning.&nbsp; The conducting style of 
	Seidl is said to have been characterized by free tempi and interpretation, even of established 
	classics, such as Beethoven, which divided listeners and critics of the era.&nbsp;

	Walter Damrosch was born in Breslau, Prussia, some 100 km east of 
	Dresden (now Wroclaw, Poland) on January 13, 1862, son of 
	the conductor Leopold Damrosch (1832-1885).&nbsp; Walter Damrosch, as 
	well as studying under his father, attended the Dresden Conservatory, 
	where he studied with Wilhelm Albert Rischbieter (1834-1910) and Felix 
	Draeseke (1835-1913).&nbsp; The Damrosch 
	family emigrated to the U.S. in 1871, a year after Leopold Damrosch 
	had visited the U.S. and found it welcoming.&nbsp; Walter began conducting 
	both oratorio society and concerts under his father, Leopold who became 
	conductor of the German repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in 1884.&nbsp; 
	At that time, Walter Damrosch was an assistant conductor, and advanced to the 
	German repertoire under Seidl when Leopold Damrosch died in 1885.&nbsp; 
	At the MET, Walter Damrosch was respected in his conducting of Wagner, although 
	contemporary critics wrote that he did not reach the heights of contemporaries 
	such as Hertz, and well short of the very different approaches of Mahler or 
	Toscanini.&nbsp; Walter Damrosch was also a successful symphonic conductor.&nbsp; 
	Leopold Damrosch had founded the New York Symphony Society (in 1903, renamed the New 
	Symphony) in 1878, which Walter Damrosch took over in 1885 upon his father's 
	death.&nbsp; Walter Damrosch had a successful relationship with Andrew Carnegie 
	which resulted in Carnegie funding of the Symphony Society, and the funding of 
	the construction of Carnegie Hall, opened in 1891.&nbsp; This was a Damrosch strength 
	of which the New York Times said '...he has the shrewdness in business matters denied 
	most musicians...' <sup>97</sup>.&nbsp; Andrew Carnegie also supported the 
	1920 tour of the New York Symphony in Europe, the first U.S. orchestra to make such 
	a tour.&nbsp; During the 1920s, Damrosch progressively conducted symphony concerts less 
	and less, and beginning 1927, became Music Director for NBC radio.&nbsp; At NBC, Damrosch 
	lead a successful classical music appreciation program, directed at youths, and which 
	continued until 1942.&nbsp; Damrosch was also a composer, including of at least 
	four operas, including 'The Scarlet Letter' premiered in 1895 <sup>
	96</sup>.&nbsp; These works are 
	generally forgotten today.&nbsp; Walter Damrosch died in 
	New York City December 22, 1950 of a heart attack <sup>95</sup>.

	Frank Van der Stucken was born in Fredericksburg, Texas on October 
	15, 1858.&nbsp; In 1866, Van de Stucken went to Antwerp with his 
	parents.&nbsp; Van der Stucken's father, Frank (1830 - circa 1908), 
	was born and raised in Antwerp, and came to Texas.&nbsp; After 
	serving as a Captain in the Confederate Army, Frank Van der Stucken, 
	Sr. found himself on the wrong side of the after-war society.&nbsp; 
	He therefore took the family back to Antwerp.&nbsp; There, Frank Van 
	der Stucken Jr. studied violin with Émile Wambach (1854-1924) from 
	1866 to 1876 and composition and theory with the Belgian composer 
	Peter Benoit (1834-1901).&nbsp; Frank Van der Stucken then went to 
	Leipzig where he studied with Carl Reinecke (1824-1910) during 
	1876 - 1878 as well as with Edvard Grieg (1843-1907) and Hermann 
	Langer (1819–1889) who was then Universitätsmusikdirektor at 
	Leipzig.&nbsp; Van der Stucken learned conducting by the traditional 
	European method of being a regional kapellmeister, first at 
	the Stadttheater Breslau, Prussia (now Wroclaw, Poland) in 
	1881-1882.&nbsp; Van den Stucken was introduced to Franz Liszt 
	at Weimar by his teacher Edvard Grieg in 1883.&nbsp; From 1879 to 
	1881 Van der Stucken traveled throughout Europe and met and 
	worked with Giuseppe Verdi, Emmanuel Chabrier, and Jules 
	Massenet.&nbsp; In about 1883, Frank Van der Stucken moved 
	to New York where he succeeded Leopold Damrosch as 
	conductor of the Arion Society (a choral and orchestral 
	society) from 1884-1895.&nbsp; According to Hubbard 
	<sup>19</sup>,

	&nbsp;was the Concertmaster 
	of the Arion Society orchestra (among other orchestral and 
	chamber music jobs) under Van der Stucken in the 1885-1886 
	season.&nbsp; Van der Stucken gave concerts with the Arion 
	Society championing music of American composers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Van der Stucken was appointed the first conductor of the 
	Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra serving from 1895-1907.&nbsp; From 
	about 1901 to about 1907, he conducted frequently at the 
	Metropolitan Opera.&nbsp; Van der Stucken also continued his 
	Cincinnati connection for many years.&nbsp; He directed the 
	Cincinnati May Festival, from 1906-1912 and 1923-1927 (in 
	earlier years, the Festival was only every second year).&nbsp; 
	Frank van der Stucken returned for the Cincinnati festivals from 
	Europe.&nbsp; He had relocated to Germany in 1908.&nbsp; Van der 
	Stucken again conducted the Cincinnati May Festival in 1923, and 
	was its Music Director in 1925&nbsp; and 1927.&nbsp; Van 
	der Stucken's last trip to the United States was in was in 
	October 1928 for celebrations of his 70th birthday with friends 
	and admirers in New York and Cincinnati.&nbsp; Frank Van der Stucken 
	died in Hamburg, Germany on August 16, 1929.

	Alfred Hertz was born in Frankfurt, Germany on July 15, 1872.&nbsp; In the 
	late 1880s, Hertz entered the newly formed Raff Konservatorium in Frankfurt, 
	studying piano and composition under Anton Urspruch (1850-1907).&nbsp;  In 
	1892, Alfred Hertz began the usual path in Germany for learning conducting, 
	by entering a regional theater, the Hoftheatre of the small 
	town of Altenberg, Germany, 30 km south of Dresden.&nbsp; Hertz stayed in 
	Altenberg for three seasons, 1892-1895, before going to the Stadttheater 
	of Barmen-Elberfeld (renamed Wuppertal after 1930), near Stuttgart during 
	1895-1899.&nbsp; Hertz then went to the much larger city of Breslau, 100 km 
	east of Dresden (Breslau now being in Poland, with the name of 
	Wroclaw).&nbsp; From 1899-1902, Hertz conducted at the Stadttheater 
	Breslau (where Frank Van der Stucken had also conducted during the 1881-1882 
	season).&nbsp; In 1902, Alfred Hertz made the large jump to the Metropolitan 
	Opera, where he became the principal conductor of the Germany repertory, 
	succeeding Walter Damrosch.&nbsp; Hertz was well received in New York, 
	although some critics thought his orchestra drowned out many of the 
	singers.&nbsp; On December 24, 1903, Alfred Hertz at the MET was the first to 
	conduct Parsifal outside of Wagner's Bayreuth, causing a controversy.&nbsp; 
	For a time, all German opera houses would not engage Hertz because of 
	this.&nbsp; We can still hear Hertz's early interpretation of music from 
	Parsifal in the September, 1913 recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic, 
	beautifully restored by Mark Obert-Thorn on Naxos Historical 8.110049 and 
	8.110050.&nbsp; During his tenure at the Metropolitan Opera, Hertz 
	toured the U.S. regularly, including in San Francisco during the great 
	earthquake of 1906.&nbsp; Hertz left the Metropolitan opera at the end of the 
	1912-1913 season, and went to Los Angeles that summer of 1913 to conduct 
	at the Panama Exposition.&nbsp; Hertz then returned to Germany for the 
	1913-1914 season, where he conducted, among others, the Berlin Philharmonic 
	which also led to the famous Parsifal recording.&nbsp; In 1915, Hertz 
	came to San Francisco to direct a festival of Beethoven's music, when 
	he was offered direction of the San Francisco Symphony.&nbsp; So, in the 
	1915-1916 season, Alfred Hertz became Music Director of the San Francisco 
	Symphony, where he remained for 15 seasons.&nbsp; In 1917, when the U.S. entered 
	World War 1, Hertz became a U.S. citizen.&nbsp; When Victor opened its facilities 
	in Oakland, California, across the San Francisco Bay, Hertz led the San Francisco 
	Symphony in a series of recordings 1925-1930.&nbsp; Many of these recordings 
	in excellent restorations by Mark Obert-Thorn are available from Andrew Rose's 
	superb Pristine Classical (www.pristineclassical.com).&nbsp; After his farewell 
	San Francisco Symphony concert on April 30, 1930, Hertz remained in 
	California, living in Berkeley, where he endowed Hertz Hall at the 
	University of California, Berkeley.&nbsp; Hertz also conducted for radio 
	in the 1930s for the Standard Symphony Hour on NBC.&nbsp; 
	Alfred Hertz died in San Francisco on April 17, 1942.

	Arturo Toscanini was born on March 25, 1867 in Parma, Italy in 
	the Emilia-Romagna, famous for its musical traditions.&nbsp; 
	In 1897, Toscanini entered the Parma Conservatory, 
	where he studied cello and solfège <sup>71</sup>.&nbsp; 
	He graduated in 1885 with distinction.&nbsp; The next year, in 1886, 
	Toscanini was traveling with a contract orchestra in Rio de Janeiro, 
	Brazil.&nbsp; In a famous incident, the local conductor, Leopoldo 
	Miguez (1850-1902) had been rejected by the singers, and after 
	several unsuccessful substitutes, Toscanini, the chorus master 
	took over the performance of Aida on June 30, 1886 <sup>71</sup>.&nbsp; Following 
	his South American successes, Toscanini conducted in Italy, but also 
	continued playing the cello.&nbsp; Toscanini was in the cello section 
	of the La Scala premiere of Verdi's Otello in 1887.&nbsp; As Toscanini's 
	conducting reputation grew, he was granted the world premieres of 
	the Leoncavallo - Pagliacci (1892) and Puccini - La Bohème (1896).&nbsp; 
	In 1898, Toscanini became Director of the Teatro alla Scala, Milan.&nbsp; 
	Toscanini devoted seven seasons to La Scala, 1898-1903 and 1906-1908.&nbsp; 
	During Toscanini's tenure at La Scala, he conducted first Italian performances 
	of Wagner - Siegfried, Tchaikovsky - Eugene Onegin, Strauss - Salome and 
	Debussy - Pelléas et Mélisande.&nbsp; Toscanini then accepted a similar post 
	with the Metropolitan Opera in the 1908-1909 season.&nbsp; In New York, 
	Toscanini was an instant favorite, and remained until the end of the 
	1914-1915 season.&nbsp; During Toscanini's tenure at the Metropolitan 
	Opera, he gave the world premiere of Puccini - La Fanciulla del 
	West, and U.S. premieres of Mussorgsky - Boris Godunov, and revivals of 
	historic works by Weber and Gluck.&nbsp; In 1915, 
	Toscanini returned to support Italy during World War 1.&nbsp; 
	Following the war, in 1920-1921, Toscanini toured the U.S. with the La Scala 
	Orchestra, making his first recordings with the Victor Talking Machine 
	Company in December, 1920 and March 1921 <sup>69</sup>.&nbsp; In 
	December 1921, after being closed 1918-1920, Toscanini reopened La Scala 
	with a famous performance of 'Falstaff'.&nbsp; After leaving La Scala, 
	Toscanini accepted to become co-conductor (with Willem Mengelberg) 
	of the of New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra, 1926-1930.&nbsp; Then, in 
	1930, following the merger of the Philharmonic Society of New York with 
	the New York Symphony Society Toscanini became its sole conductor.&nbsp; 
	Political developments also had an important effect on Toscanini's 
	career.&nbsp; In the early 1920s, Toscanini became disillusioned with Mussolini 
	and with fascism and repeatedly refused to conduct the Fascist anthem 
	<i>Giovinezza</i>.&nbsp; At a memorial concert for 
	Giuseppe Martucci in May, 1931 Toscanini was attacked by fascist blackshirts 
	when he again refused to conduct <i>Giovinezza</i>.&nbsp; Toscanini then abandoned 
	Italy.&nbsp; Toscanini was the first non-German conductor at Bayreuth at the 
	1930 and 1931 festivals.&nbsp; He also took the New York Philharmonic on a 
	European tour in 1930, including 
	at Bayreuth.&nbsp; 1934-1937, Toscanini conducted at the Salzburg Festival, but 
	withdrew in 1938 after the German anschluss of Austria.&nbsp; In 1936, Toscanini 
	accepted the Bronislaw Huberman (1882-1947) invitation to conduct the inaugural 
	concert of the Palestine Symphony <sup>72</sup>.&nbsp; 
	In 1937, on David Sarnoff's initiative the new NBC Symphony Orchestra was 
	formed for Toscanini who conducted the first broadcast concert on December 25, 
	1937.&nbsp; Toscanini continued to conduct the NBC Symphony until his famous 
	last concert on April 4, 1954.&nbsp; What more can be said or written about Toscanini, certainly 
	the most famous conductor of the Twentieth Century ?&nbsp; His precision, 
	dedication to perfection, his tantrums (another aspect of perfection), 
	his dedication to the score (although he, too, made changes), his 
	memory and above all, his genius.&nbsp; The reputation that his later 
	performances, rather than slowing, as did other conductors late in their 
	careers, such as Klemperer, Walter, Weingartner, instead sped up.&nbsp; 
	Some claimed they became too hard-driven.&nbsp; Although not always 
	true, there is in my view some truth in this opinion.&nbsp; Mortimer H. 
	Frank in his fascinating book <i><u>Arturo Toscanini - The NBC Years</u></i> 
	writes that this speeding up was '...the product of his rethinking of interpretive 
	problems...' <sup>73</sup>.&nbsp; Toscanini's later Wagner did not speed up, 
	and there was always a pulse in the music appropriate to the 
	score.&nbsp; However, Toscanini's earlier BBC recordings, and 
	particularly his New York Philharmonic recordings, which are few, also 
	contain some of his best work.&nbsp; His 1936 Philharmonic recording of 
	the Beethoven Symphony no 7 remains, for me, unsurpassed.&nbsp; I recommend 
	you download this legendary performance in Andrew Rose's

	Artur Bodanzky was born in Vienna, Austria on December 16, 1877 of Hungarian 
	parents Carl Bodanzky and Hanna Feuchtwang, neither of whom were particularly 
	musical.&nbsp; In the 1890s in Vienna, Bodanzky studied violin and composition 
	with the young Alexander Zemlinsky (1871-1942, later known for his conducting 
	and compositions).&nbsp; Bodanzky graduated from the Vienna Conservatory in 
	1896 <sup>36</sup>.&nbsp; Beginning in the 1896-1897 season, Bodanzky 
	played in the first violin section of the Vienna Opera <sup>36</sup>.&nbsp; 
	In about 1901, Bodanzky then became a conducting assistant 
	to Gustav Mahler at the Vienna Opera.&nbsp; Bodanzky then went to the 
	Komische Oper of Budweis in what was then referred to as Bohemia (now 
	Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic) in about 1904.&nbsp; Bodanzky conducted 
	opera and light opera in Paris, Russia, and Germany.&nbsp; 
	In the 1906-1909 seasons, Artur Bodanzky was conductor at the 
	Neues Deutsches Landestheater in Prague, where Otto Klemperer 
	also conducted from 1907-1910.&nbsp; After Prague, Bodanzky went to the 
	Mannheim Stadttheater as principal conductor and later Music Director 
	1909-1913.&nbsp; Bodanzky came 
	to the U.S. in October, 1915 to assume his duties 
	as principal conductor of the German repertory at the MET.&nbsp; Bodanzky had been 
	accepted by Toscanini, still then at the MET, with whom Bodanzky shared the conducting 
	of the German repertoire until Toscanini's departure one year later.&nbsp; 
	New York critics in 1916 favorably compared Bodanzky's performances of 
	Wagner with those of Toscanini.&nbsp; Bodanzky also became conductor 
	of the Society of Friends of Music which post he held 1916-1931.&nbsp; Bodanzky became 
	a U.S. citizen in 1921.&nbsp; At the end of the 1927-1928 season, Bodanzky resigned 
	from the Metropolitan Opera, and in the next season, Joseph Rosenstock was appointed 
	as principal conductor of the German repertoire.&nbsp; This selection of Rosenstock, 
	who had been conductor at the Stadtsoper, Wiesbaden <sup>35</sup>  
	proved unsuccessful, and Bodanzky was retained again in the 1929-1930 season, 
	where he remained until his death in 1939.&nbsp; Bodanzky was noted for the rapid 
	tempi of his conducting, including of the music of Wagner.&nbsp; He was also criticized 
	for the number of cuts he made to scores, even in an era that extensive cuts to 
	operas was the norm.&nbsp; Arthur Bodanzky suffered a heart attack on October 28, 
	1939, and died one month later on November 23, 1939  
	at the beginning of his twenty-fourth season at the Metropolitan Opera.

	Tullio Serafin was born in Rottanova di Cavarzere, Italy, near Venice on September 1, 1878.&nbsp 
	Serafin was a child prodigy on the violin, and is said to have played for 
	Verdi.&nbsp; Serafin studied violin at the Milan Conservatory.&nbsp; He played in the La Scala 
	orchestra under Toscanini, beginning in about 1898.&nbsp; Serafin made 
	his conducting debut at Ferrara, Italy in 1898.&nbsp; In the early 
	1900s, Serafin also began conducting at La Scala.&nbsp; His 
	abilities were such that when Toscanini departed for the Metropolitan 
	Opera in 1908, Serafin increased his conducting, and was named Music 
	Director, beginning in the 1909-1910 season.&nbsp; Serafin introduced 
	new works, such as conducting the Italian premiere of Strauss's 
	Der Rosenkavalier <sup>41</sup>.&nbsp; Serafin 
	continued in this position until 1918 except 
	when La Scala was closed 1914-1917 because of World War 1.&nbsp; La Scala was then 
	again closed 1918-1920.&nbsp; In 1924, Serafin joined the conducting staff at the MET 
	in the Italian repertoire for ten seasons until the end of 1933-1934.&nbsp; In 1926, 
	Serafin went to Rome to take over the Teatro Reale dell'Opera, which he resuscitated 
	during the next decade, 1934-1943.&nbsp; Serafin is said to be one of the first who 
	realized the great talent of Maria Callas, and cultivated it.&nbsp; Callas said 
	that it was Serafin, who conducted her Italian debut, who guided her to 
	become a prima donna <sup>41</sup>.&nbsp; With Maria Callas, Serafin did much to 
	create interest in the 'bel canto', repertoire, substantially forgotten in opera 
	houses by the mid-Twentieth century.&nbsp; Most singers were happy under 
	Serafin's direction, since he was 
	typically positive, supportive, and attentive to their musical styles.&nbsp; Tullio 
	Serafin died in Rome in February 2, 1968, just short of his 
	ninetieth birthday.

	during the 'off' season, which was the prime opera season for the 
	Teatro Colón.&nbsp; Panizza's conducting style was vigorous and propulsive.&nbsp; 
	Panizza died in Milan, Italy November 27, 1967.

	Erich Leinsdorf was born Erich J. Landauer in Vienna, Austria on 
	February 4, 1912. Leinsdorf studied piano, cello and conducting at 
	the Universität Mozarteum Salzburg, followed by the University of 
	Vienna and the Vienna Conservatory. At the Salzburg Festival, 
	1934-1938, Leinsdorf was conducting assistant first to Bruno Walter 
	and then Arturo Toscanini. Leinsdorf's ability to sight read scores 
	at the piano, his memory, and his Italian language skills were advantages 
	at Salzburg, and Toscanini became something of a mentor to Leinsdorf.&nbsp; 
	During these years, Leinsdorf also conducted opera Italy, in Bologna, 
	Trieste, Florence, and San Remo.&nbsp; In 1938, Leinsdorf left Vienna 
	and Europe because of the rise of the Nazi influence and went to 
	New York.&nbsp; At the recommendation of Lotte 
	Lehmann to Artur Bodanzky <sup>55</sup>, Leinsdorf joined the Metropolitan 
	Opera in the 1938-1939 season. Beginning in the 1939-1940 season, 
	following the death or Artur Bodanzky, Erich Leinsdorf was named 
	principal MET conductor of the German repertory, which gave Leinsdorf's 
	career an immediate boost during 1939-1942.&nbsp; Leinsdorf found the 
	Metropolitan Opera progressively more frustrating, with the few 
	rehearsals and the negative atmosphere of opera house politics.&nbsp; 
	In 1942 in a controversial selection process in which candidates 
	George Szell and Vladimir Golschmann were turned down <sup>54</sup>, 
	Erich Leinsdorf was named Music Director of the Cleveland Orchestra. 
	Leinsdorf happily departed from the MET, but he was unlucky at Cleveland.
	&nbsp; First, in the 1942-1943 season, with the US entering World War 2, 
	Cleveland lost 22 musicians, whom Leinsdorf needed to replace.&nbsp; 
	One of Leinsdorf's hires was George Goslee, Principal bassoon, who remained 
	with the orchestra for 44 seasons.&nbsp; Then, Leinsdorf himself was drafted 
	into the U.S. Army 1943-1945, and so was not able to make his mark in 
	Cleveland.&nbsp; Leinsdorf received his Army discharge in September, 1944.&nbsp; 
	Meanwhile, the 1944-1945 Cleveland Orchestra season had already been 
	programmed with guest conductors including George Szell who had very 
	successful series of November 1944 concerts.&nbsp; The 1945-1946 Cleveland 
	season became a horserace between Leinsdorf, Szell, and Vladimir Golschmann 
	as to who would become permanent Music Director.&nbsp; Szell made a strong 
	impression on Cleveland that season, and Erich Leinsdorf gradually 
	lost our to Szell.&nbsp; This may have seemed the destiny of George Szell, 
	who continued with 24 seasons of greatness with the Cleveland 
	Orchestra.&nbsp; Leinsdorf then went on to the Rochester Philharmonic, where 
	he was Music Director for eight seasons, 1947-1955.&nbsp; Then, after a 
	brief period at the New York City Opera, Leinsdorf returned as a leading 
	conductor of the Metropolitan Opera during 1957-1962.&nbsp;

	Erich Leinsdorf was appointed Music Director of the Boston Symphony in the 
	1962-1963 season.&nbsp; During his seven seasons with the BSO until 1969, 
	Leinsdorf and the Boston Symphony made many recordings for RCA Victor, 
	including an excellent series of Prokofiev symphonies and concerti.&nbsp; 
	1978-1980, Erich Leinsdorf was conductor of the Berlin Radio Orchestra.
	&nbsp; After the departure of Lorin 
	Maazel from his stormy Cleveland tenure in 1982, Erich Leinsdorf returned to 
	Cleveland frequently to provide continuity prior to the arrival of Christoph 
	von Dohnányi in the 1984-1985 season.&nbsp; Erich Leinsdorf 
	in his last years divided his residence among Sarasota, Florida, 
	Zurich, Switzerland, and New York.&nbsp; Erich Leinsdorf died in a Zurich 
	hospital, suffering from cancer on September 11, 1993.&nbsp; His musical 
	erudition and generous personality gained respect, and during his most 
	inspired performances, particularly in the opera house, he was often 
	the equal of any of his contemporaries.

	George Szell rehearsing in his first season with the Cleveland Orchestra 1947
	</font>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:13px">
	George Szell was born in Budapest, Hungary on June 7, 1897.&nbsp; 
	Before he was six, his family had moved to Vienna, and George Szell 
	considered himself Viennese in origin.&nbsp; He showed early musical 
	talent and was taken as a piano student by Richard Robert (1861-1924), 
	who also taught Rudolf Serkin and Clara Haskill, and who had been 
	a friend of Brahms.&nbsp; Georg Szell (as he was then) toured a number 
	of European cities in 1909 as a piano prodigy.&nbsp; By his mid-teens, 
	Szell said later that he had determined to become a conductor.&nbsp; 
	His first conducting opportunity came, it seems in a Bavarian spa, 
	Bad Kissingen in either 1913 or 1914 according to different sources.&nbsp;
	He had been vacationing there, where members of the Vienna Symphony were 
	also performing.&nbsp; The Vienna Symphony conductor was injured, and 
	Szell substituted, with success.&nbsp; In 1915, he conducted the 
	Blüthner Orchestra, sponsored by the piano company, in Berlin.&nbsp; 
	Also in 1915, at age 18, Szell gained appointment as one of the 
	conductors at the Berlin Royal Opera 
	or &quot;Königliche Kapelle&quot;, after 1919 named &quot;Staatsoper 
	Berlin&quot;.&nbsp; There, Richard Strauss became something of 
	a mentor to Szell, whom he saw had great talents, including in the 
	performance of Strauss's own compositions.&nbsp; A famous story, often 
	retold, from about this time was of the 1917 acoustic recording of 
	Strauss's <i>Don Juan</i>, opus 20.&nbsp; The recording with the 
	Königliche Kapelle orchestra was to be rehearsed by Szell, so that 
	Strauss could sleep later.&nbsp; After the rehearsal, with Strauss 
	still not arriving, the Gramophon engineers instructed Szell to continue 
	to conduct the recording.&nbsp; After Szell had recorded two of the four 
	78 RPM sides of about 4 minutes each, Strauss who had arrived conducted 
	the other two sides.&nbsp; This recording, issued on Gramophon disks 
	69525, 69526, 65856, and 65857 <sup>74</sup> shows Szell more fiery 
	and rapid, and Strauss more lyrical.&nbsp; In later years, Szell said 
	that he learned much about music and conducting from Strauss, although 
	he also told amusing stories about Strauss's occasional lack of involvement 
	with his conducting if other things were on Strauss's mind.&nbsp; 
	</p>&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:13px">
	After the Berlin Royal Opera, in 1917, Szell had the opportunity to 
	become conductor of the Municipal Theatre, Strasbourg on the recommendation 
	of Otto Klemperer, whom he succeeded.&nbsp; In 1918, Szell went to 
	the German Opera (Neues deutsches Theater) in Prague.&nbsp; This experience 
	was followed in about 1921-1924 by conducting appointments of the Darmstadt 
	Theater and of the Deutsche Oper - Düsseldorf.&nbsp; In 1924, 
	Georg Szell returned to the renamed Berlin State Opera - Staatsoper Berlin 
	as a conductor under Erich Kleiber.&nbsp; In 1929, Georg Szell returned 
	to Prague now as Music Director of the German Opera and of the 
	Philharmonic.&nbsp; The next season 1930-1931 saw his US premier as a 
	guest conductor of the St. Louis Symphony in 1930, where he returned 
	in 1931.&nbsp; Szell was considered a candidate for the St. Louis 
	Symphony music directorship, vacant since the 1927 departure of Rudolph 
	Ganz to the Chicago Musical College.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Szell continued 
	his posts in Prague until 1937, when he accepted two concurrent orchestra 
	responsibilities: the Residente Orchestra in the Hague - Netherlands and the 
	Scottish Orchestra (later the Scottish National Orchestra) in Glasgow.&nbsp; 
	In 1938 and 1939, George Szell performed extensively in Australia with the 
	Australian Broadcasting Company.&nbsp; Returning from Australia in 1939, 
	with war beginning in Europe, George Szell stayed in New York City, 
	where he initially taught at the Mannes School of Music.&nbsp; In the 
	summers of 1939 and 1940, Szell was a conductor at the Hollywood Bowl.&nbsp; 
	An important break for Szell was Toscanini's invitation conduct the 
	NBC Symphony in 1941.&nbsp; Toscanini is said to have been impressed 
	previously when he guest-conducted Szell's Residente Orchestra and found 
	it much improved.&nbsp; Szell was hired for the German repertoire at the 
	Metropolitan Opera in the 1942-1943 season, succeeding Erich Leinsdorf.&nbsp; 
	George Szell continued at the Metropolitan Opera for four seasons 1942-1946.
	&nbsp; After Arthur Rodzinski accepted the Music Director position of the 
	New York Philharmonic in December, 1942, George Szell was a candidate, along 
	with Erich Leinsdorf and Vladimir Golschmann to become Music Director of the 
	Cleveland Orchestra.&nbsp; <a href="#Erich Leinsdorf">
	<font color="#000080"><i><u>
	As described above
	</u></i></font></a>, Erich Leinsdorf was selected for Cleveland, 
	but within a year, Leinsdorf entered the US Army, so making little impression 
	in Cleveland.&nbsp; In the 1944-1945 season, when Leinsdorf was available to 
	conduct, the Cleveland Orchestra season had already been programmed with 
	guest conductors including George Szell.&nbsp; The 1945-1946 Cleveland 
	season became a horserace between Leinsdorf, Szell, and Vladimir Golschmann 
	as to who would become permanent conductor.&nbsp; George Szell gradually 
	emerged during that season as the favorite, and was appointed Music Director 
	beginning with the 1946-1947 season.&nbsp; This began one of the legendary 
	Conductor - Orchestra partnerships of the twentieth century.&nbsp;

	Fritz Busch began piano study at age five, and also 
	began studying the instruments of the orchestra early  as part of his free tuition 
	<sup>86</sup>.&nbsp; At Cologne, he studied 
	piano under Karl Boettcher and conducting under Fritz Steinbach (1855-1916).&nbsp; 
	In 1909, still only 19, he had his first conducting experience at the Deutsches 
	Theater in Riga, Latvia (Bruno Walter also had early conducting experience 
	there).&nbsp; This was followed by two small regional orchestras in central 
	Germany: Bad Pyrmont and Gotha.&nbsp; 
	In 1912, he moved to the larger city of Aachen in the extreme west of Germany.&nbsp; 
	Following his service in World War 1 (he was wounded), an opportunity in 1918 for 
	Busch to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic in music of Reger led Fritz 
	Busch to be appointed conductor in Stuttgart 1918-1922.&nbsp; In 1922, Busch moved to 
	the post he was early associated with, as Music Director of the Semper Opera in 
	Dresden, Germany.&nbsp; Fritz Busch developed the Semper Opera into one of the 
	leading opera houses of Europe.&nbsp; He led the premieres of several Richard 
	Strauss operas: Intermezzo (1924) and Die Ägyptische Helena - The Egyptian Helen 
	(1928).&nbsp; Busch prepared the premiere of Strauss' Arabella in 1933.&nbsp; However, with 
	the accession of the Nazi government, Busch, although not Jewish, was an early target 
	because of his expressed political disagreement with 'National Socialism'.&nbsp; 
	Fritz Busch was expelled from the Semper Opera, and Clemens Krauss conducted the 
	premiere <sup>85</sup>.&nbsp; At this time, Busch was invited to conduct at the Colon 
	Theater in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he went in 1933, leaving Germany.&nbsp; 
	Fritz Busch was Music Director of the Glyndebourne Music Festival 1934-1951.&nbsp; 
	During this same period, Fritz Busch was principal guest conductor of the Danish National 
	Symphony Orchestra in Copenhagen 1934-1951.&nbsp; He also guest conducted many leading 
	orchestras in the 1930s and 1940s, including the NBC 
	Symphony, the Chicago Symphony, the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, 
	and.&nbsp; Fritz Busch made his Metropolitan Opera debut November 26, 1945 with Wagner's 
	Lohengrin <sup>89</sup>.&nbsp; 1945-1949, Busch was one of the principal conductors of 
	the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, not only in German, but in the Italian repertoire.&nbsp; 
	In early 1951, Fritz Busch accepted the direction of the Vienna 
	Staatsoper.&nbsp; In the Summer of 1951, Fritz Busch conducted at the Glyndebourne, and 
	took Glyndebourne to the Edinburgh Festival.&nbsp; Busch had progressive heart disease 
	during the previous five years, and on July 20, 1951 he collapsed during a performance 
	of Don Giovanni <sup>88</sup>.&nbsp; Although ill, was able to complete the season 
	with at Glyndebourne and Edinburgh.&nbsp; He was to have taken the Glyndebourne 
	company on a U.S. tour in 1952.&nbsp; However, Fritz Busch died of a heart attack in 
	a London hotel on September 14, 1951 <sup>87</sup>.&nbsp; So, Fritz Busch's death at 
	age only 61 prevented him from taking up either the Vienna Staatsoper position or 
	the Glyndebourne U.S. tour.&nbsp; Fritz Busch certainly had a successful career in 
	North and South America, and in England and Denmark.&nbsp; However, after Dresden, 
	Busch never benefited from the public acclaim given to the very most popular conductors 
	of his generation.&nbsp; Yet, his surviving recordings demonstrate he was of that level.

	Fritz Reiner was born in Budapest, Hungary on December 19, 1888.&nbsp; 
	Reiner in Budapest intended to study law, at the urging of his father, 
	but in 1899, he entered the Franz Liszt Academy, where he studied piano (including 
	with Bela Bartok) and composition (Leo Weiner).&nbsp; Reiner had his initial experiences 
	as a répétiteur at the German Comic Opera at Budapest in 1908.&nbsp; In 
	1910-1911, Reiner was conductor at the German Opera House in Ljubljana 
	(now in Slovenia) under Vaclav Talich (1883-1961).&nbsp; In 1914, Reiner 
	moved to Dresden, conducting at the Saxon Court Oper, where 
	he came into extended contact with Richard Strauss.&nbsp; In Dresden, 
	Reiner conducted the first performance of Strauss's 'Die Frau ohne 
	Schatten', immediately following its Vienna premieres in 1919.&nbsp; Reiner 
	left Dresden in 1921 and then emigrated to the U.S. in 1922 to become 
	conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony, following his predecessors 
	Frank Van der Stucken (1895-1907), Leopold Stokowski (1909-1912), and 
	Eugène Ysaÿe (1918-1922).&nbsp; Fritz Reiner stayed in Cincinnati for eleven 
	seasons, from 1922-1933.&nbsp; By the 1925-1926 season, only 25 of the 
	original 92 musicians of the orchestra when Reiner arrived in 1922 
	were still with the Cincinnati Symphony.&nbsp; Reiner became a U.S. citizen in 
	1928.&nbsp; Beginning in 1931, Reiner was in charge of the conducting program at the 
	Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, where he continued until 1938.&nbsp; In 
	the 1938-1939 season, Reiner became Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony, 
	which he reorganized and improved, while firing dozens of musicians each 
	season.&nbsp; Reiner remained at Pittsburgh until the end of the 1947-1948 
	season, where he made a number of famous recordings for Columbia records.&nbsp; 
	During this period, he also made stylish recordings of baroque music including 
	the Bach Brandenburg Concerti with New York session musicians which demonstrated 
	his mastery, uncommon for the period, of baroque playing.&nbsp; In 
	both Pittsburgh and Chicago, Reiner also recorded a number of works 
	of Bela Bartok, and he was instrumental in convincing Serge Koussevitzky 
	to commission in 1943 Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra.&nbsp; 1949-1953 and 
	as guest conductor later, Fritz Reiner was the principal among 
	a number of staff conductors at the MET, during the early regime of Rudolf 
	Bing, who became General Manager in 1950.&nbsp; While at the MET, Reiner conducted 
	a number of famous productions, including in 1949, the Strauss Salome with soprano 
	Ljuba Welitsch as Salome, and the U.S. premiere of Stravinsky's 'The Rake's Progress' 
	in 1951.&nbsp; In 1953, Reiner was named Music Director of the Chicago Symphony, a 
	post he maintained for nine seasons until the end of the 1961-1962 season.&nbsp; 
	Reiner then became Musical Advisor in Chicago for the 1962-1963 season.&nbsp;  Even 
	though Georg Solti famously claimed that prior to his arrival in Chicago in 1969, 
	the Chicago Symphony was a 'provincial orchestra', in fact, through good selection 
	of musicians, demanding standards and in part through his ruthless elimination 
	of any musician who displeased him, Reiner build 
	one of the great orchestras of the world in Chicago.&nbsp; Although 
	many conductors have had the reputation of being a martinet, Fritz Reiner does 
	seem to have had a sadistic streak in his conduct, and was famous for his hounding 
	of the the musicians of weakest character in his orchestras, and playing 
	'mind games' to manipulate his players.&nbsp; However, strong characters, 
	such as Ray Still (oboe) or Donald Peck (flute) generally did not 
	have problems with Reiner.&nbsp; In Chicago, Reiner also produced 
	many great recordings, too numerous to mention individually.&nbsp; These recordings 
	for Victor were also sonically at the leading edge of their time, and are still 
	highly regarded both for inspired performances, and rich, transparent sound.&nbsp; 
	In spite of being, perhaps a mean and unlovable as a person, Fritz Reiner as a conductor 
	was one of the greats of the Twentieth Century, with a command of musical idioms from 
	Bach, through Mozart, to the Romantics and Strauss, up to the music by his teacher, 
	Bartok.&nbsp; Perhaps the only surprising gap is that he seems not to have been one 
	of the great interpreters of Beethoven.&nbsp; Following a major heart 
	attack in October 7, 1960, Reiner did not conduct the Chicago Symphony 
	until late March, 1961 <sup>31</sup>.&nbsp; After the heart attack, Reiner 
	continued to conduct, although more cautiously, in Chicago, and preparing 
	a new MET production of Die Götterdämmerung.&nbsp; Finally, after April, 
	1963, Reiner withdrew to his long-time home, Rambleside in Connecticut.&nbsp; 
	Fritz Reiner died in New York City November 15, 1963.

	Rafael Kubelik was born June 29, 1914  in Bychory, a Czech village about 50 km 
	east of Prague.&nbsp; Rafael was the sixth of 8 musical children of the famous 
	Bohemian violinist Jan Kubelik (1880-1940) and his wife Countess Marianne 
	Czáky-Szell.&nbsp; Rafael initially studied violin with his father, and also 
	piano with his uncle Frantisek Kubelik, with whom Rafael played the symphonic 
	classics four hands.&nbsp; Rafael Kubelik entered the Prague Conservatory in 
	1928, where he studied violin, piano, composition, and conducting, where he 
	graduated with his diploma in 1933.&nbsp; In 1935 and 1936, Rafael Kubelik 
	toured with his father, first in Europe and in 1936 in the US and Canada, 
	Jan playing the violin, and Rafael accompanying on piano, or conducting

	In 1936, Kubelik was appointed by Vaclav Talich to 
	Assistant Conductor of the Czech Philharmonic.&nbsp; In 1937, when Talich 
	was unable to take the Czech Philharmonic on a UK tour, Kubelik substituted 
	for him<sup>112</sup>.&nbsp; Kubelik was Director of the Brno Opera House 
	from 1939-1941, and was chief conductor of the Czech Philharmonic 
	1942-1948.&nbsp; In 1948, with the rise of a Communist authoritarian 
	regime, Kubelik left Czechoslovakia, vowing not to return until the end 
	of authoritarian rule.&nbsp; Kubelik settled first in England, where he 
	conducted, including at Glyndebourne.&nbsp; Rafael Kubelik was offered 
	conducting positions in the UK, including as a successor to Sir Adrian 
	Boult at the BBC Orchestra, but opted instead for the Chicago 
	Symphony.&nbsp; Kubelik was Music Director of the Chicago Symphony 
	for three seasons 1950-1953.&nbsp; His Music Directorship in Chicago 
	started badly when he attempted to replace replacing 22 of musicians 
	during the first season, which met vigorous opposition.&nbsp; Also, 
	during his Chicago term, Chicago Tribune music critic Claudia Cassidy 
	who was an unrelenting critic of Kubelik <sup>109</sup>, among other 
	reasons it is said because of too heavy a diet of contemporary music.&nbsp; 
	Kubelik then returned to the UK, where he conducted both symphony and 
	opera.&nbsp; On October 6, 1954, Kubelik was named Music Director of 
	Covent Garden Opera, serving 1955-1958. <sup>108</sup>. However, Kubelik's 
	time at the Covent Garden Opera was also stormy, with Sir Thomas Beecham, 
	among others, criticizing having a foreign Music Director of Covent 
	Garden.&nbsp; Although Kubelik remained, he did not renew his contract 
	in 1958.&nbsp; Although Kubelik had refused to conduct in Germany 
	following World War 2, he accepted to become Music Director of the 
	Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1961.&nbsp; Kubelik remained in 
	Munich 1961-1980 producing also numerous recordings.&nbsp; Kubelik took 
	Swiss citizenship in 1967 <sup>110</sup> In late 1971, Goran Gentele, 
	the new General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera asked Kubelík to 
	become Music Director, a newly created position, which even Arturo 
	Toscanini did not hold.&nbsp; Kubelik and Gentele had a good working 
	relationship, and Kubelík accepted, being named Music Director of the 
	Metropolitan Opera in 1972 <sup>111</sup>. However, Gentele died in an 
	automobile accident in Italy on July 18, 1972, which undermined Kubelík's 
	working conditions at the MET.&nbsp; Kubelik made his Metropolitan Opera 
	debut in October, 1973 with <i>Les Troyens</i>.&nbsp; However, he suffered 
	regular criticism as spenting too much time in Europe, and of being a 
	weak administrator.&nbsp; Tensions at the MET continued, and in February 
	1974, five months after his debut, he resigned.&nbsp; James Levine 
	subsequently succeeded Kubelik <sup>110</sup>.&nbsp; In later years, 
	Kubelik's health deteriorated, due to heart disease and arthritis, 
	which forced his retirement in 1985 <sup>112</sup>.&nbsp; However, 
	Rafael Kubelik did conduct on further occassions: he returned to 
	Czechoslovakia in 1990 to conduct &quot;Ma Vlast&quot; at the opening 
	of the first Prague Spring Festival after the Vaclav Havel &quot;Velvet 
	Revolution&quot;. He also returned to Chicago on several occasions, 
	the last being on October 18, 1991, the commemorative Centennial concert 
	of the CSO, recreating the first Theodore Thomas concert of October 16, 
	1891.&nbsp; Kubelik conducted the Dvorak <i>Hussika Overture</i> at that 
	Centennial celebration.&nbsp; Rafael Kubelik died near Lucerne, Switzerland 
	on August 11, 1996.

	James Levine&nbsp;was born June 23, 1943 in that musical city of 
	Cincinnati, Ohio.&nbsp; His father was a violinist 
	who lead a dance band, and his mother had 
	studied with Martha Graham.&nbsp; Levine began piano 
	study at age 4 <sup>51</sup>, and was something of a prodigy.&nbsp; At age 
	10, he played the Mendelssohn Second Piano Concerto at a Cincinnati 
	Symphony youth concert.&nbsp; Also at age 10, Levine began study 
	with Walter Levin, first violin of the LaSalle Quartet, then 
	quartet-in-residence in Cincinnati. (Levin apparently initially said 
	'the ten-year-old has not been born that I would teach'.)&nbsp; 
	In the summer of 1956, at age 13, Levine studied at 
	Rudolf Serkin's Marlboro Music School in Vermont.&nbsp; 
	The next summer, in 1957, Levine attended the Aspen Music School in 
	Colorado, where he studied with with pianist Rosina Lhévinne 
	(1880-1976), even though Levine had already settled on conducting 
	as a career.&nbsp; His relationship with Rosina Lhévinne continued 
	over the next decades.&nbsp; In 1961, Levine entered the Juilliard 
	School, where he studied conducting with Jean Morel (1903-1975).&nbsp; 
	James Levine graduated from Juilliard in 1964, just before his 
	twenty-first birthday.&nbsp; In later years, James Levine 
	said that the three most influential persons on his musical 
	development were Walter Levin, Rosina Lhévinne, and Jean Morel.&nbsp; 
	Levine thought that Jean Morel was perhaps not one of the great conductors, 
	but a very good teacher of preparation and conducting technique 
	<sup>51</sup>.&nbsp; In 1964-1965 season, Levine studied with George Szell 
	and the Cleveland Orchestra, where he became assistant conductor to 
	Szell 1965-1970.&nbsp; In 1971, Levine succeeded Seiji Ozawa as Music 
	Director of Chicago's Ravinia Festival.&nbsp; From 1971-1994, for 
	twenty-three seasons, James Levine was Music Director of the Ravinia 
	Festival each summer, being succeeded in turn by Christoph Eschenbach.&nbsp; 
	During this period, 1974-1978, Levine was also Music Director of the 
	Cincinnati May Festival in his home town.&nbsp; Levine made his Metropolitan 
	Opera debut in the summer of 1971, with an acclaimed performance of Tosca, 
	followed by return engagements.&nbsp; Then, in the 1973-1974 season, 
	Levine was appointed Principal Conductor of the Metropolitan Opera.&nbsp; 
	Levine was further offered the Music Director position of the Metropolitan 
	Opera by Schuyler Chapin, then General Manager, but with the stipulation that 
	Chapin would reserve artistic decisions, as Sir Rudolf Bing had done 
	<sup>51</sup>.&nbsp; James Levine is said to have considered such an 
	arrangement unworkable.&nbsp; The situation evolved, including the 
	departure of Chapin.&nbsp; Then, for the 1976-1977 season, James Levine 
	was appointed Music Director of the Metropolitan Opera, a position Levine 
	still holds.&nbsp; In this position, it can be said that Levine has more 
	total authority at the Metropolitan Opera than even Arturo Toscanini did 
	with Gatti-Casazza from 1908-1915.&nbsp; </p>

	At the MET, Levine has every year improved the working conditions and the 
	quality of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.&nbsp; Levine gradually added 
	co-Principals in each of the orchestra sections, so as to reduce the 
	heavy weekly work load of the Principal musicians.&nbsp; This, and the 
	improvement of salaries and conditions allowed the Metropolitan Opera 
	Orchestra to hire the best musicians, and to improve overall performance 
	quality.&nbsp; With the virtuoso level of his orchestra, Levine also began 
	a regular series of successful concert programs by the Metropolitan Opera 
	Orchestra at Carnegie Hall.&nbsp; This was not the first time the Metropolitan 
	Opera Orchestra had given purely orchestral concerts, but it was judged by 
	critics to have achieved a new level of organization and quality in this 
	orchestral series.&nbsp; James Levine first conducted the Boston Symphony 
	in 1972.&nbsp; James Levine became the fourteenth Music Director of the 
	Boston Symphony in the 2004-2005 season.&nbsp; Since his appointment in Boston, 
	Levine has suffer health problems, including surgery in 2008 and 2009.&nbsp; 
	Most serious was lengthy spinal surgery in April, 2010.&nbsp; However, James 
	Levine made a triumphant return to open the 2010-2011 Boston Symphony season 
	on October 2, 2010 <sup>101</sup>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it was not to last, 
	and the spinal problems continued, forcing James Levine to resign as 
	Music Director of the Boston Symphony in March, 2011.

	his retirement fifty years later.&nbsp; In 1936, he states, the 
	orchestra musicians were contracted for 8 performances per week, 7 
	evening operas and one Saturday matinee <sup>3</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;By 
	1961, the musicians played 7 performances per week <sup>11</sup>, 
	compared with the typical American orchestra schedule of 3 
	performances per week, and of concerts typically shorter than the 
	length of most operas.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="4"></p>

	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
	<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1961, 
	the musicians of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra sought to 
	negotiate a new contract providing them with less performances, and 
	procedures to reduce the ability of the Metropolitan Opera 
	management (Rudolf Bing and the conductors) to fire or demote 
	orchestra musicians.&nbsp; The orchestra failed to achieve its 
	objectives, which set up the confrontation in 1966 prior to the 
	opening of the new Metropolitan Opera house in Lincoln Center.

	<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">in 1964, 
	the musicians allowed their contract to be extended, and worked for a year without a contract 
	leading up to the opening of the new opera house in the Autumn of 
	1966.&nbsp; They believed, correctly, that this lack of a 
	contract would allow the musicians 
	to bargain powerfully for the concessions they sought, but had failed to 
	win in 1961.&nbsp; The Orchestra prevailed 
	on Sir Rudolf Bing, General Manager from 1950 to 1972 by threatening to 
	delay the opening of the new Opera House at Lincoln 
	Center.&nbsp; The principal issue was that of reducing the weekly performance load.&nbsp; 
	They gained a reduction to 6.5 performance per week (a night off every 
	second week), and further progressive reductions to 5 performances a week by 1970
	<sup>4</sup>.&nbsp; Also, they gained, for the first time, group medical

	<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As he gained administrative 
	authority, James Levine, starting in 1980 
	progressively reduced the workload and consequently was able to attract the 
	number of quality of musicians necessary to add 'second' or 'alternate' musicians 
	for the first chairs of each of 
	the instrumental sections, including the strings.&nbsp; For many 
	years, and at least since World War 1, the woodwinds and brass had 
	employed alternates, since the demands of these instruments would 
	not permit them to play night after night without respite, without 
	the risk of a breakdown. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="4"></p>

	gradually increased from 12 weeks in the 1930s 16 weeks 1937-1945
	<sup>13</sup> and to 26 weeks by 1952.&nbsp; 
	This would also increase in those years with extended national 
	tours, such as 1948 and 1949, when ten addition weeks of touring was 
	added <sup>5</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the 1980s, the Metropolitan Opera 
	Orchestra's season was for the full year.&nbsp; For the first time, 
	the MET Orchestra musicians had year-around employment with a workload 
	similar to their Symphony Orchestra colleagues, and with medical 
	insurance.&nbsp; The improvements in playing standards became gradually 
	apparent under Levine.

	Composition of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra</u></b>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
	&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
	From its inception until the end of World War 1, the Metropolitan 
	Opera Orchestra was predominantly composed of German trained 
	musicians.&nbsp;  This was also the case in many of the U.S. symphony 
	orchestras, including New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.&nbsp; 
	Anne Mischakoff Heiles in her excellent book 
	<i><u>America's Concertmasters</u></i> 
	writes, quoting also from David Mann: '...Soon he [Mann] was asked to 
	substitute at the Metropolitan Opera and at two Philharmonic concerts 
	led by Anton Seidl. Rehearsals were conducted in German, and American 
	musicians were a rarity - only three of the Philharmonic's hundred 
	players!...' <sup>34</sup>.&nbsp;
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
	&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
	Joseph Horowitz in his book 
	Classical music in America writes: '...A comparison of MET rosters 
	for 1914-1915 and 1934-1935 (as found in the Metropolitan Opera 
	Archives) shows that the earlier orchestra was by far more German 
	than Italian. In 1934-1935, however, no fewer than fifty-three of 
	eighty-five musicians on the permanent roster had incontestably 
	Italian names...' <sup>33</sup>.&nbsp;  
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
	&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
	So, the Metropolitan 
	Opera Orchestra, much like most other leading U.S. orchestras 
	following World War 1 was made up of progressively more and more  
	musicians of Italian and French as well as Russian 
	training.&nbsp; Similarly, 
	following World War 2, and until today, these orchestras have 
	included more and more American-trained musicians, coming out 
	of the dozens of leading U.S. conservatories.&nbsp; The fact 
	of two massive World Wars devastated Europe in the first half 
	of the Twentieth Century, and the rapid growth of U.S. conservatories 
	such as the Curtis Institute, the Juilliard, Peabody, New England 
	Conservatory, the music department of Indiana University, and 
	many others all contributed to these changes.  
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
	&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
	These changes have continued to evolve until 
	today, most U.S. orchestras, including the MET, are 
	made up primarily of American-trained musicians, with a flavoring of 
	European and increasingly Asian and Latin American trained musicians.

	The Concertmaster title:&nbsp; Given the heavy performance 
	load of an opera orchestra such as the Metropolitan, 
	the orchestra has usually had 'assistant' or 
	'associate' Concertmasters to share 
	the extensive performance workload.&nbsp; As a result 
	of James Levine's policies regarding the Orchestra, starting in 
	1980, the musician's workload was reduced to 4 
	days a week, raising standards and also requiring 
	the hiring of many added musicians.&nbsp; This also 
	resulted in the new position of an additional 
	Concertmaster.&nbsp;
	Guy Lumia was the first of these added 
	Concertmasters in 1984, alternating with Raymond 
	Gniewek (who was Concertmaster for 43 years, 
	1957-2000).

	Nahan Franko was born in New Orleans 
	July 23, 1861 into a large musical family (11 children).&nbsp; 
	His family lost all during the Civil War, the father, Hamman 
	Franko being an ardent Confederate supporter.&nbsp; 
	Hamman Franco and his wife Helene Bergman Franko were German Jews 
	who emigrated to Texas.&nbsp; The original family name for Hamman 
	Franco, a jeweler, was Hollander, a leading German Jewish family 
	which also produced a number of musicians.&nbsp; In 1864, following 
	the occupation of New Orleans by Union forces, and Hamman's finances 
	being threatened, the Franko family relocated to Germany,&nbsp; 
	Nahan Franko and his brother 
	Sam Franko (1857-1937) studied with Heinrich Karl Hermann de Ahna 
	(1835-1892) in Berlin - probably at the Berlin Akademische Hochschule 
	für Musik where de Ahna taught under Joseph Joachim (1831-1907) 
	direction.&nbsp; Nahan's sister, Jeanne, was a pianist.&nbsp; 
	The Franko family returned to New York in 1869. Later, both 
	Nahan and Sam Franko returned to Berlin for further study 
	with Joachim and August Wilhelmj (1845-1908). Nahan Frank 
	began as Concertmaster of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, according 
	to Heiles <sup>7</sup> probably in 1883.&nbsp; He of course 
	did not play at the MET when it was closed 1897 - 1898.&nbsp; Also, he did 
	not play there in the 1904 - 1905 season after a disagreement with 
	the conductor of the German repertoire Alfred Hertz 
	(Hertz was later the conductor of the San Francisco Symphony).&nbsp; 
	As was the practice of that era when musicians sought 
	constant work, Nahan Franko also seems to have at least 
	sometimes acted as Concertmaster of the New York Symphony 
	during this MET period.&nbsp; Franko conducted more than 100 
	performances of the Metropolitan Opera in the first decade 
	of the 1900s, including the series of Sunday evening 
	orchestral concerts.&nbsp; During the 1910s and 1920s, Nahan 
	Franko also lead the 'Franko Orchestra' at concerts and 
	social occasions. Nahan Franko died in Amityville, New York 
	on June 7, 1930 subsequent to a stroke.

	at the Cincinnati May Festival in 1878, when Bendix was only 12 <sup>6</sup>.&nbsp; 
	In 1880, he became Concertmaster of the Cincinnati Orchestra under the conductor 
	Maratsek (a musician I have not been able to identify) <sup>6</sup>. 
	In about 1883-1884, Bendix was Concertmaster of the

	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="4">
	In about 1886-1887, Max Bendix toured as Concertmaster with the 
	Theodore Thomas Orchestra <sup>6</sup>, at least his second 
	professional work with Theodore Thomas. Bendix spent the year 1889 
	studying in Europe, and in 1890 again was Concertmaster of the 
	Thomas orchestra at the Cincinnati May Festive.&nbsp; Then, when in 
	the Autumn of 1891 Theodore Thomas created the first season of the 
	Chicago Symphony Orchestra (then called the &quot;Chicago Orchestra&quot;),
	&nbsp; Thomas again selected Max Bendix as his Concertmaster.&nbsp; In 
	1893, Chicago organized the World's Columbian Exposition, 
	celebrating the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America.&nbsp; 
	According to Russell, Theodore Thomas did not want to become Music 
	Director of the Exposition, given his bad experiences in 
	Philadelphia in 1876, but reluctantly accepted <sup>7</sup>.&nbsp; 
	The Thomas misgivings proved founded, and after months of 
	internecine politics at the Exposition, Thomas finally resigned in 
	August, 1893 <sup>7</sup>.&nbsp; It seems that the Chicago Orchestra 
	did continue to perform at the Exposition, but under the leadership 
	of Max Bendix, which Theodore Thomas likely resented. In any case, 
	Max Bendix had the reputation of a difficult and sensitive artist, 
	and there was a series of confrontations between the two men during 
	Bendix's tenure at the Chicago Orchestra.&nbsp; Max Bendix did not return to the 
	Chicago orchestra in the 1896-1897 season.&nbsp; The New York Times 
	on September 18, 1896, in an article apparently based on the Bendix 
	view, reported &quot;...the breach between the old 
	friends [Theodore Thomas and Max Bendix], which began when Bendix 
	took charge of the orchestra when Thomas left it in a huff, during 
	the World's Fair, has gradually widened, and this year, Bendix was 
	not given a renewal of his contract. Arthur Mees of New York will be 
	assistant conductor in his place, and will be billed as such - an 
	honor Mr. Thomas never accorded to Bendix.&quot;&nbsp; In 1897-1898, 
	Max Bendix made a U.S. transcontinental tour with Eugène Ysaÿe 
	(1858-1931), violin, Henri Marteau (1874-1934), violin, Jean Gerardy 
	(1877-1929), cello, Aimé Lachaume (1877-1944), piano.&nbsp;

	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="4">
	The turbulent career of Bendix also included extensive conducting.&nbsp; 
	He conducted the St. Louis World's Fair orchestra in 1904.&nbsp; Bendix 
	became Concertmaster of the
	Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in the 1904 -1905 season under <font color="#000080">

	Max Bendix also conducted at the Metropolitan Opera starting in 
	1905.&nbsp; In 1907, in yet another shift, Bendix went to the rival 
	Manhattan Opera Company as Concertmaster and assistant conductor, under 
	the Music Director Cleofonte Campanini (1860-1919), where he conducted the 
	Sunday night orchestral concerts.&nbsp; Max Bendix also conducted an orchestra 
	briefly in San Francisco.&nbsp; At the end of the San Francisco Symphony 1918-1919 
	season under Music Director Alfred Hertz, there was reported dissention by some 
	San Francisco Symphony musicians, who organized the 'People's Philharmonic 
	Orchestra' <sup>70</sup>.&nbsp; They invited Nikolai Sokoloff (1886-1965) to 
	be their conductor.&nbsp; This group played during the summer of 1919, but 
	meanwhile, the San Francisco Orchestra directors raised money and hired new 
	musicians to replace the defectors.&nbsp; The People's Philharmonic Orchestra 
	tried to continue with Max Bendix as their conductor, presenting popular 
	concerts in San Francisco, but eventually failed <sup>70</sup>.	&nbsp; Max Bendix 
	died in Chicago December 6, 1945, age 79 after an eventful career, having played 
	a pioneering role in the development and expansion of US orchestras.

	consisting of Geraldine Morgan, first, Eugene Boegner, second, Fritz Schaefer, 
	viola, and Paul Morgan, cello.&nbsp; Geraldine Morgan studied in Europe 
	with several of the same teachers as Maud Powell (1867-1920), including 
	Joseph Joachim (1831-1907).&nbsp; This quartet continued at least until 
	the 1900-1901 season. Eugene Boegner became a U.S. citizen in 1904.&nbsp; 
	He returned to Germany in the summer of 1916, with no subsequent record 
	of his musical activity in the U.S. thereafter.&nbsp; So, he may have 
	remained in Germany during World War 1 and thereafter.

	Verdi’s home town. From 1904-1913, Gino Nastrucci was Concertmaster 
	at La Scala, Milan, first under Toscanini (1898 – 1908) and then under 
	Tullio Serafin (1909 – 1914) <sup>21,22</sup>.&nbsp; Toscanini, who was 
	at the Metropolitan Opera from 1908-1915 invited Gino Nastrucci to come 
	to the Metropolitan Orchestra in 1913. Nastrucci was a long-time friend 
	of Toscanini, and Sacchi says that Nastrucci was 'always cheerful, always 
	joking' <sup>21</sup>. Gino Nastrucci came to the U.S. in September, 
	1913.&nbsp; The Musician’s Union agreed to waive the 6 months waiting 
	period, and Nastrucci joined the orchestra in November for the 1913-1914

	Gino Nastrucci also performed with Metropolitan Opera conductor Artur

	1924, Gino Nastrucci seems to have returned to Italy, and performed 
	in Europe.&nbsp; From 1925-1927, Nastrucci seems to have served as 
	a musician on Italian cruise ships on a series of crossings of the 
	Atlantic.&nbsp; In 1927 Nastrucci is listed as conducting in 
	Wiesbaden, Germany.&nbsp; From about 1930, Gino Nastrucci 
	had returned to conduct at La Scala Milan.&nbsp; From 1927

	Leopold Kramer was born in 1870 in 
	Prague, then part of Austria.&nbsp; He studied at the Prague 
	Conservatory, and after graduating in about 1890, became 
	Concertmaster of the Gürzenich Orchestra of Cologne, Germany.
	&nbsp; Kramer was then Concertmaster of the Amsterdam

	just before coming to Chicago, the Concertmaster of the St. 
	Petersburg Philharmonic.&nbsp; In 1897, Leopold Kramer came to 
	Chicago to join Theodore Thomas's Chicago Symphony.&nbsp; &nbsp; 
	In November, 1909, after Theodore Thomas's death (in 1906), with 
	Frederick Stock now Music Director, Kramer became angry at 
	remarks made by Stock.&nbsp; Leopold Kramer then impulsively quit 
	the Orchestra.&nbsp; Kramer quickly regretted his action and tried 
	to retract his resignation, but it was too late.&nbsp; Kramer then 
	moved to the Chicago Grand Opera.&nbsp; Later, Leopold Kramer 
	became Concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic for one season, 
	1913-1914.&nbsp; As was the practice of European musicians in that 
	era, Kramer returned to Europe during the summer of 1914.&nbsp; 
	Apparently, he was blocked from returning to New York, because of 
	the outbreak of World War 1.&nbsp; Leopold Kramer was replaced at 
	New York Philharmonic as Concertmaster by Maximilian Pilzer.&nbsp; 
	Leopold Kramer was later Concertmaster of the Metropolitan Opera 
	Orchestra for one season, 1922-1923.&nbsp; Established in New York City, 
	Leopold Kramer taught at the Institute for Musical Arts (later renamed 
	Juilliard) 1920-1924.&nbsp; In the summer of 1924, Kramer returned 
	to Prague to teach, where he lived at least until 1936. &nbsp;

	Michael Rosenker was born in St. Petersburg, Russia on November 
	23, 1895.&nbsp; As a youth, Rosenker studied with Pyotr Stoliarsky 
	(1871-1944) in Odessa, (at that time) Russia.&nbsp; He then enrolled 
	in the St. Petersburg conservatory to study with Sergei Korguyev 
	(1863-1932), who was the teacher of Mischa Mischakoff.&nbsp; 
	But when Rosenker learned that Leopold Auer would accept 
	him, he decided to transfer.&nbsp; Anne Mischakoff Heiles in her 
	wonderful book <i><u>America's Concertmasters.</u></i> tells the 
	story:
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left:27px" align="left">
	'...Korguyev was enraged and told Rosenker, 'You're not leaving 
	for Auer; I'm throwing your out !...' <sup>80</sup>.&nbsp;
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:13px" align="left">
	Rosenker studied with Auer in Vienna for three years, and 
	also played in the Vienna Volksoper.&nbsp; In 1917, Rosenker 
	toured Asia, and too this opportunity to leave the Soviet Union.&nbsp; 
	He awaited the arrival of his daughter, and then Rosenker 
	came to the U.S. in 1922.&nbsp; Upon his arrival in New York City, 
	he played violin with Erno Rapée's (1891-1945) Capital Theater Orchestra, 
	sitting next to Concertmaster Eugene Ormandy <sup>80</sup>.&nbsp; 
	During the late 1920s and into the 1930s, Michael Rosenker continued 
	as violinist in theater orchestras, and the NBC radio staff orchestra, 
	which were desirable positions, offering year-around employment (not the 
	case with even the major symphony orchestras, then).&nbsp; Michael 
	Rosenker was Concertmaster of the MET Orchestra for two 
	seasons, 1940-1942.&nbsp; In 1940, Rosenker also performed 
	the U.S. premiere of the Castelnuovo-Tedesco Violin Sonata 
	with the composer.&nbsp; Then, in the 1942-1943 season, Michael 
	Rosenker joined the Pittsburgh Symphony under Fritz Reiner for one 
	season.&nbsp; Reiner called Rosenker 'the Rock of Gibraltar' 
	<sup>77</sup> and evidently appreciated him.&nbsp; Rosenker 
	got along with Fritz Reiner, whom he also admired, 
	but was quickly hired away by the New York Philharmonic.&nbsp In the 
	1943-1944 season, Rosenker became Associate Concertmaster of the 
	New York Philharmonic, where he remained until the end of the 
	1961-1962 season.&nbsp; Interestingly, Michael Rosenker shows up with 
	John Corigliano Sr. and several other NY Philharmonic musicians 
	in the 1947 film 'Carnegie Hall'.&nbsp; Michael Rosenker became 
	Concertmaster again, with the Baltimore Symphony for two seasons, 
	1962-1964 and then in Tokyo with the Yomiuri Nippon Symphony 
	during the 1966-1967 season.&nbsp; In the late 1960s,  
	Rosenker moved to California, where he was Concertmaster with 
	the Monterey Symphony 1967-1968.&nbsp; However, Rosenker had a 
	falling out with with the Monterey conductor (now long forgotten) 
	Jan De Jong, which resulted in both leaving the 
	orchestra.&nbsp; Michael Rosenker 
	died in Carmel, California, on December 16, 1996 at age 101.

	&nbsp; Kolberg was later Concertmaster of the Lyric Theatre of Chicago 
	(The Chicago Opera).&nbsp; After 35 years as a concertmaster of

	Raymond Gniewek was born in November, 1931 in East 
	Meadow, Long Island, New York.&nbsp; 
	He studied at the Eastman School of Music, where Max 
	Rudolf who was at that time an assistant manager at the 
	MET worked with Gniewek.&nbsp; Max Rudolf also advised 
	Gniewek of the Concertmaster opening 
	at the MET.&nbsp; When in 1957 Raymond 
	Gniewek was selected as Concertmaster of the 
	Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, he was at age 25, 
	the youngest Orchestra musician.&nbsp; Also, 
	often the press said Gniewek 'the first American-born 
	concertmaster', (or perhaps the second, 75 years after Nahan 
	Franko).&nbsp; Gniewek was quickly both popular and respected 
	by the public and his colleagues.&nbsp; It is said that 
	during his career with the Metropolitan Opera, Gniewek led 
	some 115 different opera scores.&nbsp;  Gniewek married 
	Metropolitan Opera star soprano Judith Blegen (1941 - ) 
	in 1977.&nbsp; After 43 years at the MET, Raymond 
	Gniewek retired in May, 2000, but remains active.&nbsp; 
	He taught at the Tanglewood Music 
	Center and the youth of the Verbier Festival Youth Orchestra 
	in Switzerland.&nbsp; Invited by Seiji Ozawa, Raymond 
	Gniewek was also Concertmaster of Tokyo Opera no Mori 
	Orchestra each Spring during the mid-2000s.&nbsp; Admired by 
	James Levine, with whom Gniewek played for 29 seasons, 
	Levine told New York Times writer Anthony Tommasini 
	'...The single luckiest thing that happened 
	to me since I have been at the Met is that Ray Gniewek 
	was the concertmaster.'&nbsp; In the same article, Gniewek 
	explained part of his art: '...It's my job to make technical 
	translations of the desired sound.&nbsp; And you have to 
	show, not tell, because the same words can mean different 
	things to different people.'&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp; 
	Following his decision to retire from the MET, Gniewek 
	agreed to remain an additional season to assure the 
	smooth transition to his successor Concertmaster, Nick 
	Eanet.&nbsp; After 
	43 seasons leading the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, 
	Raymond Gniewek made a lasting impact on the qualities 
	of the orchestra.&nbsp; Working closely with James Levine, 
	and particularly during the period from about 1980-1996, 
	a very fine opera orchestra was transformed into a group 
	equal to the world's leading symphony orchestras.

	1902-1903 season, he joined the violin section of the Metropolitan 
	Opera Orchestra.&nbsp; He was later advanced to the Principal viola

	In 1916, Josef Pasternack joined the staff of the Victor Talking

	and conducting the Victor Orchestra in many recordings.&nbsp; 
	Also in the 1920s, Pasternack stated that he had conducted the 
	Chicago Symphony and Boston Symphony, but without giving details 
	<sup>115</sup>.&nbsp; Beginning in 1928, Josef Pasternack conducted 
	the NBC radio staff musicians in New York City, with concerts broadcast 
	right up to his early death at age 61.&nbsp; Josef Pasternack died 
	in Chicago on May 2, 1940.

	Some notes on the Principal viola position.&nbsp;
	Albino DiJanni was Principal viola until 1936.&nbsp; In a blind audition 
	in 1936, John A. DiJanni, Albino's son took over 
	as Principal viola from his father in 1936, which he continued until 
	1975.&nbsp; John DiJanni later in his career became the MET Orchestra 
	Manager until 1975, when he retired to Santa Fe, New Mexico

	David Berkowitz, long-time violist of the Metropolitan Opera 
	Orchestra tells an amusing 1936 story of 
	auditioning for the MET orchestra <sup>9</sup> &quot;...I overheard the 
	conductors saying...’elder DiJanni was still the best. We must in all 
	fairness re-engage him as first viola’. Then came the next choice. 
	Who would be assistant and sit with him at the first stand? They 
	said that the young DiJanni sounded very well…and decided to seat 
	him to share the stand with his father. Well it so happened they 
	were mistaken. The one they thought was Albino DiJanni was John and 
	vice versa. So they reversed the decision and John become first 
	violin, and the father Albino, was seated next to him...&quot; Perhaps an 
	apocryphal story, but amusing all the same.&nbsp;

	Victor Herbert was born in Dublin in February 1, 1859.&nbsp;  Victor's 
	father Edward Herbert died when Victor was an infant, and subsequently, 
	Victor and his mother Fanny Lover moved to London.&nbsp; Fanny then 
	married a German physician, Carl Schmidt.&nbsp; In 1867, Victor joined his 
	mother in their home in Stuttgart, Germany where he continued to 
	receive a musical education, and studied cello with Bernhard Cossmann 
	(1822-1910) in Baden-Baden as a teenager from about 1875-1878.&nbsp; 
	Herbert then became a soloist and orchestra player.&nbsp; In about 1876, 
	Victor Herbert entered the Stuttgart Conservatory for further study 
	with Max Seifritz.&nbsp; Herbert graduated in 1879.&nbsp; In 1880, 
	Victor Herbert was Principal cello for a year in the orchestra of 
	Eduard Strauss in Vienna.&nbsp; In 1881, Herbert joined the Court Orchestra 
	of Stuttgart, where he remained until 1886.&nbsp; In Stuttgart, 
	he performed as a cello soloist, including in several of his early 
	compositions.&nbsp; In 1885, he also began teaching cello at the 
	Neuer Stuttgarter Musikschule, just established.&nbsp; On August 14, 
	1886, Victor Herbert married Therese Föster (1861-1927), of the Stuttgart 
	Opera.&nbsp; Later that same year, 1886 the Metropolitan Opera 
	Company hired Therese Herbert-Föster as Aida in the first U.S. production of the 
	opera, and Herbert joined the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra as first cellist.&nbsp; 
	Together Therese and Victor Herbert decided to settle in the United States.&nbsp; 
	Beginning in 1888, through his friend Anton Seidl, Victor Herbert worked with 
	the New York Philharmonic, as an assistant conductor, and solo cello soloist.&nbsp; 
	This continued for the next 11 seasons until the end of the 1897-1898 season 
	(also the time of Anton Seidl's sudden death in March, 1898).&nbsp; 
	Then, from 1898 to 1904 Victor Herbert was conductor of the Pittsburgh 
	Symphony.&nbsp; Victor Herbert was a prolific composer, including of 43 operettas, 
	and two less successful grand operas.&nbsp; Although he is said to have appeared 
	always in good health, Victor Herbert died suddenly of a heart attack on 
	May 26, 1924, just after his final operetta, 'Dream Girl' began its pre-Broadway 
	performances.

	Mischa Elman, first violin.&nbsp; The Elman Quartet also recorded 
	for Victor records in 1927, and in the same year, was the first 
	cellist to be recorded on a sound movie. In the 1940s, Horace Britt 
	formed the Britt Trio.&nbsp; From 1947-1950, Britt was 
	visiting Professor at the University of Texas, Austin, and then joined

	when he retired as Professor Emeritus,&nbsp; Horace 
	Britt died in Austin, Texas on February 3, 1971, age 89.

	Heinrich Warnke was born in Wesselburen (north of Hamburg), Germany 
	in 1870.&nbsp; At age 12, he entered the Hamburg 
	Conservatory where he studied cello with Albert Gowa (1843-after 
	1918).&nbsp; 
	In about 1887, he went to Leipzig where he played with the 
	Gewandhaus Orchestra. Prior to Boston, Heinrich Warnke was first 
	cello of the 'Kaim Orchestra' in Munich, predecessor to today's 
	Munich Philharmonic from 1897-1905.&nbsp; In the 1905-1906 
	season, after the resignation of Rudolph Krasselt, Warnke came to 
	Boston to become Principal cello at the Boston Symphony.&nbsp; 
	Heinrich Warnke's brother, Johannes Warnke, born in Germany 
	December 3, 1871 also joined the Boston Symphony, 
	remaining with the Orchestra at least until 1931.&nbsp; 
	Heinrich Warnke remained Principal cello of the Boston Symphony for 
	eight seasons.&nbsp; At the end of the 1913-1914 season, perhaps 
	due to the return of Karl Muck, Heinrich Warnke was replaced by 
	Joseph Malkin as Principal cello.&nbsp; Warnke, however, remained 
	with the Boston Symphony until the end of the 1917-1918 season. 
	From 1920 until the early 1930s, Heinrich Warnke was co-Principal 
	cello of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.&nbsp; Heinrich 
		Warnke died in Germany during the summer of 1938.

	comprising different operas would be too much for a bassoon or a 
	horn player to sustain, without burn-out or loss of performance quality.

	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
	For this reason, there 
	were Principal players and &quot;alternate Principal&quot; or 
	&quot;Associate Principal&quot; players, or sometimes 
	&quot;Co-Principal&quot;, sometimes 
	with the Principal having an edge in stature over the Associate 
	Principal, either through seniority, or by reputation.&nbsp; In 
	other cases, the two Principal players were considered as equals, 
	and as alternates.&nbsp; The woodwind and brass musician listings 
	below seek, where possible to 
	reflect the situation during each decade.

	Bert Gassman was born in New York City on May 29, 1911.&nbsp;  As a child, 
	Bert Gassman began with violin lessons, but changed to oboe at about age 
	thirteen.&nbsp;  At age 16, Gassman won a scholarship to the Damrosch School 
	of Music, which was later absorbed into the Juilliard School.&nbsp;  Bert 
	Gassman joined the Cleveland Orchestra oboe section at age 19 in the 
	1930-1931 season.&nbsp;  Gassman was primarily English horn solo for 
	fourteen seasons in Cleveland, 1930-1944.&nbsp;  Bert Gassman then went to 
	New York to join the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.&nbsp;  While at the 
	Metropolitan, according to Laila Storch's excellent biography of 
	Marcel Tabuteau (<i>How Do You Expect to Play the Oboe If You Can't 
	Peel a Mushroom?</i> <sup>106</sup>), Bert Gassman met Marcel Tabuteau 
	in New York, and although a seasoned professional, Gassman began 
	taking the early train to Philadelphia to study with Tabuteau.&nbsp; In 
	1938, Bert Gassman became Principal oboe of the Orquestra Sinfonica de 
	Mexico under Carlos Chavez, where he remained for 7 seasons.&nbsp; 
	Gassman played English horn in the famous 1946 Stravinsky recording 
	of his <i>Pastorale for Violin, Oboe, English Horn, Clarinet and 
	Bassoon</i> with Joseph Szigeti, violin, Mitch Miller, oboe, Robert 
	McGinnis, clarinet, and Sol Schoenbach, bassoon in New York.&nbsp; 
	Then, George Szell, taking up the Music Direction in Cleveland, and 
	who had conducted Bert Gassman many times, hired him back to the 
	Cleveland Orchestra as Principal oboe in Szell's second and third 
	seasons, 1947-1949.&nbsp;  Bert Gassman then left for the Los Angeles 
	Philharmonic, where he was Principal oboe for twenty-five seasons, 
	1949-1974.&nbsp; Bert Gassman died in Orange County, California on 
	November 14, 2004, age 93.

	John Ferrillo was born in Massachusetts in 1955.&nbsp; He was 
	raised in Bedford, Massachusetts in a musical family.&nbsp; Ferrillo's 
	mother was a music teacher with a Masters degree in 
	music education.&nbsp; As a youth, Ferrillo played oboe in the 
	Greater Boston Youth Symphony.&nbsp; John Ferrillo then followed

	of the Philadelphia Orchestra, where he received his Artist’s 
	Diploma and Artist’s Certificate in the Class of 1977.&nbsp; 
	Ralph Gomberg, Alfred Genovese and John de Lancie were all 
	pupils of the legendary oboist and teacher 
	<a href="Philadelphia_Orchestra_Musicians.htm#Marcel Tabuteau">
	<font color="#000080"><i><u>
	Marcel Tabuteau
	</u></i></font></a>
	at the Curtis Institute.&nbsp; Ferrillo studied at the Blossom Music 
	Festival with John Mack.&nbsp; He also participated at the Marlboro Music 
	Festival.&nbsp; Upon graduation from Curtis in 1977, John Ferrillo 
	freelanced for a year.&nbsp; In 1977, he also played Principal oboe 
	with the suburban Washington D.C. Fairfax Symphony Orchestra.&nbsp; For 
	six years during the late 1970s and early 1980s, John Ferrillo taught 
	at the University of West Virginia.&nbsp; He was constantly working 
	towards a major symphony orchestra position during these years.&nbsp; 
	In interviews, John Ferrillo has pointed out the challenges for a 
	beginning musician to build a career.&nbsp; He said that he 
	&quot;blew off&quot; nine years and 21 auditions, prior to landing 
	his first position as assistant Principal oboe of the San Francisco 
	Symphony <sup>54</sup>.&nbsp; Ferrillo in May, 1985 won the competition 
	to become second oboe of the San Francisco Symphony to begin in the 
	1985-1986 season, under Herbert Blomstedt.&nbsp; Then, only months 
	later, in September, 1985, Ferrillo won the Principal oboe audition 
	for the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.&nbsp; Ferrillo joined the MET 
	for the 1986-1987 season, and remained as Principal Oboe for fifteen 
	seasons, 1986 to 2001.&nbsp; At the same time as his tenure at the 
	Metropolitan Opera, Ferrillo taught oboe at the Juilliard School.&nbsp; 
	Then, in 2001, Ferrillo succeeded Alfred Genovese, Principal oboe 
	of the Boston Symphony who had retired at the end of the 1997-1998 
	season.&nbsp; Ferrillo also began to teach at Boston University 
	and the New England Conservatory.&nbsp; John Ferrillo is admired 
	for his singing tone and phrasing, which some speculate may have 
	been reinforced during his years at the Metropolitan Opera.&nbsp; 
	John Ferrillo's colleagues observe that his way of shaping and 
	phrasing a line of music, and his intensity bring alive the teaching 
	of Ferrillo's great mentor John de Lancie.&nbsp; Who could wish 
	for higher praise?

	Hugo Burghauser was born in Vienna February 27, 1896 of a German father 
	and Italian mother.&nbsp; Burghauser 
	was former Principal bassoon with the Vienna State Opera/Vienna 
	Philharmonic, but, although not Jewish, was dismissed 
	for political reasons.&nbsp; Burghauser said that he chose 
	the bassoon so as to gain a scholarship at the 
	Vienna Conservatory.&nbsp; His teacher in Vienna was Hans Boehm.&nbsp; Following 
	World War 1, where Burghauser served in a regimental band, he auditioned for 
	the Vienna State Opera, at that time directed by Richard Strauss.&nbsp; Burghauser 
	was at the Vienna State Opera for 17 seasons.&nbsp; He said that the repertoire 
	would typically include some sixty different operas during a 10-month season.&nbsp; 
	Therefore, extensive rehearsal of all these works was not feasible, and the 
	musicians had to learn them separately.&nbsp; He said "...One acquired fast and 
	accurate sight reading ability..." <sup>55</sup>&nbsp; In 1932, 
	in the world-wide economic depression, Hugo Burghauser was designated 
	as administrator of the Vienna State Opera/Vienna Philharmonic.&nbsp; In the 
	Wiener Staatsoper tradition, Burghauser was, apparently, a musical 
	politician, making a number of enemies <sup>56</sup>.&nbsp; In the 1930s, Vienna 
	switched to a system of guest conductors, including Bruno Walter and Arturo 
	Toscanini.&nbsp; At was at this time that Burghauser got to know 
	Toscanini.&nbsp; Burghauser (with an Italian mother) at the Salzburg 
	Festival became an 
	intermediary between the Festival and Arturo Toscanini.&nbsp; 
	In 1938, Germany invaded Austria, and although not Jewish, 
	Burghauser was politically unwelcome.&nbsp; He left Austria with virtually  
	no money and made his way with difficulty to Paris.&nbsp; He heard that 
	Toronto was looking for a bassoon, and made this his objective.&nbsp;  
	Aided by Signora Carla Toscanini (Toscanini's wife), he left Paris for 
	New York, and then Toronto arriving late in 1938.&nbsp; 
	Burghauser stayed with the Toronto Symphony for three seasons.&nbsp; 
	In 1942, Burghauser became second bassoon and contrabassoon with the 
	Metropolitan Opera, when Stephen Maxym and other bassoons were inducted into
	the U.S. Army.&nbsp; Burghauser became a U.S. citizen 
	in 1946.&nbsp; Burghauser remained with the Metropolitan 
	Opera Orchestra 1942-1965.&nbsp; After retiring, Burghauser continued to 
	teach in New York City, where he died on December 9, 1982.

	Stephen Maxym was born in New York City July 17, 1915.&nbsp; Maxym tells 
	his experience as a Stuyvasant High School student, meeting Sol Schoenbach 
	who lent him reeds, and give some suggestions about bassoon 
	embouchure.&nbsp; At Stuyvesant, Maxym auditioned for a New York Philharmonic 
	scholarship to study with their musicians.&nbsp; In 1931, Maxym auditioned with 
	Simon Kovar, Philharmonic Principal bassoon, and since there were only four 
	candidates for six scholarships, he said, Maxym won <sup>38</sup>.&nbsp; 
	After study with Simon Kovar, Stephen Maxym gained a scholarship to the 
	at the Institute of Musical Arts (Juilliard) in 1933.&nbsp; After three 
	years at the Institute, he was offered a position the Pittsburgh Symphony 
	Orchestra under Fritz Reiner as Principal bassoon starting with 1937-1938 
	season.&nbsp; It was too good for Maxym to turn down, and he needed the 
	money, so he dropped out of Juilliard <sup>38</sup>.&nbsp Maxym says 
	that in 1939, at the beginning of his third season 
	at Pittsburgh, he became fed up with the treatment from Fritz Reiner, and 
	quit.&nbsp; Maxym auditioned with Erich Leinsdorf to join the Metropolitan 
	Opera and fortunately was hired in January, 1940, mid-season of 1939-1940, following 
	the sudden death of his predecessor.&nbsp; Maxym said that otherwise, no one
	would believe he had quit Pittsburgh, but rather that Reiner had fired 
	him.&nbsp. In 1942, Maxym entered the U.S. Army as a radio operator.&nbsp; 
	In the 1946-1947 season, after considering auditioning for the Chicago 
	Symphony, Maxym was re-hired as the Metropolitan Opera's 
	Principal oboe for the 1946-1947 season.&nbsp; When Fritz Reiner 
	came to the MET as a conductor, he had not forgotten that Maxym 
	had resigned in Pittsburgh, and tried to make performance 
	difficult for him.&nbsp; Maxym confronted Reiner, and as Reiner was 
	sometimes to do with others, Reiner thereafter respected 
	Maxym and treated him well.&nbsp; Maxym played under all the great 
	conductors of the Metropolitan Opera, an resigned at the 
	end of the 1975-1976 season, early in the regime of James Levine&nbsp; 
	During his tenure at the MET, Maxym taught at Juilliard (1950-1995
	<sup>39</sup>) 
	and at the Manhattan School of Music.&nbsp; In 1995, 
	Maxym moved to Orange County, California and began teaching 
	at the University of Southern California, until his death 
	in 2002.&nbsp; Stephen Maxym died 
	in Laguna Hills, California on October 12, 2002.

	To further his development, David Webber went to New York City in the 1930s.&nbsp; 
	There he studied with Simeon Bellison, then Principal clarinet of the New York 
	Philharmonic, and also with Daniel Bonade, at that time Principal clarinetist of 
	the Columbia Broadcasting System radio orchestra.&nbsp; In 1938, David Weber was 
	hired by Arthur Rodzinski to join the clarinet section of the NBC Symphony 
	Orchestra, where he stayed two seasons.&nbsp; In 1940, David Weber was appointed 
	Principal clarinet of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, alternating with Luigi 
	Cancellieri.&nbsp; Weber was at the MET for three seasons.&nbsp David Weber was 
	then appointed assistant 
	Principal clarinet in the New York Philharmonic 1943-1944.&nbsp; He was Principal 
	clarinet of the New York City Ballet Orchestra 1960-1986.&nbsp; After leaving the 
	New York City Ballet, Weber taught at both Columbia University and at the Juilliard 
	School.&nbsp; David Weber had the reputation of being strict, but supportive 
	with his students, and inflexible in his relations with colleagues, and even 
	with conductors <sup>67</sup>.&nbsp; David Weber died in New York City 
	on January 23, 2006.

	Luigi (or sometimes Louis) Cancellieri was born in Rome in June 21, 
	1895.&nbsp; Cancellieri studied with Aurelio Magnani at the St. 
	Cecilia Conservatory in Rome. In the early 1920s, after its 
	re-opening, Cancellieri was Principal clarinet at La Scala Milan 
	under Toscanini until the end of the 1923-1924 season. Luigi 
	Cancellieri then emigrated to the U.S. in the summer of 1924, and 
	became a citizen. He became Principal clarinet of the Metropolitan 
	Opera Orchestra. Cancellieri was said by Gunther Schuller and other colleagues to have 
	a rich, full clarinet sound, immediately identifiable.&nbsp; Luigi 
	Cancellieri lived for years above Carnegie Hall, a convenient location.&nbsp; 
	Cancellieri used a crystal or glass mouthpiece on his clarinet, just 
	as Gino Cioffi and Robert Marcellus were said to have done, at least in part.&nbsp; 
	Luigi Cancellieri died in 1959.

	flute with the New York Symphony under Leopold Damrosch from 
	1877 to about 1885.&nbsp; In the 1885-1886 season, Wehner was solo

	William Hayes, Susan Berdahl wrote: &quot;...While Carl Wehner, first 
	flutist with the Metropolitan Opera Company Orchestra, was touring 
	in Boston he had occasion to use one of William Haynes’ early flutes 
	made while he was still with J.C. Haynes and Co. in 1898. Wehner 
	liked the flute so much that he purchased it for one hundred dollars 
	and subsequently was responsible for the sale of six more Haynes 
	flutes to his friends and colleagues...&quot;, which helped establish Haynes’s 
	reputation <sup>15</sup>.&nbsp; However, it seems Wehner did not 
	like metal flutes.&nbsp; Leonardo De Lorenzo, a student of Carl 
	Wehner stated &quot;...I regret to say that Carl Wehner's hatred for the 
	metal flute was excessive and exaggerated.&nbsp; In spite of his 
	financial difficulties in his last years, he would never hear or 
	teach anyone with a metal flute!&quot; <sup>16</sup>.&nbsp; Georges 
	Barrère was gaining new flute students at Wehner's expense 
	<sup>63</sup>.&nbsp; Flutists were more and more prefering 
	the lighter French sound played with 
	a metal flute.&nbsp; Carl Wehner died in New York City in 1912.

	Xavier Reiter was born in Munich, Germany in March 1857.&nbsp; He 
	came to the United States in 1886 to join the Boston Symphony as 
	Principal horn under Wilhelm Gericke.&nbsp; Reiter 
	settled in Boston and he became a citizen in 
	1890.&nbsp; Reiter was often during his career in Boston and New 
	York referred to is the greatest horn player in the U.S.&nbsp; 
	As well as being a gifted horn player, Reiter was apparently what we 
	refer to as a &quot;character&quot;.&nbsp; He wore his hair down over his 
	shoulders and also a beard and full moustache, as can be seen in the 
	photograph below.&nbsp; His total appearance seems to have been 
	something like Buffalo Bill.&nbsp; In the January 14, 1890 New York 
	Times article entitled &quot;A Missing Horn Player&quot;, it further states 
	that Reiter &quot;...wears a big, broad-brimmed Texas slouch hat...and 
	his manly form is enrapped in a big fur 
	overcoat...&quot;<sup>102</sup>&nbsp; 
	According to David Mannes autobiography, it seems that Reiter 
	decided to leave Boston and the BSO when he and his two large 
	Russian Wolfhounds were arrested in the Boston Commons for bathing 
	his dogs in a public fountain <sup>103</sup>.&nbsp; It would seem 
	difficult to be arrested for such a reason, but then Reiter was 
	'larger than life'.&nbsp; This image is reinforced by an amusing 
	account by the great horn player Milan Yancich (brother of Charles Yancich) 
	about Xavier Reiter.&nbsp; '...[Reiter's] transportation was a bicycle. 
	He often wore a tam and a cape training in the wind. He looked like Count 
	Dracula in persuit of a victim. His horn was slung across his back as he rode 
	across the Boston Commons on his bicycle...'<sup>104</sup>.&nbsp;

	After 1890, Reiter became Principal horn 
	of the New York Philharmonic Society during the 1910s.&nbsp; 
	At that time, he also helped form the Philharmonic Ensemble, a 
	wind quintet with violin consisting of

	 <sup>146</sup>.&nbsp;  
	Earlier, in the 1900s, Reiter was Principal horn of the Metropolitan 
	Opera Orchestra under Seidel, where he could enjoy his favorite 
	operas, particularly Wagner.&nbsp; It is said that Reiter was 
	instrumental in convincing his town in Westchester County, New York 
	to rename itself &quot;Valhalla&quot;, Reiter being an avid admirer 
	of Richard Wagner and his Ring cycle.&nbsp; Bruno Jaenicke, the great 
	Boston horn player (1913-1918) and later Principal horn of the New York 
	Philharmonic wrote of Reiter (in an article edited by that 
	other great Boston Symphony horn, Harold Meek 1943-1963) '... I want to mention 
	a horn player who uses the B-flat horn, but whose tone is as velvety 
	and as poetical as that of any F horn players I have known. He is Mr. 
	Xavier Reiter. I remember the first impression which his playing 
	made on me. It was in Boston about 14 years ago. The New York 
	Philharmonic played in Symphony Hall. Mischa Elman played the 
	Scotch Fantasy, but when Reiter had the melody for only a few 
	bars, he overshadowed Elman. But Reiter can sing on his horn. 
	And we other fellows better stick to the F horn.' 
	<sup>105</sup>.&nbsp; Xavier Reiter died in May, 1938.

	Herbert L. Clarke, one of

	Twentieth century at a time when cornet playing was at its height.&nbsp; 
	Herbert Clarke was bon in Woburn, Massachusetts on September 12, 
	1867.&nbsp; Clarke's father was a musician and organist, and 
	Clarke's early musical education was on the violin.&nbsp; Because of his 
	father's organist profession, the family moved often, and to Toronto in 
	1880.&nbsp; Herbert Clarke first studied violin, and interestingly, in 1881, 
	at age 14, he was a second violinist in the Toronto Philharmonic.&nbsp; 
	However, Clarke states in his autobiography that also in 1881, the American 
	Band visited Toronto, where Clarke heard the cornet playing of 
	Bowen R. Church.&nbsp; In the United States at the time, and until 
	about the 1930s, there was a great entertainment tradition of 
	cornet solo playing with bands, lost in today's availability of music 
	from numerous sources.&nbsp; In 1893, Clarke joined the Sousa Band as a 
	cornet soloist.&nbsp; In 1893, Clarke also played in the Chicago World's 
	Fair, continuing to play with different bands during the mid-1890s.&nbsp; 
	In about the 1898-1899 season, Herbert L. Clarke was second trumpet with 
	the New York Philharmonic under Emil Paur.&nbsp; The next season, 1899-1900, 
	Herbert Clark was Principal trumpet of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.&nbsp;
	From abotu 1900 to 1917, Herbert L. Clarke played again in the Sousa Band, 
	including leading it in recording sessions of the Sousa Band for Victor 
	Talking Machine Company.&nbsp; Clarke also recorded for the Edison, Columbia, and 
	Brunswick labels.&nbsp; 1917-1923, Herbert Clarke returned to Ontario, Canada where 
	he directed a band, composed, and taught trumpet.&nbsp; In 1923, Herbert Clarke 
	and his wife moved to Long Beach, California for his wife's health.&nbsp; In 
	California, Clarke Long Beach Municipal Band until 1943.&nbsp; 
	Herbert L. Clarke died in Long Beach on January 30, 1945.

	Christian Rodenkirchen was born in Hennef, 30 km south of 
	Cologne, Germany on February 19, 1858.&nbsp; Rodenkirchen played 
	cornet in a regimental band in Cologne in 1883 <sup>34</sup>.&nbsp; 
	Shortly thereafter, Christian Rodenkirchen emigrated to the US, and 
	seems to have settled first in the Chicago area.&nbsp; During his 
	constantly changing career Rodenkirchen was first trumpet of a number of 
	leading American Orchestras from 1891 to 1915.&nbsp; In 1890, he 
	was a member of a mid-west touring orchestra, the Aamold Concert 
	Company, conducted by August Aamold (1863-after 1930).&nbsp; Rodenkirchen 
	joined the trumpet section at the founding of the Chicago Symphony 
	in the 1891-1892 season as first cornet.&nbsp; Rodenkirchen was first 
	cornet and then Principal trumpet of the Chicago Symphony for eleven 
	seasons, 1891-1902.&nbsp; He then seems to have had a falling-out with 
	Theodore Thomas, and Rodenkirchen's contract for the next season was not 
	renewed.&nbsp; Rodenkirchen then became Principal trumpet of the New 
	York Symphony during the 1903-1904 season under Walter Damrosch.&nbsp; 
	The next season, Rodenkirchen became Principal Trumpet of the 
	Metropolitan Opera for the 1904-1905 season.&nbsp; Continuing his 
	peripatetic career journey, Christian Rodenkirchen then joined the 
	New York Philharmonic as first trumpet from 1905-1907.&nbsp; 
	In New York in 1907, Rodenkirchen married his second wife, Maria 
	MacNally, 20 years younger. He moved to the Philadelphia Orchestra 
	for two seasons as Principal trumpet under Karl Pohlig 1907-1909.&nbsp; 
	Rodenkirchen then returned to the New York Philharmonic (it would seem 
	as first trumpet) from 1909-1911 during the years of Gustav Mahler as 
	Music Director <sup>34</sup>.&nbsp;Rodenkirchen then returned to the 
	Philadelphia Orchestra as second trumpet from 1911 until his early 
	death on February 6, 1915, just days before his 57th birthday.&nbsp; 
	Because of his early death, Christian Rodenkirchen did not finish the 
	Philadelphia Orchestra 1914-1915 season, ending his restless career.&nbsp; 
	Christian Rodenkirchen, through his many students was, like Max Schlossberg 
	(1873-1936), an early creator of what became to be considered an American 
	school of trumpet playing <sup>114</sup>.
