The latest Execuvue version delivers actionable insights to hotel operators on a mobile-ready platform with an unlimited combination of user-defined report layouts. ”Execuvue also leverages recent advances in text analytic technology.  The system can convert written online ratings, comment card detail, and other guest-satisfaction measures into quantifiable metrics.  When operators can match guest sentiment data with daily performance and their competitive set, the result is actionable information they can use to make quick corrections and optimize revenues.    Operators leverage Aptech’s solutions to increase profitability “The four new Aptech clients are a great example of how hotel companies are leveraging financial solutions to better manage their companies and increase profitability,” said Cam Troutman, vice president of Aptech Computer Systems.  “Our solutions are helping these hotels make smarter decisions based on data and industry intelligence.”   San Ysidro Ranch, named the number one resort in the continental U.S. and Canada for 2010 by  Travel + Leisure magazine, selected Aptech’s Targetvue® to  improve budgeting and forecasting .  Targetvue is a hospitality-driven budgeting and forecasting solution that eliminates the need for correcting and recombining multiple spreadsheets.  Targetvue’s consolidated forecasts and reports may be fully integrated with both Execuvue and Profitvue.       Additional hotel companies in California and Ohio will implement Aptech’s Profitvue multi-property accounting system to streamline their back office processes.  Profitvue ® is the most widely used accounting solution designed for the hospitality industry.      Aptech Computer Systems Aptech Computer Systems, Inc., based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, leads the hospitality industry in leveraging change by valuing human relationships and applying technology to solve business problems for people.
