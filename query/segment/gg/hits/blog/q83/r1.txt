The Oscar-winning actor sat down with the British TV host and, amongst other things, discussed his belief that the right wing Tea Party's anti-Obama stance is rooted in racism. When asked by Morgan whether Obama's presidency has made racism in the United States better or worse, Freeman, who once played apartheid-defying South African president Nelson Mandela, frankly stated that his time in office has made it worse, as he has become a target of the right's aggression. "Their stated policy, publicly stated, is to do whatever it takes to see to it that Obama only serves one term," the actor said. "What’s, what does that, what underlines that? 'Screw the country. We’re going to whatever we do to get this black man, we can, we’re going to do whatever we can to get this black man outta here.'" Declaring once again that "it's a racist thing," Freeman said the group's rise has shown the hate still lingering in America. "Well, it just shows the weak, dark, underside of America," he said. "We’re supposed to be better than that. We really are. That’s, that’s why all those people were in tears when Obama was elected president. “Ah, look at what we are. Look at how, this is America.” You know? And then it just sort of started turning because these people surfaced like stirring up muddy water." The actor continued, saying that he understood President Obama not fighting back, seeking to stick to his principles, but wishes that he'd be more aggressive now. Freeman endorsed Obama during his run for the presidency, but  declined to campaign with him , saying that he was an actor, not a politician. He  attended a White House Civil Rights concert in 2010.

If you're refering to Cain, he is saying what he needs to say to attract white attention that's in line with what the GOP is saying.... ­basically I've got mine. What was that Cain told the protesters in NYC....tha ­t it's their fault that they didn't have jobs and wasn't millionair ­es. It kills me that folks only hear what they want to hear. Many whites think that the GOP has their backs. But think, whites are 66% of this country's population ­. Blacks and Latinos combined account for on 26 1/2%. That means even more whites are still out of works than blacks and Latinos even though the percentage is higher among those +26%. Cain isn't going to improve that. Which means that whites will still be out of work also. I suspect that's really what behind the decision not to run by Christie. This ecomomy is jacked up and it was jacked up before Obama became president and it's because of the policies of the GOP and Bush administra ­tion, which was done while he kept folks mesmorized with the SHOCK AND AWE.     marriea: Please, he's another Clarence Thomas.

When one race is exchanged for another in a film version of real life events. When film makers take a good black man who did something good, amazing, unique, new, inventive or worthy in real life, and replace him with a white man in a film version of ‘true’ events. Now that is racism. What, black people can’t do things worth re-telling as film to be seen by the masses? I am sick of this happening. Black people who achieve things in life should have their stories told truthfully and accurately when being retold to the wider audience of millions of movie-goer ­s around the world.

There is a wide streak of racism in conservati ­ve politics in the US. No, not all conservati ­ves are racists. But nearly half the country went bonkers after Obama was elected and began to howl---"OM ­G he's not American, he's not Christian, he's Kenyan, Indonesian ­, Muslim-- he's going to take our guns, institute Sharia law!!!"And the like.

Somewhere $300,000,0 ­00.oo was paid to HUFF from AOL which would seem they could slick this system up some from the torturous thing it is. When you comment on someone's comments and it doesn't show up (OR DOESN'T SHOW UP FOR A LONG TIME) for not a thing that would violate the CODE you start wondering. ­.. Since you're on the CORRECT side of HUFF you seem not to have the delay problem or lost in the sink hole problem. I'm sure it gives you a warm glow that I'm not getting...
