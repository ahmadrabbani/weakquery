And reports are starting to emerge on the Web of an alleged decade-long affair with ... his step-granddaughter. E'Dena HInes is the granddaughter of Morgan's first wife,  Jeanette Adair Bradshaw , but was raised by Morgan and Myrna. "Myrna said E'dena told her that when she was a teenager, she and Morgan went to dinner at a friend's house one evening. Both had been drinking and when they returned home Morgan attempted to have sex with her. They stopped just short of having intercourse," a close family insider told The Enquirer.   Myrna confronted Morgan about the incident, but the undercover relationship continued and escalated.  E'Dena has been Morgan's escort to several Hollywood events, including the premiere of "The Dark Knight." Freeman's rep has no comment, e-mailing us: "No comment on anything in The Enquirer."  Does this remind anyone else of that creepy  Woody Allen-Soon Yi  affair?  What do you think?

He proves to be a pervert. Janeyre | June 18, 2009 3:45 PM   To many people worry about what others do. It time more people should be worrying about themselves and their own actions, not that of others. I say, who cares if he did or if he still is. Good for him if he is. Richard | June 18, 2009 4:28 PM   Oh my!!! Marla | June 18, 2009 5:03 PM   I am sorry but if this is true SHAME ON HIS PAEDOPHILIAC SELF!!! To think i liked him (looks like my father dammit!!!) Now I will not watch shawshank redemption the same again. All these Woody Allen's running around is too mych for me. Who will it be next?? Brad Pitt loved up with Zahara when he is 60. Visha | June 18, 2009 7:48 PM   This is just dumb. If you're a movie star you meet new, beautiful people all the time. Why get involved with a member of your own family? Owen | June 18, 2009 7:52 PM   What a messed up family. Stop referring to E'Deena as Freeman's step granddaughter. He and his wife Myrna, took that child in when she was an infant. He is the only father, let alone grandfather, she has ever known. It's incest, plain and sim[le. If you think he would have reacted any differently if she had been his natural granddaughter, you are sadly mistaken. The whole situation is a mess. What kind of grandfather would watch his granddaughter get drunk at age 17. And what's up with Myrna. No woman who really loves a man would allow him to have an open marriage. Did Myrna stay in it for the money?. For years, I have regarded Morgan Freeman as my favorite actor - talented, sensitive and caring according to the roles he played. Now I see him for what he really is - a demented, ugly old man who doesn't have a loyal bone in his body and who felt entitled to do whatever he felt like doing.- with whoever would let him do it. I will not watch another Freeman movie. His granddaughter ought to sue his socks off and Myrna should do the same. I doubt if he can act his way out of the current mess. I hope NBC gets rid of him as the voice of the Olympics. What a foul misguided old man. C. White | June 18, 2009 8:04 PM   How does coming home drunk and allegedly trying to have sex one night get to be a decade long affair? It must have been a long,long, night. Also, we have heard what the woman scorned has to say, what does Morgan say? Not Impressed | June 18, 2009 8:45 PM   You idiots, this story comes from the National Enquirer. If you believe that, you will believe anything. Dumb Dumbs | June 18, 2009 10:48 PM   SAD! SAD! SAD! Heather | June 19, 2009 12:57 AM   Shame on all of you. Who cares? I would bet if we looked into each of your pasts they would be perfect. Yea Right!! Worry about your own lives. You only know what the press wants you to. There's always alot left out.
