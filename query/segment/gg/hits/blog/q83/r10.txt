More:  Bruce Almighty  Morgan Freeman        Flag  Close      Post a comment         Morgan Freeman was among those honored at the  John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts this year.  CBS broadcast the 31 st Annual Kennedy Center Honors Tuesday, December 30, and seated alongside Freeman were fellow honorees Barbra Streisand, George Jones, Twyla Tharp, Pete Townsend, and Roger Daltrey. But even among a group that included a diva, a country king, a dance queen, and a couple rock legends, Morgan Freeman's stately presence stood out. Looking more like a visiting decorated dignitary, the Kennedy Center's medal across his chest,  Morgan Freeman exhibited the quiet dignity that his audiences have come to expect from him.  Denzel Washington presented for the Academy Award-winning 71-year-old actor. Washington told the story of his first meeting with Morgan Freeman, where he approached Freeman with an idea of expanding the role of his character in the play they were doing. He said that Freeman simply told him that they crossed swords three times, Freeman would stab him, he would fall, then die, "quickly."  It is not difficult to imagine the calmly reserved Freeman saying those words to the upstart Denzel Washington.  Just like he delivered the lines of the Bruce Wayne's weapons expert and mentor, Lucius Fox, in " The Dark Knight ."  And the calm and cool delivery he used as the older, experienced detective cautioning a  young Brad Pitt in "Seven."  And the smooth, even tones he used to  warn Jim Carrey to be careful with the powers of god in "Bruce Almighty."    1  2  3   Next Page   Published by  Saul Relative  WVU graduate, with degrees in History, English, Secondary Education, Computer Programming, and Psychology (and nearly a degree in Political Science).
