Hosted by Stephen Colbert, the Emmy® and Peabody® Award-winning " The Colbert Report " features no-holds-barred discussions in which the important topics of our time and the daily news are treated with absolutely no seriousness whatsoever. Stephen Colbert is preaching truthiness--his version of the truth and the only version that matters. He's also picking fights and winning one-sided arguments with the biggest names in the biggest house of the biggest branch of government with his unique House of Representatives segment, "Better Know A District." Other guests who have had the honor of finding out why they're just plain wrong include Barack and Michele Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Stone Phillips, Lesley Stahl, Lou Dobbs, Anderson Cooper, Fareed Zakaria, Maureen Dowd, Tom Brokaw, Christiane Amanpour, Arianna Huffington, Frank Rich, Chris Matthews, Mort Zuckerman, Steve Kroft, Connie Chung, Bob Schieffer, Paul Krugman, Bay Buchanan, Al Franken, Keith Olbermann, Paul Begala, Cokie Roberts, Peggy Noonan, Harry Smith, Carl Bernstein, Richard Clarke, David Gergen, David Brooks, Barry Scheck, Alan Dershowitz, Madeleine Albright, Ralph Nader, Jesse Jackson, Gary Hart, Robert Kennedy, Jr., Eliot Spitzer, Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer, Ned Lamont, George Lucas, Toby Keith, Mark Cuban, Bradley Whitford, Ted Danson, Martin Short, Ken Burns, Neil Young, Morgan Spurlock, Tony Hawk, Amy Sedaris, Gideon Yago, and Steve Wozniak.
