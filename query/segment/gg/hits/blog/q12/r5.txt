 bjkeefe: John McWhorter on The Colbert Report

      skip to main  |  skip to sidebar  bjkeefe   brickbats, blarney, bluster, and balderdash (and a bit of bogosity)         Sunday, August 31, 2008   John McWhorter on The Colbert Report       Posted by  Brendan   at   3:57 PM                  Labels:  vids        4 comments:         John Evo said...  I got a different view of John from this interview.    6:13 PM, August 31, 2008                Brendan said...  Better, worse, or just different? I liked seeing him have a real belly laugh. I've never seen more than a chuckle from him before.    6:16 PM, August 31, 2008                John Evo said...  Just different. Maybe he was more starched. Stiff as a rod. And all that! I could almost envision him in that wonderful photoshopping picture you did. I'm just saying... Different. He did get married a couple of years ago, right? Wonder what he was waiting for?    8:06 PM, August 31, 2008                Brendan said...  I did wonder if John was gay the first couple of times I heard him speak, too. I think it was the expressed affection for show tunes. ;^) Just for the record, once more, not my Photoshop work.    3:50 AM, September 01, 2008           Post a Comment           Newer Post    Older Post   Home   Subscribe to:  Post Comments (Atom)    ShareThis                    One reason.
