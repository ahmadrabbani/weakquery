                                            years, I want to address the
                                            dangerous potential ramifications of
                                            legalizing physician assisted
                                            suicide (PAS) from a viewpoint of
                                            personal experience. The past danger
                                            I am referring to concerns the time
                                            when I was first paralyzed. My
                                            paralysis is the result of a broken
                                            neck and spinal cord injury from a
                                            car accident in 1975. Add to this
                                            cheery scenario the fact that I was
                                            soon greeted by a doctor who told me
                                            I was not supposed to have lived as
                                            long as I had, would most likely die
                                            shortly, or, in the best case would
                                            spend the remainder of my life
                                            confined to a wheelchair and you
                                            know I was not in the best of moods.
                                            After I surprised the doctors and
                                            lived to get into rehab, they told
                                            me, at that time, the average
                                            lifespan of a male quadriplegic was
                                            36 years.</font></p>
                                            <p><font face="Verdana">By then, I
                                            would probably die from a pressure
                                            sore, kidney failure, or other
                                            related complication. That meant my
                                            best hope was 15 more years
                                            paralyzed. I'm 45 now and can look
                                            back on that laughingly. It wasn't
                                            so funny then. I spent 6 weeks
                                            getting medically stable followed by
                                            4 and a half months in
                                            rehabilitation. During that period,
                                            there were MANY times when I didn't
                                            know if I wanted to go on. What have
                                            I done since the accident? I have
                                            lived semi-independently for nearly
                                            23 years. In 1985, I graduated the
                                            University of Southern Maine with a
                                            B.A. in Communication. In 1989, I
                                            graduated Regent University in
                                            Virginia Beach with an M.A. in

                                            simply, my life has been, and

                                            productive. My past concern is
                                            simple. What would I have done if
                                            PAS had been an option when I was
                                            first injured or during any of the
                                            critical complications I've been
                                            through since. In retrospect, there
                                            were many times when I don't know. I
                                            can't begin to express the roller

                                            went through. Now, I'm incredibly
                                            grateful that PAS wasn't an option

                                            permit euthanasia and he proceeded
                                            to live a dignified life. The state
                                            of Oregon is the only state in the
                                            United States that allows voluntary
                                            euthanasia to occur legally. On
                                            January 1st, 2004, Oregon will be
                                            entering its sixth year under the
                                            Death with Dignity Act. The Death
                                            and Dignity Act legalizes voluntary
                                            euthanasia. It is imperative to
                                            understand the particular
                                            definitions of euthanasia to
                                            comprehend the public policy

                                            Euthanasia defines euthanasia as

                                            are two distinct kinds of
                                            euthanasia: voluntary and

                                            Voluntary euthanasia is when the
                                            person who is killed has requested
                                            to be killed whereas non-voluntary
                                            or involuntary euthanasia is when
                                            the person who is killed made no
                                            request and gave no consent (Hamlon).

                                            patients to their death is referred
                                            to as physican assisted suicide.

                                            that Oregon's Death and Dignity Act
                                            negatively shapes society, denies
                                            alternatives to pain, and provides
                                            dangerous precedents. Therefore,
                                            voluntary euthanasia should not be

                                            shapes what Peter Saunders, General

                                            encourages non-Oregonian citizens to
                                            engage in a controversial debate
                                            about public policy and rebel
                                            against their state policies. The

                                            opposing organizations and even in

                                            America, people are at ease with
                                            using the topic of euthanasia to
                                            gain publicity and social attention.
                                            In a 1994-1995 publication of a
                                            Committee Report addressing the
                                            legalization of euthanasia, the
                                            House of Lords of the UK Parliament
                                            states, &quot;The death of a person
                                            affects the lives of others, often

                                            cannot be foreseen. We believe that
                                            the issue of euthanasia is one in
                                            which the interest of the individual

                                            provides us with the troubling
                                            account of Patrick Matheny and his
                                            experience with euthanasia in
                                            Oregon. After Oregon Health Sciences
                                            University sent Matheny his lethal
                                            dose of drugs via Federal Express,
                                            Matheny neglected to take the lethal
                                            dose for four months. Joe Hayes,
                                            Matheny's brother in law, was there
                                            on the day that Matheny died. Hayes
                                            describes how he had to assist
                                            Matheny to his death. &quot;It
                                            doesn't go smoothly for
                                            everyone,&quot; Hayes said,
                                            &quot;For Pat, it was a huge
                                            problem. It would not have worked
                                            without help&quot; (qtd. in Hamlon).
                                            When advocates of euthanasia
                                            consider the flaws of palliative
                                            care, they should also consider the
                                            painful risks of euthanasia. Instead
                                            of resorting to euthanasia, the
                                            ultimate solution is to encourage
                                            more training and research to manage
                                            the pain of the terminally ill.</font></p>

                                            agrees that alternative treatments
                                            are effective. In Peter Singer's
                                            essay, Freedom and the Right to Die,
                                            he emphasizes the lack of options in
                                            palliative care. Therefore, he
                                            believes that if man is suffering,
                                            then he has the right to die (2). He
                                            suggests that patients that are not
                                            worthy of living can be recognized
                                            through a series of psychiatric
                                            qualifications (Singer 2). He also
                                            implies that there is training that
                                            can advise a doctor how to make the
                                            best decision concerning the patient
                                            (2). Instead of Singer's idea of
                                            devoting training efforts to
                                            encourage euthanasia, training
                                            efforts should be directed to
                                            enhancing the quality of palliative
                                            care.</font></p>

                                            before. We can do that and not
                                            eliminate life itself. As I have
                                            said many times, medicine cannot be
                                            both our healer and our killer (Koop).</font></p>

                                            Death with Dignity Act should be
                                            abolished. Voluntary euthanasia is
                                            illegitimate because it corrupts
                                            society, neglects palliatives care
                                            options, and may lead to the
                                            dangerous acceptance of involuntary
                                            euthanasia. In the end, eliminating
                                            the mercy killing law in Oregon,
                                            will protect society and preserve
                                            the value of life</font></p>
