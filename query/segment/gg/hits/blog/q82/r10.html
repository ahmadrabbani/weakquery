            <P><a name="ques1"></a><strong>What is physician  aid-in-dying?</strong>
            <P> Physician aid-in-dying (PAD) refers to a practice in  which a physician provides a competent, terminally ill patient with a  prescription for a lethal dose of medication, upon the patient's request, which  the patient intends to use to end his or her own life. (For related discussion,  see also <a href="eol.html">End  of Life Issues</a>.)<br>
            <P>              <a name="ques2"></a><strong>What role does language  play in discussions of aid-in-dying?  </strong>
            <P> A  variety of terms have historically been used to describe when a terminally ill  patient uses lethal medications for the purpose of ending his or her life (or  having control over the timing of death). &nbsp;Prior to the passage of the Oregon Death with  Dignity Act in 1996, the term most often used was &ldquo;physician-assisted suicide&rdquo;  (PAS). &nbsp;Those who use this term feel that  it is an accurate reflection of the relationship between doctor and patient and  refer to the etymological roots of suicide as &ldquo;auto-killing&rdquo; or  &ldquo;self-killing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The use of this term  ties the role of the physician to one that aids the patient in killing him or  herself.&nbsp; Implicit in the understanding  of the word suicide is the notion of a premature death that is being hastened  out of despair, therefore when mental illness impairs judgment, intervention to  stop a suicide is ethically warranted because the person seeking suicide has lost  his ability to carefully weigh the benefits and burdens of continued life.&nbsp; Generally speaking, persons who are suicidal  are treated as though their decision-making capacity is compromised and health  care providers often intervene and provide life-sustaining treatments (including  involuntary psychiatric treatment) over the objections of the patient. Some  people, including several national professional organizations*,  object to the term suicide because of the associations between suicide and  mental illness.&nbsp; They argue that, unlike  the patients with impaired judgment who request suicide, terminally ill  patients who request medication under the act have the capacity to make a rational,  autonomous decision to end their lives.
            <P> The  term &ldquo;physician aid-in-dying&rdquo; is used to describe the practice authorized under  the Washington and Oregon Death with Dignity Acts and is meant to reflect the  requirement that eligible persons must be decisionally competent and have a  limited life expectancy of about 6 months or less. &nbsp;In this context, the term is meant to reflect  that physicians provide assistance to patients who are otherwise going to die,  and who seek help to control the timing and circumstances of their death in the  face of end-of-life suffering they deem intolerable. &nbsp;While this term evades the mental health  connotations associated with the word suicide, people who object to the use of &ldquo;physician  aid in dying&rdquo; suggest that it could include other practices that are clearly  outside the legal bounds of Oregon&rsquo;s and Washington&rsquo;s Death with Dignity Act,  e.g. a patient who receives assistance in ingesting the medication, which would  constitute euthanasia (see below). Here we use the term physician aid-in-dying  to reflect the practice that is legal under the Washington Death with Dignity  Act.            
            <P> It  is important to note that both terms, &ldquo;physician assisted suicide&rdquo; and  &ldquo;physician aid-in-dying&rdquo; are value-laden and may reflect the speaker or writer&rsquo;s  political or ideological support for or objection to the practice.&nbsp; Recent research has detailed the need for  open and honest discussion on end of life issues.&nbsp; This discussion should supercede any debate  over the use of particular terms or language. Acknowledging the justification  behind the early terminology, as well as acknowledging the power of both  historic and contemporary terminology, will help flesh out both sides of this  sensitive and powerful debate.            
            <P> *The Oregon  Department of Public Health, American Public Health Association, American  Psychological Association, American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Care,  American Medical Women&rsquo;s Association, and the American Medical Student  Association have adopted the term patient directed dying or physician aid-in-dying  and have rejected the term physician-assisted suicide.<br>
            <P>              <a name="ques3"><strong>Is physician aid-in-dying (PAD) the same  as euthanasia?</strong></a><strong> </strong>            
            <P> No. While both physician aid-in-dying and euthanasia involve the  use of lethal medications to deliberately end a patient's life, the key  difference is in who acts to end the patient&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; In physician aid-in-dying, the patient must  self-administer the medications; the &quot;aid-in-dying&quot; refers to a  physician providing the medications, but the patient decides whether and when  to ingest the lethal medication. Euthanasia occurs when a third party  administers medication or acts directly to end the patient&rsquo;s life. Euthanasia  is illegal in every state, including Washington. 
            <p>&nbsp;Some other practices that  should be distinguished from physician aid-in-dying include: </p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li><strong><a href="termlife.html">Withholding/withdrawing       life-sustaining treatments</a>:</strong> When a competent patient makes an       informed decision to refuse life-sustaining treatment, there is virtual       unanimity in state law and in the medical profession that this wish should       be respected. </li>
              <li><strong>Pain       medication that may hasten death:</strong> Often a terminally ill, suffering       patient may require dosages of pain medication that have side effects that       may hasten death, such as impairing respiration. Using the ethical principle       of double effect as the foundational argument, it is generally held by       most professional societies, and supported in court decisions, that this       action is justifiable. Since the primary goal and intention of       administering these medications is to relieve suffering, the secondary outcome       of potentially hastening death is recognized as an expected and acceptable       side-effect.</li>
              <li><strong>Palliative       sedation:</strong> This refers to the practice of sedating a terminally ill patient to the       point of unconsciousness, due to intractable pain and suffering that has       been refractory to traditional medical management.&nbsp; Such patients are imminently dying,       usually hours or days from death.&nbsp;       Often other life-sustaining interventions continue to be withheld       (CPR, respirator, antibiotics, artificial nutrition and hydration, etc.)       while the patient is sedated.&nbsp; Palliative       sedation may occur for a short period (respite from intractable pain) or       the patient may be sedated until s/he dies.&nbsp; In the rare instances when pain and       suffering is refractory to treatment even with expert clinical management       by pain and palliative care professionals, palliative sedation may legally       be employed.<br>
              </li>
              </ul>
            <p><a name="ques4"><strong>Is physician aid-in-dying (PAD) ethically  permissible?</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
            <p>              The ethics of physician aid-in-dying continue to be debated. Some  argue that PAD is ethically permissible (see <a href="#ques5">arguments  in favor</a>). Often this is argued on the grounds that PAD may be a rational  choice for a dying person who is choosing to escape unbearable suffering at the  end of life. Furthermore, the physician's duty to alleviate suffering may, at  times, justify providing aid-in-dying. These arguments rely a great deal on respect  for individual autonomy, recognizing the right of competent people to choose  the timing and manner of death in the face of a terminal illness. </p>
            <p> Others  have argued that PAD is not ethically permissible because PAD runs directly  counter to the traditional duty of the physician to preserve life and to do no  harm (see <a href="#ques6">arguments  against</a>). Furthermore, many argue if PAD were legal, abuses would take  place, as the social forces that condone the practice are a slippery slope that  could lead to euthanasia. For instance, the disabled, poor or elderly might be  covertly pressured to choose PAD over more complex and expensive palliative  care options. </p>

            <p><a name="ques5"><strong>What are the arguments in favor of  physician aid-in-dying (PAD)?</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
            <p>              Those who argue that PAD is ethically justifiable offer the  following sorts of arguments: </p>
            <ol start="1" type="1">
              <li><strong>Respect for       autonomy:</strong> Decisions about time and circumstances of death are personal. Competent people       should have right to choose the timing and manner of death.&nbsp; </li>
              <li><strong>Justice:</strong> Justice       requires that we &quot;treat like cases alike.&quot; Competent, terminally       ill patients have the legal right to refuse treatment that will prolong       their deaths. For patients who are suffering but who are not dependent on       life support, such as respirators or dialysis, refusing treatment will not       suffice to hasten death quickly.&nbsp;       Thus, to treat these patients equitably, we should allow assisted       death as it is their only option to hasten death.</li>
              <li><strong>Compassion:</strong> Suffering       means more than pain; there are other physical, existential, social and       psychological burdens such as the loss of independence, loss of sense of       self, and functional capacities that some patients feel jeopardize their       dignity. It is not always possible to relieve suffering. Thus PAD may be a       compassionate response to unremitting suffering. </li>
              <li><strong>Individual       liberty vs. state interest</strong>: Though society has strong       interest in preserving life, that interest lessens when a person is       terminally ill and has strong desire to end life. A complete prohibition against       PAD excessively limits personal liberty. Therefore PAD should be allowed       in certain cases. </li>
              <li><strong>Honesty       &amp; Transparency:</strong> Some acknowledge that assisted death already       occurs, albeit in secret. The fact that PAD is illegal in most states prevents       open discussion, in which patients and physicians could engage.       Legalization of PAD would promote open discussion and may promote better       end-of-life care as patients and physicians could more directly address       concerns and options.<br>
              </li>
              </ol>
            <p><a name="ques6"><strong>What are the arguments against physician  aid-in-dying (PAD)?</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
            <p>              Those who argue that PAD is ethically impermissible often offer  arguments such as these: </p>
            <ol start="1" type="1">
              <li><strong>Sanctity of       life:</strong> Religious and secular traditions upholding the sanctity of human life have       historically prohibited suicide or assistance in dying. PAD is morally       wrong because it seems to diminish the sanctity of life.</li>
              <li><strong>Passive vs.       Active distinction:</strong> There is an important difference between       passively &quot;letting die&quot; and actively &quot;killing.&quot; Treatment       refusal or withholding treatment equates to letting die (passive) and is       justifiable, whereas PAD equates to killing (active) and is not       justifiable. </li>
              <li><strong>Potential       for abuse:</strong> Vulnerable populations, lacking access to quality care and support, may be       pushed into assisted death. Furthermore, assisted death may become a       cost-containment strategy. Burdened family members and health care       providers may encourage loved ones to opt for assisted death and the       protections in legislation can never catch all instances of such coercion       or exploitation. To protect against these abuses, PAD should remain       illegal. </li>
              <li><strong>Professional       integrity:</strong> Historical ethical traditions in medicine are strongly opposed to taking       life. For instance, the Hippocratic oath states, &quot;I will not       administer poison to anyone where asked,&quot; and I will &quot;be of       benefit, or at least do no harm.&quot; Furthermore, some major       professional groups (<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/Code_of_Med_Eth/opinion/opinion2211.html">American Medical Association</a>, <a href="http://www.americangeriatrics.org/products/positionpapers/vae94.shtml">American Geriatrics Society</a>) oppose       assisted death. The overall concern is that linking PAD to the practice of       medicine could harm both the integrity and the public's image of the profession. </li>
              <li><strong>Fallibility       of the profession:</strong> The concern is that physicians will make       mistakes. For instance there may be uncertainty in diagnosis and       prognosis. There may be errors in diagnosis and treatment of depression,       or inadequate treatment of pain. Thus the State has an obligation to       protect lives from these inevitable mistakes and to improve the quality of       pain and symptom management at the end of life.<strong><br>

            </ol>
            <p><a name="ques8"><strong>Is physician aid-in-dying (PAD) illegal?</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
            <p>Physician aid-in-dying is legal in Oregon and Washington,  where voter approved initiatives have legalized aid-in-dying  under very specific circumstances.&nbsp;  A Montana lower court has also determined that physician aid-in-dying is permitted under Montana's  State Constitution.&nbsp;  The Montana case is expected to be appealed to the  Montana State Supreme Court, but the lower court's  decision recognizing aid-in-dying remains in full force and effect.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In other states, without specific legislative  authority, or a court decision, physician aid-in-dying would most likely  be considered  illegal, and in many states is explicitly illegal.</p>
            <p> The  citizens of Oregon  passed Measure 16, the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, on November 16, 1994 by a  margin of 51.3% to 48.7%.&nbsp; Opponents  immediately challenged the law and it was not enacted.&nbsp; In response, the Oregon Legislature referred  Measure 51 (a law to repeal Measure 16) for a public vote.&nbsp; That measure was defeated by 60% of the votes  in 1997.&nbsp; Thus, physician-assisted dying  has been legal in the state of Oregon  since 1997.&nbsp; In November 2008, the  citizens of Washington  state passed I-1000, The Washington State Death with Dignity Act (DwDA) by a  margin of 57.8% to 42.2%, and it went into effect on March 5th, 2009.  (<a href="WDDA Fact Sheet 03-05-09.pdf">Click here</a> for  a link to a fact sheet on the Washington DwDA)</p>
            <p> In both  states, the Death with Dignity Act has strict patient eligibility criteria,  limiting access to competent, legal residents of the state over age 18, with a  terminal illness (defined as an estimated life expectancy of 6 months or less)  that is confirmed by two independent physicians. There is a requirement for two  oral requests with a 15-day waiting period in between, as well as a written  request that must be witnessed.&nbsp;  Prescriptions may be written no less than 48 hours after the receipt of  the written request. Patients must be able to self-administer the medications  (i.e., have the mental and physical capacity to take the medications on their  own). Providers may decline to prescribe medication under the Act. </p>
            <p> Several  major court decisions have been made regarding this issue. In the case of <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=96-110">Washington v. Glucksberg</a>, the plaintiffs  argued that prohibitions against suicide impinged on an individual&rsquo;s right to  liberty, as stated in the due process clause of the 14th  Amendment.&nbsp; The Ninth US Circuit Court of  Appeals upheld this argument, but this decision was later overturned by the  United States Supreme Court.&nbsp; In another  case, <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=95-1858">Vacco v. Quill</a>, the Second Circuit Court  found a New York  law on prohibiting assisted suicide was in conflict with the equal protections  clause of the 14th amendment, which says that no state shall &quot;deny to any  person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot; The  Court held that competent patients were being treated differently than  incompetent patients. The US Supreme Court declined to find a federal  constitutional right to &ldquo;assisted suicide&rdquo;, and made a legal distinction  between refusal of treatment and PAS. The Court also left the decision of  whether to legalize PAS up to each individual state. </p>
            <p> There  have several high-profile cases related to specific incidents of aid-in-dying.  The first was Dr. Timothy Quill (of Vacco v. Quill) who was investigated but not  indicted for his participation in the suicide of a patient after he published  his account of the incident. The second was Dr. Jack Kevorkian who claimed to  have assisted over 100 patients in death.&nbsp;  He was tried and acquitted for his role in the death of 3 persons.&nbsp; In November 1998, he and his patient, 52  year-old Thomas Youk, who suffered from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS&mdash;otherwise  known as Lou Gehrig's Disease) appeared on the TV show 60 Minutes where Dr.  Kevorkian administered a lethal injection. As a result of the show, Kevorkian  was tried for first degree murder in Oakland    County, Michigan.  Prosecutors argued that, in administering a lethal injection to Youk, his  actions constituted euthanasia rather than PAD. Kevorkian was convicted of  second degree murder in 1998, sentenced to a 15-25 year term of which he served  8 years, and was released in 2007.<br>

            <p>  <a name="ques9"><strong>What does the medical profession think  of physician aid-in-dying (PAD)?</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
            <p>              Surveys of individual physicians show that half believe that PAD  is ethically justifiable in certain cases (Cohen et al, 1994). However,  professional organizations such as the American Medical Association have  generally argued against PAD on the grounds that it undermines the integrity of  the profession. </p>
            <p> Surveys  of physicians in practice show that about 1 in 5 will receive a request for PAD  sometime in their career (Back et al, 1996; Meier et al, 1998). Qualitative research has shown that requests for PAD  bring up sensitive issues and emotions. Physicians stated that the discussion  around these issues took a large time investment and brought &nbsp;up patient and physician concerns about  depression, pain and symptom management, issues of control, and exploration of  the fear of abandonment (Back et al, 2001; Dobscha et al, 2004; Ganzini et al,  2000, 2001).<br>
            </p>
            <p>              <a name="ques10"><strong>What should I do if a  patient asks me for physician aid-in-dying (PAD)?</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
            <p> One of the most important aspects of responding to a request for  PAD is to be respectful and caring. Virtually every request represents a  profound event for the patient, who may have agonized over his situation. The  patient's request should be explored, to better understand its origin and to  determine if there are other interventions that may help ameliorate the motive  for the request. In states where PAD is illegal, it is important to evaluate  the reasons behind the request, because in most cases, there are alternatives  in palliative and hospice care that likely will address most of the patient&rsquo;s  concerns.&nbsp; Palliative care physicians recommend the following process for evaluating and  responding to requests (Emanuel 1998; Quill and Arnold 2008a, 2008b).</p>
            <ol start="1" type="1">
              <li>Wait to directly respond to       the request until you have explored the reasons for the patient&rsquo;s       request.&nbsp; Discuss various ways of       addressing the patient&rsquo;s pain, suffering, hopes, and fears.&nbsp; If time permits, tell the patient that       you would like to talk more about this at a subsequent appointment. That       gives both you and the patient time to prepare for a fuller exploration of       PAD as well as other palliative treatments, hospice, etc.</li>
              <li>Evaluate for depression or       other psychiatric conditions and treat appropriately.</li>
              <li>Assess the patient&rsquo;s decision-making       competence.</li>
              <li>Engage in discussion       surrounding the patient&rsquo;s diagnosis, prognosis, and goals for care. Make       sure to assess patient understanding.</li>
              <li>Evaluate patient&rsquo;s physical,       mental, social, and spiritual suffering. Be sure to take into account the       patient&rsquo;s support system as well as personal and professional pressures       and stressors.</li>
              <li>Discuss all alternative       options like palliative care and hospice.</li>
              <li>Consult with professional       colleagues regarding the patient&rsquo;s situation. Where appropriate, ask for       help from a palliative care specialist to assure that all options have       been explored.</li>
              <li>Help the patient complete       advance directives, DNR orders and POLST forms, as appropriate and ensure       that preferences are followed.<br>
                <br>
              </li>

            <p> If a patient's request for aid-in-dying persists, each individual  clinician must decide his or her own position and choose a course of action  that is ethically justifiable and legally permissible. It is useful to  carefully reflect on and think through where you stand on the issue and be  prepared to openly discuss your position with the patient, acknowledging and  respecting difference of opinion when it occurs. &nbsp;Patients who ask for PAD &ndash; in states where it  is legal or illegal &ndash; understand that physicians will have different opinions  about what they can and should do.&nbsp; The  most important thing is to be clear and transparent about your position.&nbsp; Even in states where it is illegal, some  physicians will decide to help their patients, particularly when patients are  enduring unbearable suffering.&nbsp; While we  cannot condone this practice, we must recognize its occurrence and the  reasoning behind it. No physician, however, should feel forced to provide assistance  if he or she is morally opposed to PAD.<br>
