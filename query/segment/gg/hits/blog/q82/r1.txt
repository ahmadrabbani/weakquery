For the purposes of ORS 127.005 to 127.045:        (1) “Agent” includes an attorney-in-fact; and        (2) “Financially incapable” has the meaning given that term in ORS 125.005. [2009 c.46 §1]            127.005 When power of attorney in effect; accounting to conservator.   (1) When a principal designates another person as an agent by a power of attorney in writing, and the power of attorney does not contain words that otherwise delay or limit the period of time of its effectiveness:        (a) The power of attorney becomes effective when executed and remains in effect until the power is revoked by the principal;        (b) The powers of the agent are unaffected by the passage of time; and        (c) The powers of the agent are exercisable by the agent on behalf of the principal even though the principal becomes financially incapable.        (2) The terms of a power of attorney may provide that the power of attorney will become effective at a specified future time, or will become effective upon the occurrence of a specified future event or contingency such as the principal becoming financially incapable. If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the occurrence of a specified future event or contingency, the power of attorney may designate a person or persons to determine whether the specified event or contingency has occurred, and the manner in which the determination must be made. A person designated by a power of attorney to determine whether the principal is financially incapable is the principal’s personal representative for the purposes of ORS 192.518 to 192.529 and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act privacy regulations, 45 C.F.R. parts 160 and 164.        (3) If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the principal becoming financially incapable and either the power of attorney does not designate a person or persons to make the determination as to whether the principal is financially incapable or none of the designated persons is willing or able to make the determination, a determination that the principal is financially incapable may be made by any physician. The physician’s determination must be made in writing.        (4) All acts done by an agent under a power of attorney during a period in which the principal is financially incapable have the same effect, and inure to the benefit of and bind the principal, as though the principal were not financially incapable.        (5) If a conservator is appointed for a principal, the agent shall account to the conservator, rather than to the principal, for so long as the conservatorship lasts. The conservator has the same power that the principal would have to revoke, suspend or terminate all or any part of the power of attorney.        (6) This section does not apply to powers of attorney for health care executed under ORS 127.505 to 127.660 and 127.995. [Formerly 126.407; 1993 c.767 §25; 2001 c.395 §4; 2009 c.46 §2]            127.010   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.015 Power of attorney not revoked until death or other event known.   (1) The death of a principal who has executed a power of attorney in writing, or the occurrence of any other event that would otherwise terminate the authority of the agent, does not revoke or terminate the authority of an agent who, without actual knowledge of the death of the principal or other event, acts in good faith under the power of attorney. Any action so taken, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and heirs, devisees and personal representatives of the principal.        (2) An affidavit executed by an agent that states that the agent did not have, at the time of doing an act under the power of attorney, actual knowledge of the revocation or termination of the power of attorney by death or other event, is, in the absence of fraud, conclusive proof of the nonrevocation or nontermination of the power at that time. If the exercise of the power requires execution and delivery of any instrument that is recordable, the affidavit may also be recorded.        (3) This section does not alter or affect any provision for revocation or termination contained in the power of attorney. [Formerly 126.413; 2009 c.46 §3]            127.020   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.025 Authority under power of attorney recognizable regardless of date of execution.   A person may not refuse to recognize the authority of an agent under a power of attorney based solely on the passage of time since the power of attorney was executed. [2001 c.395 §1; 2009 c.46 §4]            127.030   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.035 Limitations on liability of person reasonably relying on power of attorney.   Any person who reasonably relies in good faith on the authority of an agent under a power of attorney is not liable to any other person based on that reliance, and is not required to ensure that assets of the principal that are paid or delivered to the agent are properly applied. Any person who has not received actual notice of revocation of a power of attorney is not liable to any other person by reason of relying on a power of attorney that has been revoked. [2001 c.395 §2; 2009 c.46 §5]            127.040   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.045 Duty of agent under power of attorney.   Unless otherwise provided in the power of attorney document, an agent must use the property of the principal for the benefit of the principal. [2001 c.395 §3; 2009 c.46 §6]            127.050   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.060   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.070   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.080   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.090   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.100   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.110   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.120   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.130   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.140   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.150   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.160   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.170   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.180   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.190   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.310   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.320   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.330   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.340   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]            127.350   [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]     ADVANCE DIRECTIVES FOR HEALTH CARE     (Definitions)            127.505 Definitions for ORS 127.505 to 127.660.

It creates a declaration for mental health treatment. Before signing this document, you should know these important facts:        This document allows you to make decisions in advance about certain types of mental health treatment: psychoactive medication, short-term (not to exceed 17 days) admission to a treatment facility, convulsive treatment and outpatient services. Outpatient services are mental health services provided by appointment by licensed professionals and programs. The instructions that you include in this declaration will be followed only if a court or two physicians believe that you are incapable of making treatment decisions. Otherwise, you will be considered capable to give or withhold consent for the treatments. Your instructions may be overridden if you are being held pursuant to civil commitment law.        You may also appoint a person as your representative to make treatment decisions for you if you become incapable. The person you appoint has a duty to act consistently with your desires as stated in this document or, if not stated, as otherwise known by the representative. If your representative does not know your desires, he or she must make decisions in your best interests. For the appointment to be effective, the person you appoint must accept the appointment in writing. The person also has the right to withdraw from acting as your representative at any time. A “representative” is also referred to as an “attorney-in-fact” in state law but this person does not need to be an attorney at law.        This document will continue in effect for a period of three years unless you become incapable of participating in mental health treatment decisions. If this occurs, the directive will continue in effect until you are no longer incapable.        You have the right to revoke this document in whole or in part at any time you have not been determined to be incapable. YOU MAY NOT REVOKE THIS DECLARATION WHEN YOU ARE CONSIDERED INCAPABLE BY A COURT OR TWO PHYSICIANS. A revocation is effective when it is communicated to your attending physician or other provider.        If there is anything in this document that you do not understand, you should ask a lawyer to explain it to you. This declaration will not be valid unless it is signed by two qualified witnesses who are personally known to you and who are present when you sign or acknowledge your signature.  NOTICE TO PHYSICIAN OR PROVIDER        Under Oregon law, a person may use this declaration to provide consent for mental health treatment or to appoint a representative to make mental health treatment decisions when the person is incapable of making those decisions. A person is “incapable” when, in the opinion of a court or two physicians, the person’s ability to receive and evaluate information effectively or communicate decisions is impaired to such an extent that the person currently lacks the capacity to make mental health treatment decisions. This document becomes operative when it is delivered to the person’s physician or other provider and remains valid until revoked or expired. Upon being presented with this declaration, a physician or provider must make it a part of the person’s medical record. When acting under authority of the declaration, a physician or provider must comply with it to the fullest extent possible. If the physician or provider is unwilling to comply with the declaration, the physician or provider may withdraw from providing treatment consistent with professional judgment and must promptly notify the person and the person’s representative and document the notification in the person’s medical record. A physician or provider who administers or does not administer mental health treatment according to and in good faith reliance upon the validity of this declaration is not subject to criminal prosecution, civil liability or professional disciplinary action resulting from a subsequent finding of the declaration’s invalidity.  ______________________________________________________________________________     [1997 c.563 §3 (enacted in lieu of 127.735)]            127.737 Certain other laws applicable to declaration.

[1995 c.3 §3.12]            127.875 §3.13. Insurance or annuity policies.   The sale, procurement, or issuance of any life, health, or accident insurance or annuity policy or the rate charged for any policy shall not be conditioned upon or affected by the making or rescinding of a request, by a person, for medication to end his or her life in a humane and dignified manner. Neither shall a qualified patient’s act of ingesting medication to end his or her life in a humane and dignified manner have an effect upon a life, health, or accident insurance or annuity policy.

Nothing in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 shall be construed to authorize a physician or any other person to end a patient’s life by lethal injection, mercy killing or active euthanasia. Actions taken in accordance with ORS 127.800 to 127.897 shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide, assisted suicide, mercy killing or homicide, under the law.

Except as provided in ORS 127.890:        (1) No person shall be subject to civil or criminal liability or professional disciplinary action for participating in good faith compliance with ORS 127.800 to 127.897. This includes being present when a qualified patient takes the prescribed medication to end his or her life in a humane and dignified manner.        (2) No professional organization or association, or health care provider, may subject a person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license, loss of privileges, loss of membership or other penalty for participating or refusing to participate in good faith compliance with ORS 127.800 to 127.897.        (3) No request by a patient for or provision by an attending physician of medication in good faith compliance with the provisions of ORS 127.800 to 127.897 shall constitute neglect for any purpose of law or provide the sole basis for the appointment of a guardian or conservator.        (4) No health care provider shall be under any duty, whether by contract, by statute or by any other legal requirement to participate in the provision to a qualified patient of medication to end his or her life in a humane and dignified manner. If a health care provider is unable or unwilling to carry out a patient’s request under ORS 127.800 to 127.897, and the patient transfers his or her care to a new health care provider, the prior health care provider shall transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient’s relevant medical records to the new health care provider.        (5)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a health care provider may prohibit another health care provider from participating in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 on the premises of the prohibiting provider if the prohibiting provider has notified the health care provider of the prohibiting provider’s policy regarding participating in ORS 127.800 to 127.897. Nothing in this paragraph prevents a health care provider from providing health care services to a patient that do not constitute participation in ORS 127.800 to 127.897.        (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) to (4) of this section, a health care provider may subject another health care provider to the sanctions stated in this paragraph if the sanctioning health care provider has notified the sanctioned provider prior to participation in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 that it prohibits participation in ORS 127.800 to 127.897:        (A) Loss of privileges, loss of membership or other sanction provided pursuant to the medical staff bylaws, policies and procedures of the sanctioning health care provider if the sanctioned provider is a member of the sanctioning provider’s medical staff and participates in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 while on the health care facility premises, as defined in ORS 442.015, of the sanctioning health care provider, but not including the private medical office of a physician or other provider;        (B) Termination of lease or other property contract or other nonmonetary remedies provided by lease contract, not including loss or restriction of medical staff privileges or exclusion from a provider panel, if the sanctioned provider participates in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 while on the premises of the sanctioning health care provider or on property that is owned by or under the direct control of the sanctioning health care provider; or        (C) Termination of contract or other nonmonetary remedies provided by contract if the sanctioned provider participates in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 while acting in the course and scope of the sanctioned provider’s capacity as an employee or independent contractor of the sanctioning health care provider. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to prevent:        (i) A health care provider from participating in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 while acting outside the course and scope of the provider’s capacity as an employee or independent contractor; or        (ii) A patient from contracting with his or her attending physician and consulting physician to act outside the course and scope of the provider’s capacity as an employee or independent contractor of the sanctioning health care provider.        (c) A health care provider that imposes sanctions pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection must follow all due process and other procedures the sanctioning health care provider may have that are related to the imposition of sanctions on another health care provider.        (d) For purposes of this subsection:        (A) “Notify” means a separate statement in writing to the health care provider specifically informing the health care provider prior to the provider’s participation in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 of the sanctioning health care provider’s policy about participation in activities covered by ORS 127.800 to 127.897.        (B) “Participate in ORS 127.800 to 127.897” means to perform the duties of an attending physician pursuant to ORS 127.815, the consulting physician function pursuant to ORS 127.820 or the counseling function pursuant to ORS 127.825. “Participate in ORS 127.800 to 127.897” does not include:        (i) Making an initial determination that a patient has a terminal disease and informing the patient of the medical prognosis;        (ii) Providing information about the Oregon Death with Dignity Act to a patient upon the request of the patient;        (iii) Providing a patient, upon the request of the patient, with a referral to another physician; or        (iv) A patient contracting with his or her attending physician and consulting physician to act outside of the course and scope of the provider’s capacity as an employee or independent contractor of the sanctioning health care provider.        (6) Suspension or termination of staff membership or privileges under subsection (5) of this section is not reportable under ORS 441.820. Action taken pursuant to ORS 127.810, 127.815, 127.820 or 127.825 shall not be the sole basis for a report of unprofessional or dishonorable conduct under ORS 677.415 (3), (4), (5) or (6).        (7) No provision of ORS 127.800 to 127.897 shall be construed to allow a lower standard of care for patients in the community where the patient is treated or a similar community.

Liabilities.   (1) A person who without authorization of the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication or conceals or destroys a rescission of that request with the intent or effect of causing the patient’s death shall be guilty of a Class A felony.        (2) A person who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request medication for the purpose of ending the patient’s life, or to destroy a rescission of such a request, shall be guilty of a Class A felony.        (3) Nothing in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 limits further liability for civil damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional misconduct by any person.        (4) The penalties in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 do not preclude criminal penalties applicable under other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions of ORS 127.800 to 127.897. [1995 c.3 §4.02]            127.892 Claims by governmental entity for costs incurred.
