<h2>Oregon Voters Uphold "Death With

Dignity Act" - The Effect on End-of-Life Care Is Unknown<br>

by Janet Heald Forlini, J.D.</h2>



In November, 1997, Oregon voters decided by an overwhelming majority (60%)

to keep physician-assisted suicide legal. Voters originally supported the 1994

Oregon Death With Dignity Act by a 3% margin. Opponents had prevented the law

from taking effect through court challenges and temporary injunctions.<p>



According to Oregon leaders, legislators based their decision to hold a

referendum after hearing Dutch statistics that one out of every four patients

who request lethal medication die a lingering, bad death. Voter rationale on

supporting the issue may have come from anger that their original vote was not

seen as decisive.<p>



The June Supreme Court decision emphatically stated that this issue was to

be determined at the state level. Thus, There appeared to be no federal

barriers to law until November 8, when the U.S. DEA issued a statement noting

that Oregon's law would cause physicians to violate federal narcotics laws. A

DEA Administrator commented that prescribing a controlled substance with the

intent to cause death was not a "legitimate medical purpose," as

required by federal law.<p>



According to reports in <i>The Oregonian</i>, supporters of the law vowed to

sue if the DEA moves forward with its threats. One Oregon attorney commented

that the fact that voters had approved the law brings it under the

"legitimate medical purpose" of the law.<p>



Before anyone can be sure of the effect of the DEA's threats, advocates will

need to see what moves are made by parties on both sides of this contentious

debate. Regardless of one's position, concerns about putting the law into

practice should be a predominant issue. Will the statutory safeguards be

workable?<p>



Some experts are concerned about the "terminal illness" requirement

of the statute. Does that category apply only to patients who will most

certainly die without treatment? Should such a wide range of individuals have

the option of assisted suicide?<p>



At this point, we can all try to act cautiously and

carefully in the wake of the Oregon vote. We should press for careful

monitoring and measurement of the changed practices and their effect. Oregon's

voters have spoken. We must do our best to ensure that the practice for which

they voted occurs carefully and within the parameters of the law.<p>
