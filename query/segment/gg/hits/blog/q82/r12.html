<p><b><a name="Q1"></a>1.  What is physician-assisted suicide (called by supporters "Death With
    Dignity")?</b></p>
<p>The Oregon "Death With Dignity" law (and the proposed Vermont bill) allows
  a patient's physician to write a lethal prescription for a competent patient
  who has less than 6 months to live if the patient is competent, not depressed,
  and not coerced.  The law requires that the patient self-administer the lethal
  drug.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Return to top.</a></p>
<hr />

<p><b><a name="Q2"></a>2.  Is the proposed "Death With Dignity" suicide or not?</b></p>
<p>Proponents of this bill prefer to call it "death with dignity" or "physician
  aid-in-dying" or "hastening death" or "an end-of-life choice".  They get inordinately
  upset when opponents call it "physician-assisted suicide".</p>
<p>AN ACT RELATING TO THE VERMONT DEATH WITH DIGNITY ACT ---------First sentence
  of the bill:  "Statement of purpose:  This bill proposes to allow a mentally
  competent patient who is expected to die within six months to end his or her
  life in a humane and dignified manner by prescription medication."  Last sentence
  of the bill:  "Action taken in accordance with this act shall not be construed
  for any purpose to constitute suicide, assisted suicide, mercy killing, or
  homicide under the law."</p>
<p><i><u>Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</u>:</i><b>  Sui-cide:  </b><i>noun</i>  Etymology:
  Latin <i>sui </i>(general) of oneself + English <i>-cide; </i>akin to Old English &amp; Old
  High German <i>sIn </i>his, Latin <i>suus </i>one's own, <i>sed, se </i>without,
  Sanskrit <i>sva </i>oneself, one's own<br>
      <b>1 a</b> <b>:</b> the act or an instance of taking one's own life voluntarily
      and intentionally especially by a person of years of discretion and of
      sound mind</p>
<p>Bishop Kenneth Angell issued the following statement on Vermont's "Death With Dignity" proposal (January
  30, 2003) "The Oregon Death with Dignity Act is based on a moral lie that even
  Webster's dictionary exposes.  Suicide is simply defined as "the intentional
  taking of one's own life."  The legislators and people of Oregon have rewritten
  the definition of suicide to soothe their social conscience.  The Oregon Death
  with Dignity Act attempts to exonerate and absolve the patient from the sin
  of suicide.  By filling out the proper forms this law says a person will not
  be committing an act of suicide when they take their own lives with medication
  furnished by their physician.  Furthermore, the doctor has been declared innocent
  of assisting in the patient's suicide, even though he has completely facilitated
  his patient's suicide with forms and furnishing of the death pills.  But the
  law says it is not suicide.  The law says it is death with dignity, and that
  the doctor is not aiding a suicide.  There is nothing sadder or more injurious
  to our ethical balance than when we lie to ourselves."  Most Reverend Kenneth
  A. Angell, Bishop of Burlington</p>

<p><b><a name="Q3"></a>3.  What is the public's opinion on physician-assisted suicide?</b></p>
<p>Public opinion polls are an important tool in making decisions on public policy.  However,
  poll results often reflect a person's first impression, not necessarily his
  or her thoughtful belief.  For example, Oregon polls on physician-assisted
  suicide done just before the referendum vote in 1994 showed 60-70% support,
  but the actual referendum passed 51.3% to 48.7%.  In addition, poll results
  are greatly influenced by the way the poll question is worded.  For example,
  one poll found that 72% favored allowing a physician to "end the patient's
  life by some painless means", but only 62% favored allowing the physician to "assist
  the patient to commit suicide."  With those caveats, let's look at some actual
  poll results, both national and in Vermont.</p>

<p><b><a name="Q5"></a>5.  Does legalization of physician-assisted suicide improve the quality
    of end-of-life care?</b></p>
<p>Oregon has widespread availability and high utilization
  rates for hospice services.  Their advances in hospice/end-of-life care began
  in 1990, but the law allowing physician-assisted suicide didn't go into effect
  until 1997.  Supporters of legalization of physician-assisted suicide in Vermont
  suggest that if our state legalizes PAS, our utilization of hospice services
  and quality of end-of-life care will improve.  However, some research data
  raises significant questions about this assertion.</p>
<p>"If we want to improve Vermont's end-of-life care,
  we would do well to imitate those who have already achieved the goal we seek.  The
  model for this effort is Oregon."  James Brooks, Barre, in letter to editor,
  June 11, 2004</p>
<p>"Increased Family Reports of Pain or Distress in
  Dying Oregonians:  1996-2002" by Erik Fromme, MD; Virginia Tilden, RN, Linda
  Drach, MPH, Susan Tolle, MD (Oregon Health Sciences University and Oregon Department
  of Human Services).  <i>Journal of Palliative Medicine</i> 2004; volume 7,
  Number 3; pages 431-442</p>
<p>Abstract:  "The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of family-reported
  pain or distress during the last week of decedents' lives during two times:  November
  1996 to December 1997 and June 2000 to March 2002. [note:  physician-assisted
  suicide became legally available in Oregon in late 1997.]  We telephone-surveyed
  family caregivers of Oregonians who had died 2 to 5 months previously in private
  homes, nursing homes, and other community-based settings.  Caregivers were
  asked to rate the level of pain or distress during the decedent's final week
  of life on a four-point scale.  Data were collected from 340 respondents from
  1996-1997 and 1384 respondents from 2000-2002.  We found that the prevalence
  of family-reported moderate or severe pain or distress (compared to comfortable
  or mild pain or distress) in Oregon decedents <b><u>increased from 30.8% in
  1996-1997 to 48% in 2000-2000.</u></b>"  [emphasis added]</p>

<p><b><a name="Q6"></a>6.  Have the safeguards included in the Oregon law allowing physician-assisted
    suicide worked to protect vulnerable patients from abuse or expansion of
    the criteria?</b></p>
<p>No. The cases below show that Oregon's Physician-Assisted Suicide Law is abused and exploited.</p>
<h2>Case in Point:  Michael Freeland</h2>
<p>The safeguards failed to protect Michael Freeland:</p>
<ul>
  <li>	Incorrect prognosis &ndash; Michael Freeland was not within six months of dying</li>
  <li>The prescribing doctor offered a lethal prescription to a depressed patient</li>
  <li>Even after courts determined that Michael Freeland was not competent and in need of a guardian, he was allowed to keep his lethal prescription</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Case in Point:  Patrick Matheny</h2>
<p>  The safeguards failed in the Patrick Matheny case:</p>
<ul>
  <li>	Patients are required by law to self-administer the lethal drug in order to protect them from coercion and foul play.</li>
  <li>No investigation was done in the Matheny case, even though a violation of the law was reported in the newspapers, sending the signal that Oregon&rsquo;s Death with Dignity Act can be violated with impunity.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Case in Point:  David Pruitt</h2>
David Pruitt, a man from Oregon with lung cancer, obtained from a physician the standard lethal prescription, and when he felt it was time, he took the entire amount. He went to sleep for 65 hours and woke up saying &ldquo;What the hell happened? Why am I not dead?&rdquo; He was so unnerved by the experience that he didn&rsquo;t want to go through it again. He died naturally about two weeks later.
<h2> Case in Point:  Kate Cheney</h2>
<p>It is possible to circumvent the safeguards by &quot;shopping&quot; for an agreeable professional if the patient or family disagree with these professional opinions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>By giving the interview, the patient's daughter unintentionally revealed that the law does not adequately protect patients with diminished capacity from family coercion.</li>
  <li>Did financial considerations influence the HMO director to write the prescription?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Case in Point: The Patient of Dr. Charles Bentz</h2>
<p>The safeguards failed this patient:</p>
<ul>
  <li>His well-documented depression was not evaluated by a mental health specialist, nor was it treated.</li>
  <li>His primary physician was excluded from helping him with his end-of-life concerns.</li>
  <li>His oncologist falsified a public document by lying about the cause of death.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Case in Point:  Helen X</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Physician refusal to write a lethal prescription because the requesting patient does not meet the legal criteria need not deter a patient who is eager to die. All she needs to do is keep asking until she finds someone willing.</li>
  <li>This is not &quot;protection.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Case in Point:  Barbara Houck</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It is very unusual for an oncologist to evaluate and make a prognosis for a patient with an uncommon neurologic disease.</li>
  <li>The legally required prognosis of &quot;less than 6 months to live&quot; is in doubt.</li>
  <li>The law requires the patient to self-administer the lethal drug.  This patient received significant help from her physician and her sons.</li>
  <li>The &quot;safeguards&quot; did not work for this patient.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Case in Point:  Clarietta Day</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Dr. Gallant's lethal injection was clearly illegal.</li>
  <li>Was he motivated to do this by pending new legislation that would allow doctors to hasten death?</li>
  <li>Would this incident have been reported in the official PAS statistics had it happened a few months later?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Further Information on Selected Cases</h2>
<p><strong> Michael Freeland</strong> requested and received a lethal prescription from
  Dr. Peter Reagan, a suicide advocate, a few months after being diagnosed with
  lung cancer.  Dr. Reagan offered to refill it when he outlived his 6 month
  limit.  </p>
<p>Over a year after receiving the first prescription, he was admitted to a psychiatric
  treatment facility with depression and suicidal intent.  He was treated and
  improved.  His professional caregivers ensured that all of his 32 guns and
  ammunition were removed from his home before he was allowed to return, but
  they knowingly allowed him to keep his lethal prescription.  His treating psychiatrist
  wrote a letter to the court the day after his discharge saying he was not competent
  and needed a guardian.</p>
<p>Mr. Freeland called Physicians for Compassionate Care (he called them accidentally;
  he was actually trying to contact the suicide advocacy organization Compassion
  in Dying).  PCC volunteers helped him through his last several months of life,
  saw that his depression and his symptoms were treated appropriately, and assisted
  him in reconciling with his estranged daughter.  He died naturally and comfortably
  nearly 2 years after receiving his first lethal prescription.  Before he died,
  he signed an authorization releasing his medical records for public review.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Lethal prescription obtained from a suicide
  advocate rather than own physician.</li>
  <li>Patient with severe depression, allowed to
    keep his lethal prescription.</li>
  <li>"Incompetent" patient allowed to keep his
    lethal prescription.</li>
  <li>Major error in prognosis.</li>
  <li>Good palliative care shown to have great benefit
    for dying man.</li>
</ul>

    Standard</i>  5/17/04; 9(34)</p>
<p>Hamilton NG, Hamilton C.  Competing paradigms of responding to assisted suicide
  requests in Oregon:  Case report.  Presented at the American Psychiatric Association
  Annual Meeting in New York City, 5/6/04</p>
<p><strong> Kate Cheney</strong>, 85, had terminal cancer and told her doctor
  she wanted assisted suicide,  However, he was concerned that didn't meet the
  required criteria for mental competence because of dementia.  So he declined
  to write the requested prescription and instead  referred her to a psychiatrist
  as required by law.  She was accompanied to the psychiatric consultation by
  her daughter, Erika Goldstein.  The psychiatrist found that Kate had a loss
  of short-term memory.  It also appeared that her daughter had more interest
  in Cheney's assisted suicide than did the patient herself.  The psychiatrist
  wrote in his report that while the assisted suicide seemed consistent with
  Kate's values, &quot;she does not seem to be explicitly pushing for this.&quot;  He
  also determined that Kate did not have the &quot;very high capacity required
  to weigh options about assisted suicide.&quot;  Accordingly, he declined to
  authorize the lethal prescription.</p>
<p>Kate seemed to accept the psychiatrist's verdict, but her daughter did not.  Ms.
  Goldstein viewed the guidelines protecting her mother's life as obstacles,
  a &quot;roadblock&quot; to Kate's right to die.  Ms. Goldstein demanded that
  Kate's HMO, Kaiser Permanente, provider a second opinion.  This was provided
  by a clinical psychologist rather than a MD-psychiatrist.  He also found Kate
  had memory problems.  For example, she could not recall when she had been diagnosed
  with terminal cancer.  The psychologist also worried about familial pressure,
  writing that Kate's decision to die &quot;may be influenced by her family's
  wishes.&quot;  Still, despite these reservations, the psychologist determined
  that Kate was competent to kill herself and approved the writing of the lethal
  prescription.</p>
<p>The final decision about the assisted suicide was left to a Kaiser physician-administrator
  named Dr. Robert Richardson.  He interviewed Kate, and she told him she wanted
  the pills not because she was in irremediable pain but because she feared not
  being able to attend to her personal hygiene.  After the interview, satisfied
  that Kate was competent, Richardson gave the okay for the lethal prescription.</p>
<p>Kate didn't take the pills right away.  At one point, she asked to die when
  her daughter had to help her shower after an accident with her colostomy bag,
  but she quickly changed her mind.  Then, she went into a nursing home for a
  week so that her family could have some respite from care giving.  After she
  returned home, she declared her desire to take the pills.  After grandchildren
  said their good-byes, Kate took the lethal drug.  She died with her daughter
  at her side, telling her what a courageous woman she was.</p>
<p>Deviations from the letter and/or intent of the law:</p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li>The procedure is in place to act as a safeguard, (1) to protect vulnerable
    patients without decision-making capacity; (2) to protect patients from family
    pressure.  Both of these safeguards failed in this case.</li>
  <li>The procedure of safeguards might have worked since both her physician
    and the consulting psychiatrist felt she lacked the required level of decision-making
    capacity.  However, it is possible to circumvent the safeguards by "shopping" for
    an agreeable professional if the patient or family disagree with these professional
    opinions.</li>
  <li>This patient's daughter talked with the newspaper specifically because
    she found the "cumbersome" procedure was "an obstacle" to her desires.  By
    giving the interview, the patient's daughter unintentionally revealed that
    the law does not adequately protect patients with diminished capacity from
    family coercion. </li>
  <li>Did financial considerations influence the HMO director to write the prescription?</li>

<p class=DefinitionList><strong> Patrick Matheny</strong>, 43, had Lou Gehrig's
  disease (ALS).  For several months, he struggled with a decision to end his
  life using a lethal prescription.  He would set arbitrary deadlines, then,
  when the time came, would set new deadlines. At first, it was to be after his
  15-year-old son came to visit last Thanksgiving. Then it was to be when he
  could no longer dress and wash himself.  As an article in the Oregonian put
  it, &quot;Pat felt he would rather be dead than accept help to bathe and dress.&quot; But
  when the time came, he was able to handle having his mother and hospice nurses
  help him-so he set new deadlines.</p>
<p class=DefinitionList>On 3/10/99, Matheny tried to swallow the barbiturates
  mixed into a chocolate nutrition drink, sweetened with a boxful of sugar substitute.  Reportedly,
  he experienced difficulty swallowing the concoction. The only person Methany
  had asked to be with him in his trailer was his brother-in-law, Joe Hayes.  Hayes
  told the <i>Oregonian</i> that he had to &quot;help&quot; Matheny to die, but
  would not say how.  According to Hayes, it was too personal. &quot;It doesn't
  go smoothly for everyone,&quot; Hayes explained. &quot;For Pat it was a huge
  problem. It would have not worked without help,&quot; he added.</p>
<p class=DefinitionList>Coos County District Attorney Paul Burgett called for
  an investigation of Matheny's death after reading Hayes' comments in the <i>Oregonian</i>.  His
  body had been cremated, so was not available for examination.  Burgett then
  quickly dropped the inquiry, saying, &quot;We think the purpose of the law
  was served and we have no further questions.&quot;  The county investigator
  did not question Hayes at all, yet Burgett told reporters that he was satisfied
  that Hayes simply assisted Matheny in a legal act which Matheny intended to
  commit.  He went on to say he thought disabled people who cannot swallow should
  have an equal right to assisted suicide as long as they meet the requirements
  of the law.</p>
<p class=DefinitionList>After reading Burgett's comments, State Senator Neil
  Bryant asked Deputy Attorney General Schuman for his opinion. &quot;The Death
  with Dignity Act does not, on its face and in so many words, discriminate against
  persons who are unable to self-administer medication.  Nonetheless, it would
  have that effect,&quot; Schuman wrote. &quot;It therefore seems logical to
  conclude that persons who are unable to self-medicate will be denied access
  to a 'death with dignity' in disproportionate numbers,&quot; he added.</p>
<p class=DefinitionList>Deviations from the letter and/or intent of the law:</p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li>Patients are required to self-administer the lethal drug</li>
  <li>Deputy Attorney General says law is too restrictive and should be expanded.</li>
