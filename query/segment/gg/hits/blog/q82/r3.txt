He went online and posted the news: " On Tuesday I'll finally end my battle with cancer thanks to Oregon's Death with dignity act ." Calling himself "Lucidending," he told the world to ask him anything.  More than 9,000 people responded Saturday night on the social networking site reddit.com. They shared personal stories, uploaded photos and videos, and asked questions about death and dying.  But one of Lucidending's statements suggests he may not be someone who has received a prescription to hasten death under Oregon's law. When asked about the details of a lethal prescription, Lucidending indicated he would take the drug intravenously, which is not allowed under the Oregon law.  "I'm given medication by the doctor to self administer. I already have the iv so it should be easy," he said.  Under  Oregon's Death with Dignity Act , the patient must be able to self ingest the medication by swallowing or taking it through a feeding tube if that is their established way of eating. The law does not allow intravenous injections. Lucidending did not respond to personal messages sent Monday.  Authentic or not, the story triggered an immense outpouring of empathy and attempts to comfort a dying man with hours to live. Someone with the online name Honkytonk recorded and uploaded a guitar song. Well-wishers from as far away as Hong Kong, India, Japan and New Zealand joined the conversation. Lucidending responded for about an hour then went silent.  Compassion & Choices of Oregon , an advocacy group that each year works with many of the terminally ill people who use the Oregon law, declined to comment on Lucidending's story. A spokesman said the group is not in contact with any patients who are preparing to use a prescription this week.  Reddit  community manager Erik Martin said the company doesn't attempt to verify the stories of social networking participants who choose to post anonymously. He noted that Lucidending's post is the third most popular since reddit.com started its "IAmA" forum a year ago.  Oregon officials have recorded 525 deaths by patients ingesting medications prescribed under Oregon's Death with Dignity Act since it took effect in 1997. Last year physicians wrote 96 prescriptions for lethal medications and 65 patients used a prescription to hasten death. About 70 percent were over age 65, and a majority had cancer.  -- Joe Rojas-Burke       Related topics:  lucidending ,  oregon death with dignity ,  reddit.com         Sponsored Links                  Share this story                Print  Email  Story tools              More stories in Health & Fitness News    Previous story Health test: How safe is indoor tanning?

It's far more trollish to go around downvoting and disagreeing with people because you assume they're trolling. Besides, Reddit has a whole set of guidelines, called 'reddiquette", which discourage from downvoting at all except to moderate posts that "contribute nothing to the discussion". Even a troll contributes to the discussion, unless they're just totally off-topic. He's right, they should just get rid of the downvote button, it gets abused far too often and ends up hurting the quality of content.  Inappropriate?  Alert us.

If so, did you really e-mail a dying man, one day before his death, to question his story, simply so you could publish your own article in case he was lying?  I won't take a stance on the verity of his story, but if he wasn't lying, isn't it at least a bit selfish to message him about his death one day before the fateful event? Even if he was lying, was the risk worth taking?  Inappropriate?  Alert us.  Reply  Post new         tao4mind   March 07, 2011 at 11:22PM  Follow    Just a coincidence that Barbara Coombs Lee the President, Compassion & Choices is with U.S. House of Representatives (D-OR), Michael Cannon, for a big political conferance on March 8, 2011, in Washington, DC, where the focus of the panel will discuss the implications of these critical life choices for families, the medical community, and national health care policy. To me "in my opinion" this Lucidending story was a form of communication that is aimed at influencing the attitude of a community toward someones personal cause or position, the systematic propagation of a doctrine of information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such a doctrine or cause. It reminded me of political speaches, what I call "Nursed and Rehursted" ideologies. What power could cause him to boast of an attainment he has not attained and allow others to boast for him?

Reply  Post new         funknut   March 08, 2011 at 12:53PM  Follow    Mr. Rojas-Burke,  You seem to be relying on a red herring that IV ingestion is not allowed under the DWDA. There is no language in the act that says anything about self-administered injections. The only language in the act that comes close is the part about injection is section "127.880 s.3.14. Construction of Act" which reads "Nothing in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 shall be construed to authorize a physician or any other person to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing or active euthanasia." This does not include self-administered injections. If we are to accept Lucidending's claim that he will indeed receive medication which would be injected into his IV, we can infer that he will receive a vial of phenobarbitol, which he must, himself, draw into a syringe and inject into his IV picc line, a process which he would be very familiar with after his treatment for lymphoma.  The main unbelievable problem with the story is that he stopped posting after an hour and never posted the YouTube video that he mentioned, although he never actually suggested he would stick around to continue discussion, or that he wasn't making the video for a private audience (e.g. family). This is common with hit and run trolls on Reddit. Reddit is rampant with trolls who create false situations to sensationalize a personal belief, sometimes just to evoke an emotion in people, and sometimes just to innocently incite an interesting discussion. Whether Lucidending's posts were "trolls", or not, we may never know. One thing is highly probable, if it is a troll, Reddit very likely knows, but withholds the information from its users to maintain its reputation of being removed from content moderation, a responsibility which is placed almost entirely on the userbase itself.

Reply  Post new         jaedos   March 08, 2011 at 4:11PM  Follow    Why am I not surprised in the least that OregonLive would attempt to bastardize this into some kind of scandal. EVEN IF it is a hoax, it still doesn't change what is has inspired in thousands of people. EVEN IF this is all a fake and LucidEnding is just a very skillful troll, what his words mean to so many people doesn't change. He never once asked anything for anything that couldn't be given for free. People will remember his words and they will see their own worlds with a little more color in them. People will wake up tomorrow and think, even for a moment, that their life is a little more valuable. Many will put to foot something they're been procrastinating on doing. If LucidEnding was just a troll; then God, I wish we had a thousand more like him. THIS is what people will remember;  ‎"That nothing we have is worth hurting anyone else for. It's all fleeting people. Stop seeing race, color, sex, religion, etc.... Theyre all just people, and if you try to love them you won't lose anything." ~LucidEnding, Reddit 2011 As for this sad little "news" story; it will simply fade away into obscurity like so many other pointless "news" articles that cross this site.

As for the opponents, someone needs to remind them that making euthanasia by patient consent illegal in no way means that it ceases to exist. Being against the law just forces loyal family members into operating in the shadows, but operate they will.

More over, every cynic is grasping at straws to "prove" this experience a hoax, and they're running with the idea of it's "illegal" for lethal injection to be used in a DWDA. It's only illegal for doctors or anyone else to administer the medication. The patient MUST do it him/herself; it doesn't matter if its injectable or not. Shame on the Oregonian for trying to make everyones' life a little more bitter and cynical-filled by utilizing their typical shoddy reporting and negativity. How one corporate news outlet has focused on what was important in the story: that peoples' lives were changed for the better and a lot of healing went on in that thread. Inappropriate?  Alert us.
