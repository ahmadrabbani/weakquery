"The  United States is very pleased by today's action in Geneva and welcomes Vietnam into the international trade community. The world will benefit from the inclusion of this rapidly-growing, dynamic economy in the rules-based trading system," said U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab in a statement.  "We now call upon Congress to quickly pass Permanent Normal Trade Relations legislation that will permit U.S. businesses, workers and consumers to benefit fully from Vietnam's accession and to build deeper and stronger bilateral trade ties going forward," Schwab added.  "I have been impressed with the strong efforts by the Government of Vietnam to ensure effective implementation of Vietnam's WTO commitments," said the U.S. top trade envoy.  The WTO formally approved Vietnam as a fresh member on Tuesday, nearly 12 years after the Southeast Asian country began accession negotiations.  Vietnam is seen as Asia's best-performing economy after China. With a population of 84 million, it also is the second most populous country behind  Russia still outside the WTO.
