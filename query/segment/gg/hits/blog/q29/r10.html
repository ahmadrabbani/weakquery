          Opening ceremonies for the WTO, and the day the biggest protests were

        <p align="left"><font size="2">Tuesday, morning - outside my apartment.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">Wow, there are a lot of people over here, 
          so far they (the protestors) have the Paramount Theatre (I can see it 
          from my place) surrounded. They started marching from Pine and Broadway 
          where I live and Pike Street Market and converged together on the Paramount 
          where the opening ceremonies of the WTO are supposed to start at 10am.</font></p>

          <p align="center"><font size="2"><img border="0" src="images/lockdown.jpg" width="252" height="186"></font></p>
        </center>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">The city has a bunch of city busses lined 
          up around the Theatre forming a barricade to keep the protestors away. 
          The protestors also have several side streets completely blocked off 
          with a web of police tape that says 'unseen crimes' on it. Earth First 
          dropped a giant blown up gray whale and dropped it in the middle of 
          this intersection (6th and Seneca I think), and they have efficiently 
          shut down traffic for several blocks around. Traffic down here sucks, 
          more like a giant parking lot.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">IT sounded like a war zone earlier. Never 
          heard so many police sirens before, and these big nasty loud police 
          helicopters flying overhead.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2"><img border="0" src="images/ArmedTruck2.jpg" width="345" height="228"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">Um, it sounded like 50,000 protestors are 
          in Seattle (there not all here though), dozen mounted horse police, 
          250 riot gear police.... so far. The cops are just watching everything 
          happen and not doing anything.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2"><img border="0" src="images/LargeCrowd-Gas.jpg" width="349" height="218"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">Its wild. Like this big street party. Loud 
          music, dancing, big puppets. It looks more like mardi gra than a protest. 
          Borne and Pine which is like my onramp to I-5 is totally blocked off, 
          some kind of tepee structure the protestors set up. A bunch of people 
          ducked taped themselves together to prevent anything from going by. 
          Another street, where delegates where supposed to gain access to the 
          convention center through has a bunch of folk chained to these concrete 
          things, a lock down. The police have threatened to arrest them, but 
          they can't move them. Big loud intimidating helicopters flying over. 
          Rain is really nasty.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2">My god, this is so ridiculous. This isn't 
          a protest, its a big party. Everyone is in costumes, a marching band 
          with gas masks, these big 25 foot puppets on stilts or something, street 
          theater, tons of drums, etc. Its all fairly calm though. Cops have backed 
          off and just let the protestors take over. All fairly non-violent</font></p>

          <img border="0" src="images/puppet1.jpg" width="160" height="120"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">Looks like the rain has mellowed out and 
          its not quite as dark.... oh the sirens have started again... watching 
          news... oh, doesn't sound as peaceful and happy anymore... hmmmm looks 
          like a lot of very angry commuters trapped in cars... and police cars 
          backing over these fencer protestors are trying to put up. I have no 
          idea where the buss has been rerouted too, the protestors have closed 
          down a lot more streets than expected. On the news it sounds like there 
          is a not so happy confrontation between cops and protestors at 6th and 
          Seneca, near the convention center. ... Wow, that police helicopter 
          is right at eye level with my apartment. Out my window it looks like 
          the protestors in front of the Paramount have locked arms around the 
          busses in front. The busses have locked them out of the Theatre, but 
          they and them are also locking the delegates out of the Theatre. ... 
          Wait a minute, there is another helicopter - looks more like a army 
          copter than a police one.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">Oh... crapp.. great time for the battery 
          in my camera to die. Why can't they make these things with AA batteries 
          or something a little more common.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">Oh, I have to go check this out.</font></p>

          Police have put the entire city under Code Red alert. Yells and</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">disorder can be heard over airwaves. Ministers have been 
          physically blocked</font> <font SIZE="2">from the Convention Center 
          as police don gas masks. There are no reports of</font> <font SIZE="2">protesters 
          physically assaulting delegates. Limos have been blocked</font> <font SIZE="2">throughout 
          the morning and police have ordered protesters to disperse at 4th</font>

          they think they won and chased them off. I hope that</font> <font SIZE="2">doesn't 
          mean the cops are backing off, to tear gas everybody. I'm sure</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">they'll try to avoid that. I would not want there job 
          right now.</font> <font SIZE="2">Here are some pictures of some of the

        <p align="left"><font SIZE="2">There are some great images, sound bites, 
          and videos of what's happening on</font> <font SIZE="2">the streets 
          here at <a href="http://www.indymedia.org">www.indymedia.org</a></font> 
          <font SIZE="2">Man, these anti-WTO cheerleaders are great. Very humorous. 
          Protestors have</font> <font SIZE="2">taken over the busses and are 
          now partying and chanting on top of them.</font> <font SIZE="2">Delegates 
          still can't get through. Some cops tried to force a way for them</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">through the crowd, it got a little violent, so the cops 
          backed off to</font> <font SIZE="2">reconsider. I'm actually quite relieved 
          and proud of how they are handling</font> <font SIZE="2">things, esp. 
          after how that Pullman riot turned out last year.</font> <font SIZE="2">Looks 
          like the protestors are accomplishing there goal so far. Delegates</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">can't get into the WTO conference and Clinton just said 
          this morning that he</font> <font SIZE="2">was going to try and open 
          the closed-door secretive policy of the WTO and</font> <font SIZE="2">give 
          these groups a voice in what is happening... whatever that means. A 
          lot</font> <font SIZE="2">of the delegates are stopping and talking 
          to the protestors and listening to</font> <font SIZE="2">their viewpoint. 
          They are getting their message across to the right people.</font> <font SIZE="2">And 
          many folk in the WTO are saying that this is great, to hear these</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">viewpoints, and they are going to try their best to make 
          changes this time</font> <font SIZE="2">around.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">Well, if the protestors ever let them 
          through... I think they really need to</font> <font SIZE="2">back off 
          now. They are starting to push things a little too far, and the</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">cops are going to have to be forced to actually use force 
          soon. There is a</font> <font SIZE="2">stand off now in one corner. 
          Police are talking to some of the protest</font> <font SIZE="2">group 
          leaders, and telling them they are severally understaffed and don't</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">have enough cops to do a peaceable arrest. Some protestors 
          are begging to be</font> <font SIZE="2">arrested, that's what they came 
          here for. Police say that if anyone breaks</font> <font SIZE="2">there 
          ranks they'll have to try and arrest everyone and it won't be as</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">peaceable as they would like it to be due to the fact 
          that they are</font> <font SIZE="2">understaffed. Both sides trying 
          to maintain the non-violence situation, but</font> <font SIZE="2">the 
          limits are starting to be pushed.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2">I'm safe. I'm .... maybe 7 blocks from 
          ground zero as they are calling the Paramount theatre now. I can see 
          it over the tops of several apartment buildings. I got a good view straight 
          down Pine Street which has the Paramount, Westlake Mall, and Pike Street 
          Market. So I'm watching with binoculars, listening to all the sirens 
          and helicopter through the windows, and KIRO 7 news has been broadcasting 
          nonstop since I woke up at 7am.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">ooohhh... 50,000 people and rising at Seattle 
          center... families who brought their kids to march... well at least 
          it stopped raining.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">So a no I'm save from the teargas, though 
          I could see some of the clouds earlier. Lets see, a frame of reference. 
          The distance from my apartment to the Paramount is like ADBF from Bryan 
          Hall.</font></p>

        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">Well, its almost midnight now. I went 
          downtown earlier to check things out.</font> <font SIZE="2">At the time 
          things were fairly peaceful. Lots of people everywhere. Human</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">barricades of protestors arm and arm, duck taped, and 
          chained to each other,</font> <font SIZE="2">around a 5block radius 
          to keep the delegates from getting through. Most of</font> <font SIZE="2">the 
          riot police where behind them. Lots of puppets and signs and marchers.</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">Earlier an anarchist group dressed in black had vandalized 
          a lot of stuff</font> <font SIZE="2">and the actual protestors tried 
          to stop them. When I got there, I could see</font> <font SIZE="2">the 
          remains of their passing.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">Nike Town was trashed, along with McDonalds, 
          Gap, Bank of America. Lots of</font> <font SIZE="2">broken windows with 
          chairs and newsstands thrown through and graffiti spray</font> <font SIZE="2">paint 
          everywhere. When I got there, no violence just all the peaceful</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">demonstrators. Did walk into a small group of black clad 
          individuals </font><font size="2">haling</font> <font SIZE="2">dumpsters 
          out of an ally and throwing it into the street, then banging on</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">them. I think they were part of the earlier anarchists.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/JustTryIt.jpg" width="288" height="255">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          <img border="0" src="images/violence.jpg" width="208" height="255"></font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">Met a lot of the Delegates on the street, 
          esp by 6th and University where</font> <font SIZE="2">the crowd was 
          very sparse. This is one of the first streets hit with tear</font> <font SIZE="2">gas 
          earlier but it was really tame when I went through after 12. Only one</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">row of protestors in the barricade so its where the majority 
          of delegates</font> <font SIZE="2">were trying to get through. The cops 
          just stood their ground and didn't help</font> <font SIZE="2">any of 
          them through, which I thought was odd. Down 6th avenue I could see</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">barricades for several blocks and noticed a lot of commotion 
          down at Pine</font> <font SIZE="2">and 6th which is where we were earlier, 
          and where the Paramount Theater and</font> <font SIZE="2">Convention 
          Center are (big locals for the WTO Ministerials). Later on the</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">news I found out that that commotion I saw was the police 
          tear gassing the</font> <font SIZE="2">crowd again.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">Occasionally, we'd walk around a corner 
          and see a bunch of people running.</font> <font SIZE="2">We'd freeze 
          and hope everyone around us did too - don't need to have the</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">whole crowd spontaneously PANIC!!!!! when nothing was 
          happening. For the</font> <font SIZE="2">most part nothing bad at all 
          happened when I was down there, but I did get a</font> <font SIZE="2">lot 
          of PICTURES!!! =) The demonstrations were actually cool, and how often</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">do you get to stand by world leaders and talk to them 
          and over hear their</font> <font SIZE="2">conversations. One guy gave 
          up on getting through and walked by and said,</font> <font SIZE="2">&quot;We 
          were doing a very good job&quot; meaning the protestors were succeeding 
          in</font> <font SIZE="2">closing down the WTO Ministerials since no 
          one could get through the</font> <font SIZE="2">barricade to the them.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">We got bored and tired of hearing about 
          the WTO around 3:30 and left.</font> <font SIZE="2">Decided to just 
          rent movies for awhile. At 8 I tried to go home. Tried...</font> <font SIZE="2">discovered 
          that holy hell had broken out on the streets about an hour after</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">we left. Lots of violence. The actual real protestors 
          had already started to</font> <font SIZE="2">leave and the only people 
          left were all the street punks, anarchists, and</font> <font SIZE="2">other 
          random angry people who started to take advantage of the situation.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">While every cop in Seattle was stuck in 
          this formation protecting the</font> <font SIZE="2">convention center, 
          rioters - not protestors - started vandalizing downtown.</font> <font SIZE="2">Essentially 
          every window of every downtown skyscraper has been busted out.</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">Looters used newsstands and crowbars to break through 
          windows, slashed tires,</font> <font SIZE="2">and broken windows of 
          parked cars, loot businesses with massive destruction</font> <font SIZE="2">to 
          Star Bucks, McDonalds, etc.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font SIZE="2">The Mayor called some kind of state of</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">emergency which included calling in the National Guard, 
          and a 7pm curfew.</font> <font SIZE="2">Anyone downtown from Yesterler 
          to Denny, and the Water to I-5 will be</font> <font SIZE="2">arrested. 
          The protestors left, but about 500 rioters remained. Police</font> <font SIZE="2">stampeded, 
          rushed, drove tanks, and shot tear gas to chase them out of</font> <font SIZE="2">downtown. 
          I don't know how familiar you are with Seattle, but with the</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">waterfront on one side, there is only one place to chase 
          the rioters too...</font> <font SIZE="2">Capital Hill, where I live...</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">While I was blissfully watching Austin 
          Powers, Police chased them up Pine</font> <font SIZE="2">street (I live 
          close to the corner of Pine &amp; Boylston, two blocks off of</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">Broadway, the main drag up here). However, the police 
          didn't stop at I-5,</font> <font SIZE="2">they kept chasing them. I 
          think the long hours of standing, and being yelled</font> <font SIZE="2">at 
          really started getting them, and their aggression started to come out.</font></p>

        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">Police started continuously shooting teargas 
          at whoever was on Pine (there</font> <font SIZE="2">are only about 3 
          streets on Capital Hill that cross I-5 to downtown and Pine</font> <font SIZE="2">is 
          one of them), then they would Billy club those who were made incapacitated</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">by the gas. They pushed the crowd all the way passed 
          my street to Broadway,</font> <font SIZE="2">where rioters had erected 
          a hug bonfire out of garbage bins and had</font> <font SIZE="2">effectively 
          blockaded the the street, a main drag on the Hill. Thats when</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">things got really nearly. The rioters/protestors wouldn't 
          budge, and the poor</font> <font SIZE="2">cops who probably just want 
          to end it and go home pushed the issue. More</font> <font SIZE="2">teargas 
          &amp; pepper spray than all day was fired at this intersection. I had</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">to sneak home by driving through a side street and crossing 
          Pine Street</font> <font SIZE="2">between Broadway and downtown. I could 
          see lots of police, big fire, and</font> <font SIZE="2">lots of white 
          gas clouds. Many of my favorite stores have been vandalized,</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">so I guess it wasn't that much over the top for some 
          of the stores to board</font> <font SIZE="2">their windows up earlier 
          today.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">I'm fine here. I'm on the third floor, 
          on the opposite corner, in a</font> <font SIZE="2">surprisingly quiet 
          neighborhood. No threat of tear gas coming hear, even</font> <font SIZE="2">though 
          it is being shot only two blocks away at the college on Broadway and</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">Pine.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">Out my window, I can see down Pine all 
          the way past the Paramount-Bus</font> <font SIZE="2">barricade &amp; 
          opening ceremony of WTO, Westlake Mall-center of worst</font> <font SIZE="2">vandalism, 
          and Pike Street Market - one start point of this mornings protest</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">march. Its midnight, and even though there is a curfew 
          currently in action</font> <font SIZE="2">downtown, I see quite a few 
          police lights, and lots of car movement. I've</font> <font SIZE="2">heard 
          that all the windows of downtown business are being boarded up for</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">tomorrow since all the windows are broken into.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">IndyMedia.org is located downtown, they 
          are now offline. I assume they were</font> <font SIZE="2">kicked out 
          with the curfew until 7am - there stuff severs, video equipment</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">may also be being confiscated or sifted through - who 
          knows. We'll see if</font> <font SIZE="2">they are streaming tomorrow. 
          If they are they will have photos and videos of</font> <font SIZE="2">this 
          evenings events.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">40,000 people in the labor protest march 
          from Seattle Center to Convention</font> <font SIZE="2">Center, ran 
          into some of them today.</font> <font SIZE="2">I'm listening to the 
          police scanners right now on through the AP News webpage.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">How, odd - its late at night and there 
          are tons of helicopter activity</font> <font SIZE="2">overhead. Hmm....&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font SIZE="2">Reports of 20-30 police cars from Pierce 
          and Thurston</font> <font SIZE="2">County seen traveling on the highway 
          in speeds in excess of 80mph to come up</font> <font SIZE="2">here for 
          backup. Only 22 people arrested today though.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">Oh, one interesting thing I heard. Some 
          of the more organized protest groups</font> <font SIZE="2">have been 
          practicing for months. one of there tactics was to move from</font> 
          <font SIZE="2">intersection to intersection to spread the police out.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font SIZE="2">Well, tonight, they'll get a chance to 
          assess the damage and review</font> <font SIZE="2">evidence. I'm sure 
          We'll hear the totals and statistics tomorrow. Clinton is</font> <font SIZE="2">also
