        <p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2"><span lang="FR-CA" style="mso-ansi-language: FR-CA">The
        mere utterance of the word </span>“subsidies”
        sounds alarm bells in the minds of some international trade policy
        pundits and politicians. Yet, worldwide, governments closely guard the
        right to subsidize. One of the primary functions of modern governments
        is to redistribute income. Taxation and subsidization are major
        instruments governments use to achieve this redistribution. At the same
        time, because governments believe international trade is beneficial,
        they enter into agreements with other countries to regulate
        international commerce, and these agreements place limits on the use of
        subsidies.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: .25in; line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">The
        World Trade Organization (WTO) is the major multilateral institution
        where countries can make commitments that limit their own ability to
        interfere in markets in ways that inhibit or distort trade. Member
        countries of the World Trade Organization have agreed to a number of
        commitments regarding how they use subsidies. One of these commitments
        is to prohibit the use of export subsidies. There are, however, a number
        of exceptions. Until the Uruguay Round Agreement created the WTO in
        1994, agricultural subsidies were governed by a different set of
        commitments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),
        which, in effect, allowed for widespread use of export subsidies. By the
        1980s, the absence of effective commitments to reduce export subsidies
        in agriculture had led to a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">beggar
        thy neighbour</i> subsidy war which significantly distorted agricultural
        trade and put heavy demands on some countries’ treasuries. At the
        Uruguay Round, members agreed to bring export subsidies for agricultural
        commodities under the general World Trade Organization commitments, but
        with a period of transition. The Uruguay Round <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Agreement
        on Agriculture</i> set out the members’ commitments to reduce export
        subsidies for agricultural goods.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: .25in; line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">Because
        reducing subsidies is often difficult for governments, they are only
        likely to comply up to the letter of their WTO commitments. Subsidies
        run contrary to the spirit of free trade embodied in the WTO, but their
        use remains rampant and pervasive worldwide, particularly in some
        sectors, one of which is agriculture.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: .25in; line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">Given
        the high degree of subsidization that exists in agriculture, a great
        deal is at stake both for governments and for the recipients of existing
        subsidies. These high stakes make the exact meaning of the agreements
        extremely important both for those countries faced with reducing export
        subsidies and for those expecting the trade benefits arising from the
        reduction of <del cite="mailto:Leona%20Theis" datetime="2001-02-06T14:59">those
        </del>subsidies. As with any legal agreement, the parties can
        have disagreements about the meaning of the commitments. In the WTO
        these disagreements are settled by the new Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)
        that was put in place when the WTO came into being in the wake of the
        Uruguay Round Agreement. As both the DSB and the commitments to reduce
        export subsidies have only been in place for half a decade, insights
        into how the wording of the agreements is being interpreted are only
        coming to light as cases work their way through the dispute settlement
        system. The rules embodied in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Agreement
        on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement</i>) and the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Agreement on Agriculture (AOA)</i> have received close scrutiny by
        states and have been the frequent topic of disputes in the DSB. The
        results of this scrutiny are extremely important <ins cite="mailto:estey1" datetime="2001-02-06T08:36">and
        </ins>politically charged, particularly in agriculture where the degree
        of subsidization and other market interference remains high.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: .25in; line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">This
        paper provides a framework that can be used to analyze domestic policy
        initiatives to decide whether they comply with the WTO agreements. The
        study details the evolving definition of the term “export subsidies”
        in the WTO. Until now, the literature has provided little detailed
        examination of the meaning of the term. The texts of the relevant
        agreements and the decisions made by the DSB regarding export subsidies
        furnish evidence of how the term “export subsidies” is intended and
        interpreted. Five years of jurisprudence from the DSB demonstrate that
        the wording of the agreements relevant to export of agricultural
        commodities will be interpreted quite literally and legalistically. From
        these judicial pronouncements, the paper develops proposed legal tests
        that can be used to determine whether an export subsidy exists under the
        terms of the agreements. The paper goes on to explore questions about
        the soundness of the economic analysis on which the DSB bases its
        decisions.</font></p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">The
        study has four main sections. The first section supplies background and
        reviews the last ten years of legal literature on WTO rules that affect
        export subsidies. The second part of the paper explores the interpretive
        approach the DSB has taken in addressing disputes. The third part
        provides a detailed interpretation of the meaning of the term “export
        subsidies” under the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">SCM
        Agreement</i>. The fourth section delves into the treatment of export
        subsidies in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">AOA</i>. Each of these latter two sections examines the jurisprudence of
        the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body, and both end with proposed legal
        tests for export subsidies under their respective agreements. The final
        section of the paper provides an economic perspective on the export
        subsidy tests.</font></p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">The
        legal literature follows four major streams. The first provides general
        analysis of WTO provisions on subsidies. This stream provides only a
        broad analysis of subsidy rules without a detailed examination of the
        language involved. There is no detailed analysis of how the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">SCM Agreement</i> and the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">AOA</i>
        relate to each other with respect to the treatment of agricultural
        export subsidies.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: .25in; line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">The
        second area of legal literature looks at the effects the two agreements
        have on the design of legislation and subsidy programs in member
        countries and on the administration of countervailing duty law. The WTO
        has replaced the flexibility of GATT’s consensus-based approach with a
        strict and rigid legalistic approach. The loss of the pragmatic approach
        to problem solving results in an increasingly complex and difficult
        legal approach to dealing with export subsidies.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: .25in; line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">A
        third literature stream analyzes DSB decisions that have focused on
        countervail measures or specific subsidies. The common conclusion is
        that the WTO rules are having a significant, limiting impact on domestic
        policy options in the area of subsidies. The DSB case record appears to
        show that the WTO is getting tough on trade-distorting subsidization.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: .25in; line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">The
        fourth area of legal literature focuses on the impact of WTO subsidies
        law on specific sectors, particularly agriculture. This literature does
        not provide detailed analysis of the ambit of WTO disciplines on export
        subsidies. There is a need for further work in this area.</font></p>

        written decisions in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Canada–Aircraft</i>
        and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Canada–Milk</i> cases have defined a legal test for a financial
        contribution. The test is to determine if there has been a transfer of
        economic resources by the grantor. This is now the general test for
        determining if a financial contribution has been made.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: .25in; line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">A
        fourth type of financial contribution is more ambiguous than the three
        types mentioned above and has been the subject of dispute in the cases
        of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Canada–Automobiles</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">US–Foreign
        Sales Corporations</i>. This fourth type of financial contribution
        occurs when government revenue that is otherwise due is foregone or not
        collected. The foregoing of revenue by government is considered a
        transfer of economic resources from the government, and would fall
        within the general test for a financial contribution. The key issue in
        this type of contribution is to consider when government revenue should
        be considered “otherwise due”. The DSB decisions have established a
        legal test for this element. The legal test is to look for what revenue
        would be due to the government in other circumstances, not including the
        program being challenged. The “other circumstances” referred to are
        the general domestic legislative framework or benchmark that would exist
        apart from the program. Any variation from the domestic legislative
        benchmark would result in the loss of revenue otherwise due to the
        government. This test was applied in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Canada—Automobiles
        </i>case, and the resulting finding was that revenue was foregone from
        an import duty remission. It was also applied in the<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
        US–Foreign Sales Corporations</i> case, and the finding was that
        revenue was foregone from a special tax exemption for export income.</font></p>

        this has been expanded by the DSB to include a consideration of whether
        the transfer of economic resources involves a benefit to the recipients
        as a result of transfer for less than full consideration. Determination
        of whether a transfer has been for less than full consideration requires
        an examination of what is otherwise available to the recipient in the
        domestic marketplace. The domestic marketplace includes all of the
        existing domestic market framework, including the existing government
        programs other than the challenged provision.</font></p>

        demonstrated on the basis of the law or other relevant legal instrument,
        without reference to external factual elements. Contingency “in law”
        can either be stated expressly or implicitly in the law. The DSB has
        confirmed that a subsidy is contingent in law if it is conditional or
        dependent for its existence upon export performance. The DSB has also
        confirmed that it is not necessary to prove actual distortion of trade
        in order to prove export contingency. The only legal test remains
        whether the subsidy is conditional or dependent for its existence upon

        export performance if there is a relationship of conditionality or
        dependence between the grant of the subsidy and the anticipated
        exportation or export earnings. The legal test is further defined as
        including three elements: (1) In providing the subsidy, did the granting
        authority impose a condition based on export performance? (2) Was the
        subsidy tied to export performance through limiting or restricting
        conditions? and (3) Is there objective evidence that the subsidy was
        tied to actual or anticipated exportation or to export earnings? Thus a

        price for export milk that would have resulted in no “payment” in
        the Special Milk Class Scheme. The question of pooled returns would then
        have been irrelevant. This analysis also points to a path to the future
        for other pooled returns in agriculture, such as those administered by
        the Canadian Wheat Board, for example. Pooling schemes themselves are <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">not</i>

        Analysis Questions</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">The economic
        analysis of export subsidy law deals with two major questions. The first
        relates to the question of what constitutes a transfer of economic
        resources. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The
        second major question is whether the WTO legal test has set an
        economically defensible benchmark price or framework for establishing a
        benchmark price. </span> These questions must be considered in
        light of the reality of existing WTO rules, which are not always
        consistent with economic theory. Instead, they represent what countries,
        collectively, can “live with” as part of a system of compromises.
        Therefore, the economic analysis in this paper does not test WTO export
        subsidy reduction commitments against standard economic criteria such as
        welfare maximization. Further, the WTO rules do not require an
        examination of whether a particular export subsidy actually distorts
        trade. Export subsidies are assumed to be trade distorting, as the
        members have agreed to ban their use.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">The WTO commonly
        conducts its economic analysis within a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">partial
        equilibrium–comparative statics</i> framework. The test the DSB uses
        to determine whether a transfer of resources has taken place must be
        carried out within this framework. This means that the appropriate
        starting point in the analysis is the observed state of the market prior
        to the export subsidy program. This analysis is appropriate for
        answering the question of whether those who are engaged in exporting
        have more resources than they did before the policy was introduced. The
        DSB is precluded from asking whether those extra resources lead to an
        increase in exports. This results in a divergence between economic
        questions relating to export subsidies and the legal questions that are
        now involved.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">The legal test
        regarding the transfer of economic resources also leaves unanswered a
        further economic question: Does the transfer of economic resources
        necessarily reduce the economic resources available to other activities?
        This is not part of the legal test, but it would be relevant to
        assessing whether this type of transfer resources should be prohibited.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">With respect to the
        reference price or legislative framework, the economic analysis
        concludes that the DSB has properly applied partial
        equilibrium–comparative statics analysis. The proper reference price
        or benchmark price is the market price that would otherwise exist. This
        would not likely be the theoretical price that would be found in a
        theoretical, “first best world”, since any market is necessarily
        distorted. The domestic benchmark is the accepted economic starting
        point for an export subsidy analysis.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: 100%"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">The analysis
        concludes that a market pooling system is not synonymous with a transfer
        of resources. A detailed analysis of the mechanics of each pooling
        system would have to be conducted to determine if there was a transfer
        of resources from one group to another.</font></p>

        study shows that new international law delineating illegal from legal
        export subsidies has rapidly developed in the WTO. A review of the cases
        that have come before the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body demonstrates
        that the DSB will interpret the words of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Agreement
        on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures</i> and the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Agreement on Agriculture</i> quite literally and legalistically. The DSB
        has developed a very broad definition of the term “export subsidy”.
        The requirement of a financial contribution is now defined as any
        transfer of economic resources. The requirement of a benefit is defined
        as a transfer of resources for less than full consideration, using the
        marketplace to provide a benchmark for comparison of the value and
        consideration. Finally, export contingency can be defined as being
        conditional, in law or in fact, upon objectively anticipated
        exportation.</span></font></p>

        the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">SCM Agreement</i> into the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">AOA</i>
        context. But the DSB has not stopped there. In addition, certain

        the work of the DSB on the difficult job of defining “export

        legalistically and sometimes rigidly following the literal
        interpretation, the DSB has, to this point, failed to fully explore
        appropriate economic principles upon which to base its decisions.
        Ultimately, the question that remains to be answered is whether the
        DSB’s literal definitions, without appropriate reference to solid
        economics, will ultimately help to eliminate trade-distorting export
        subsidies. Are the legalistic decisions apt to create more confusion
        about what practices are allowed because those decisions are out of sync

        the illegal export subsidy net? Regardless of member intentions, will
        members now accept that their national marketing schemes may be illegal
