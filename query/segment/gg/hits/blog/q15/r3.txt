But the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter has already become a target before it has even faced an enemy in the air, and many of its wounds are self-inflicted: The program is years behind schedule and now estimated to cost $1 trillion. And the delays have forced the military to buy upgraded versions of older aircraft to fill the gaps. Continue Reading Text Size - + reset       POLITICO 44        Lawmakers are questioning whether the U.S. military needs 2,400 advanced jets that cost an estimated $133 million each and are more expensive to maintain than current warplanes while the Pentagon is under intense pressure to reduce spending and recover from 10 years of combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. They aren’t alone. A commission appointed by President Barack Obama to study ways to reduce the national debt recommended in December that $9.5 billion could be saved through fiscal year 2015 by replacing about half of planned F-35 purchases with newer models of current fighters. The commission contended the military did not need that many fighters with the capabilities of the F-35. The commission also recommended canceling the Marine Corps short takeoff/vertical landing version of the F-35, which has been plagued by technical problems, cost overruns and schedule delays. Outgoing Defense Secretary Robert Gates put that part of the program on probation, threatening to cancel it if the problems aren’t quickly solved. “The facts regarding this program are truly troubling,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said at a May 19 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the F-35 program. Describing the $1 trillion cost of the program as “a jaw-dropping amount,” the former Navy carrier pilot said, “We need to know that the program is going to bring that number down.” Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition Ashton Carter told lawmakers at the hearing that the Pentagon would review the program to see whether costs can be reduced, with a goal of shaving 10 percent to 30 percent off the $1 trillion figure. “That’s what it’s going to cost if we keep doing what we’re doing. And that’s unacceptable. It’s unaffordable at that rate,” he said. The F-35 program, which began in 2001, survived previous rounds of cost-cutting, which ended similar big-ticket weapons programs such as the F-22 fighter, because the military needs to replace current fighters, which are on average 20 to 30 years old and are approaching the end of their service lives. Pentagon officials argue that the F-35’s advanced technology is needed to counter the threat posed by China’s rapid advances in capability. “We must field a next-generation strike fighter — the F-35 — and at a cost that permits large enough numbers to replace the current fighter inventory and maintain a healthy margin of superiority over the Russians and Chinese,” Gates said in a May 24 speech to the American Enterprise Institute. A Chinese stealth fighter, the J-20, made its first test flight in January while Gates was visiting Beijing. Some analysts suspect the technology was at least in part stolen from the F-35 program, raising fears that China would benefit from the program’s innovations before the United States and its allies.     « 1 2  »   20 Comments       RSS   Email  Print    Back to top Read more about: Military , Air Force , F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , Federal Deficit , Deficit Reduction    Get reporter alerts Charles Hoskinson Email            More on POLITICO   New Hampshire: Mitt's must-win state     Bachmann-Pawlenty grudge match     Sarah Palin takes the media for a ride     Boehner calls for debt deal in a month        Readers' Comments (20) Show the first 20 comments    JabbaJabba Party: NA   Reply #1  Jun. 2, 2011 - 6:30 AM EST   The true question that Pentagon must answer: DOES IT NEED SO MANY ****ING PLANES??????

We obviously need a strong military but that requires one that gets "bang for the buck." DoD seems incapable of keeping these programs within budget. Congress usually fails to maintain budget discipline (just look at the cost overruns for the visitors center on the Hill) - maybe because its not their money. The private sector does not appear to have any incentive to keep costs down. Senior excutives of defense firms get multi-million dollar pay days regardless of whether they deliver to DoD on time and on budget. Obama promised change but has not delivered. Republicans are unlikely to challenge the hand that feeds them. So, who will break this knot? Alexander took a sword to the problem to solve it but the political class in this country lacks the leadership skills to solve this problem.

This is a generational developmental fighter. A lot of new technology is being developed as this aircraft comes on line (for instance a fused sensor system instead of the federated system our current fighters use). 2) the costs I've seen consistently associated with the F-35 are $65 to 75 million a copy (depending on variant), unit recurring flyaway cost (URF) which is the most common way of doing an apples to apples comparison. That's about the same cost as a fully equipped 4th generation fighter (like the "Super Hornet") costs today. Those costs are predicated on full production numbers (2443). Why so many? Because they reflect the numbers in the older fleet we're replacing. 3) the trillion dollar cost is most likely the Total Ownership Cost (TOC). The aircraft will be in service for 40 to 50 years (they have a service life of 30 years, but the last F35 will be manufactured in 2035 giving the fleet the longer service life). Imagine the cost of a B-52 50 years ago. Now imagine the Total Cost of Ownership given the fact that it is still flying today. My guess is if we'd have projected those costs out in 1950 dollars at that time, we'd have heard similar comments about "jaw dropping cost". 4) whether or not we build these aircraft, China and Russia are. Russia's model (T-50) has been quoted at "$100 million" a copy. I have no idea what that cost includes, but it indicates that our costs aren't at all out of line. Bottom line, whether or not we develop the F-35 5th genreation fighter, our pilots are likely to someday face enemies who have. I'd prefer ours have at least the same if not superior technology.

But that was just the very beginning of the financial hemorrhage. Harvard scholar Linda Bilmes and Nobel-Prize winning Columbia University economist Joseph Stiglitz now estimate that the two post-9/11 wars will end up costing taxpayers somewhere between $4 trillion and $6 trillion. That includes not only money already appropriated for the military campaigns ($1.3 trillion at last count), but also the immense cost of long-term health care for returning soldiers, and such things as interest payments on all the extra borrowed money and the increased volatility of oil prices since the invasion of Iraq. "One of the main reasons that our national debt has increased so much over this past decade is because of the spending on the wars and the military buildup,” Bilmes told The Huffington Post. “All of that money has been borrowed.” The post-9/11 era is defined by a series of choices, the biggest and most expensive of which was President George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq. When it comes to the $4-6 trillion estimate, “I think between two thirds and three quarters of it is Iraq," Bilmes said. "I ask myself, would the economy be so weak, would we still be bogged down in Afghanistan, would oil prices be where they are, would we have lost so much blood and treasure, would the national debt be as high as it is, if we had not made the decision to go into Iraq? “ Bilmes said. “I think the answer is 'no' to all those questions.” http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...  ps Clinton last budget 2001 was $1.8T   Reply  Quote  Report Abuse       henric668 Party: Independent   Reply #6  Jun. 2, 2011 - 9:53 AM EST   To have continued DoD spending we need a strong economy. A strong economy is what allows us to have the best military in the world. Fix the economy and create jobs first. Address health care because it's killing this country not just Medicare. The exploding cost of Health Care will kill Medicare but it will also kill this whole country. If you don't fix those issue we will become a second tier country and defense spending will suffer whether you want to or not.

How many do you think we've got? Go look it up. You may be surprised as just how few we have that are airworthy, and how much we are expected to do with them. Another hint: If it doesn't have "F" in the designator, it can't shoot down enemy aircraft. If it doesn't have "F" "A" "H" or "B" in the name, it has no weapons of any type and can't inflict damage on the enemy. For that matter, most of the "H" (helicopters) have nothing more than small arms. So, to answer your question, YES, we need what we have, and more.

The question is whether we need to update all of them, at the same time, with this very model. To the best of my knowledge, they were never ever used simultaneously in a military operation. In fact, if anything, in Iraq and Afghanistan US Army was running out of low-tech Kevlar protective vests and armoured vehicles, not out of planes. Our biggest problem is that we're wasting a million-dollar rockets on 10k-dollar targets (yes, drones did help). So, maybe, just maybe, we should care more about our capacity to man and produce 2000 planes should the need arise, and not actually about having 2000 planes.

My guess is to fill some pockets in the industrial/military complex. The old bogey man of the Chinese and Russian spending always comes out after a overrun or a big spending spurt to scare us. What a joke. The last real war was world war two the rest of this baloney has been empire building. We need to have ten times the aircraft carriers than the rest of the world and now these jets to protect them from communist Chinese rockets that we have paid for with our own money. This is a joke on the American people who sacrifice so the few can get rich. Why not use the money to pay the bills and protect the borders and rebuild the USA.?

President Eisenhower warned of the military industrial complex six decades ago. The government process has changed little over the past six decades; only the people in the jobs have changed. First of all, we have a revolving door between the major aerospace contractors and the government. A person starts as an executive in a major aerospace company. He or she will then go to work for the government as a senior executive. While in the government he or she will help out their old company with information and often contracts. After a period of five years or so the government executive will go back to work for a major aerospace company or study organization and continue to milk his or her contacts. Secondly, any seasoned program manager in government knows to go with a low cost estimate in the early stages of a program. If he or she were to give a realistic estimate, the congress simply would not fund the program. The game is to get congress to spend a lot of money on the program in the early stages. The major aerospace contractor will then say that the government has spent X millions so far, if you quit the program now all of that money is lost. Thirdly, the major aerospace contractors contribute millions to the campaigns of their favorite congress persons. They have large staffs in the Washington area to constantly flood the capital with information and more importantly, money and other perks. Last of all, the game has not changed over the past six decades due to the lack of any interest in the congress to change the game. The name of the game is to get into a chairmanship of a committee in congress so that a congress person can provide the pork to his or her state.

Go look it up. And consider the fact that different planes do different things, just like cars. Most people with more than one car don't get all of the same kind. Same for aircraft. The F-15 and F-16 have very different capabilities. The F-22 and F-35, likewise. Either you build aircraft to fit every need, or you leave needs uncovered. We need air superiority, close support, Fast FAC, ground strike and interceptor aircraft. We need to have the BEST, or at least better than our enemies have. We have guys flying airframes that are older than they are. We have B-52 aircraft commanders whose fathers and grandfathers were B-52 ACs, and at least three that I know of are flying planes older than their FATHERS who flew B-52s. Old airframes break. Metal fatigues. When all of a particular spare part are gone, you have to tool up and build more, or ground all of the planes needing them. All of these things are expensive. The bottom line is that if we can't control our skies, SOMEONE ELSE WILL. And our people will DIE. Let me put it another way. It's tomorrow, and there is a plane over US territory with a red star on its wing and a nuclear bomb under each wing.

Because the "original costs" are ALWAYS under-stated by significant amounts in order to get awarded. In a competitive bid, the companies underbid each other to get the contract -- knowing that they'll make it up long term in the opeations and maintence lifetime of the system. In a sole source bid, the company will over promise and under bid in order to convince the government to make the award. And again-- they know that long term they'll get that money back. It's built into the system where we have a Congress -- any and every Congress -- likes to be seen "saving money" on the award, knowing that over the 20 to 30 to 40 years of service for something like an aircraft carrier or type of airplane, the "cost overruns" won't be on their watch.

Thus -- it has multiple variants, and this, of course, will make its costs much higher. Another problem that usually accompanies such a "one fits all" approach is that while the plane will do many things well, it probably won't do any one thing as good as it good. E.G. -- as you point out, the F15 and F16 have different roles that influenced their designs and capabilities. Can an F35 do both roles as well as possible? Don't know. But usually this approach results in compromises to certain performance characteristics for one mission in order to be able to do another.
