* While the US military's current first-line aircraft remain formidable
weapons, their basic designs are decades old, and the services would like to
obtain more modern aircraft to fit their future needs.  The US Air Force, the
US Navy (USN), the US Marine Corps (USMC), and the British Royal Navy (RN)
have now committed to a new, advanced attack aircraft, the Lockheed Martin
F-35 &quot;Joint Strike Fighter (JSF)&quot;.  This document outlines the history of the
JSF effort.

<P>
* The Joint Strike Fighter program began with defense reviews conducted by
the Clinton Administration after taking office in 1992.  At the time, several
government organizations were working on next-generation strike aircraft.
<P>
The US Navy had been working in secret on an advanced stealthy strike
aircraft named the &quot;A-12 Avenger II&quot;, but the program ran into financial
trouble, and was cancelled shortly after going public in 1991.  The Navy
requirement remained open and evolved into a new effort designated &quot;Attack /
Fighter - Experimental (A/F-X)&quot;.  The USAF was also considering a
next-generation strike aircraft and a replacement for the F-16, with the
designation of &quot;Multi-Role Fighter (MRF)&quot;.
<P>
On another track, the US Marine Corps had been interested in a follow-on for
their AV-8B Harrier II &quot;short takeoff, vertical landing (STOVL)&quot; attack
aircraft, while the British Royal Navy wanted a next-generation STOVL fighter
to replace their Sea Harrier naval STOVL fighters.  The two services
collaborated on STOVL research in the late 1980s, with control of this effort
finally picked up by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
in 1989.
<P>
DARPA conducted studies on new STOVL concepts over the next few years.
During this time, the USMC had expanded their vision from a STOVL aircraft to
replace the Harrier to one that would also replace their F/A-18 Hornet
fighters.  DARPA began to see the advanced STOVL fighter as a basis for a
&quot;conventional take-off and landing (CTOL)&quot; aircraft as well, and the concept
became known as the &quot;Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter (CALF)&quot;.
<P>
In September 1993, the Clinton Administration killed the Navy A/F-X and Air
Force MRF projects.  The Pentagon was allowed to set up a research office to
investigate &quot;Joint Advanced Strike Technologies (JAST)&quot; applicable to
fulfilling these requirements at some unspecified time in the future.  A few
months later, the US Congress mandated that the DARPA-led CALF research
effort be merged into the JAST office.  At first, the JAST office was
generally regarded as just another inept defense boondoggle, but under the
direction of Air Force Major General George Muellner it quickly attained a
critical mass for actually building a next-generation strike fighter.
Muellner wanted to build a &quot;universal fighter&quot; that would fulfill the needs
of all the participants, and was able to get everyone pulling in more or less
the same direction.
<P>
One of the primary goals of the JAST effort was &quot;affordability&quot;.  In the wake
of the end of the Cold War, procurement funds for new combat aircraft were
hard to come by, particularly because the Clinton Administration was
determined to balance the budget while simultaneously conducting expensive
military interventions all over the world.  Although the US economy was in an
extraordinary boom at the time, this ironically led to further constraints on
the military budget, since the services had to increase pay to keep their
people.
<P>
* The JAST concept that emerged did not define a single aircraft, but three
different aircraft based on common technology:
<UL>
<P>
<LI> The USAF wanted an affordable conventional attack aircraft with stealth,
   advanced avionics, and low life-cycle and operational costs, along with
   high reliability and good range, speed, and warload.
<P>
<LI> The US Navy requirement for carrier (&quot;CV&quot; in USN nomenclature) operation
   was similar, but added bigger wings for low-speed carrier approaches, as
   well as heavier landing gear and an arresting hook for carrier landings.
   The Navy traditionally was biased against single-seat, single-engine
   aircraft, but the JAST office managed to persuade them that the new
   aircraft would be highly survivable.
<P>
<LI> The USMC and the Royal Navy wanted an advanced attack aircraft with
   excellent STOVL characteristics for operation from forward battlefield
   areas, or the smaller Marine helicopter carriers and British &quot;jump jet&quot;
   carriers.
</UL>
<P>
The JAST also had to perform a secondary air-defense mission, using
air-to-air missiles (AAMs) to defend itself, or to protect fleet assets from
airborne intruders.  High performance was not a requirement, though of course
it was desireable.  Performance was specified to be comparable to existing
F-16s and F/A-18s operating in the strike role, though any incidental
improvements in performance were welcome.  Nominal top speed was specified as
Mach 1.5, or about 1,600 KPH (1,000 MPH).
<P>
The answer to all these requirements was to develop a baseline CTOL aircraft
at a base price for the USAF requirement, and variants at incrementally
higher prices with the added features needed for CV or STOVL operations.  The
STOVL variant was to have essentially the same performance as the other two
variants.  This was an ambitious requirement, but the DARPA STOVL studies had
indicated that STOVL technology had finally matured to the point where such a
thing was possible.
<P>
The JAST concept that emerged envisioned a stealthy, single-seat aircraft,
with a high degree of cockpit automation to make life easier for the pilot.
It would accommodate sensors and avionics adequate for its mission.  It would
be fitted with an advanced radar system, working in conjunction with other
electronic and infrared systems for defense and all-weather attack, but would
not feature a highly optimized integration of systems in order to lower costs
and preserve flexibility.
<P>
The stealth requirement meant that JAST would be able to accommodate a small
warload internally, consisting of two guided munitions and a pair of AAMs,
along with a much larger warload on underwing stores pylons.  The JAST would
operate strictly with internal weapons during initial phases of an air
campaign, allowing it to perform stealthy strikes to suppress air defenses or
hit heavily defended targets, and then carry heavier external loads in later
phases of a conflict.  The JAST office referred to this operational concept
as &quot;first day stealth&quot;.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="m2">[2] JSF COMPETITION</A></H2>
<P>
* Major aircraft manufacturers began to consider JAST designs in 1994.  The
JAST program office issued a request for proposals in March 1996.  A short
time later, the project name was changed to &quot;Joint Strike Fighter (JSF)&quot; to
indicate that they were working on real flying hardware, not blue-sky design
concepts.  Three companies offered proposals to meet the JSF request:
<UL>
<P>
<LI> McDonnell Douglas, working with Northrop Grumman and British Aerospace,
   came up with a largely conventional design but with no tailfin, just a set
   of tailplanes at a shallow dihedral.  This configuration was felt to
   provide less drag and greater stealth.
<P>
   The STOVL version of the McDonnell Douglas JSF proposal featured a main
   engine with side nozzles under the rear fuselage that could be opened to
   provide vertical thrust, as well as a vectored exhaust that could be
   rotated 20 degrees in any direction, both to assist in short takeoffs and
   for enhanced flight maneuverability.  The STOVL variant also included a
   separate &quot;lift engine&quot; installed vertically behind the cockpit for
   vertical thrust.
<P>
   The CTOL variant for the USAF deleted the lift jet and replaced it with a
   fuel tank for longer range.  The CV variant for the USN had more wing area
   for carrier landings, and other appropriate gear for carrier operations.
<P>
<LI> Boeing, which had not produced an operational fighter since the P-26
   Peashooter of the 1930s, chose an unusual (unkindly described by some as
   &quot;butt-ugly&quot;) design with smooth stealthy contours, a delta wing, a vee
   tail, and a scoop jet intake under the nose.
<P>
   The STOVL version of the Boeing JSF proposal drove engine thrust forward
   to a pair of vectored lift nozzles under the aircraft's center of gravity.
   The nose intake scoop hinged forward to provide greater airflow for a
   short takeoff.  To achieve the thrust needed for STOVL operation, Boeing
   began work with Pratt &amp; Whitney to uprate the thrust of the already
   powerful F119 afterburning turbofan, designed for the Lockheed Martin F-22
   Raptor.
<P>
   Boeing's JSF configuration for the CTOL and CV variants deleted STOVL
   features in favor of greater fuel capacity.  The stubby wing, which had a
   span short enough to allow it to be conveniently stowed without folding
   even on the smaller British carriers, also provided large fuel capacity,
   giving the Boeing design considerable range.
<P>
<LI> The Lockheed-Martin JSF was a more conventional design, resembling a
   single-engined version of the company's F-22 Raptor, though it did have a
   high degree of stealthy contouring as well.  The STOVL version featured a
   vertically mounted &quot;lift fan&quot; behind the cockpit, driven by a shaft off
   the P&amp;W F119 engine, plus a vectored exhaust and two exhaust ducts,
   extending from each side of the engine to exit in the bottom of the wings.
<P>
   The lift fan approach had the advantage that it minimized hot exhaust
   ingestion back into engine, a common problem with STOVL designs that robs
   them of vertical thrust.  The configuration had some resemblance to that
   pioneered by the Russian Yakovlev Yak-41 &quot;Freestyle&quot; STOVL fighter.  For
   the CTOL and CV variants, the lift fan was deleted and replaced with
   additional fuel tanks.  The wings and tail were smaller for the CTOL
   version.
</UL>
<P>
The STOVL designs from all the manufacturers had the same infrared signatures
in normal flight as the CTOL and CV variants.  This was an improvement from
the Harrier, whose four rotating exhaust nozzles arranged around the
aircraft's center of gravity were regarded by critics as providing a perfect
&quot;bulls-eye&quot; for heat-seeking missiles.
<P>
* In 1996, the Boeing and Lockheed-Martin concepts were selected as
finalists, and both companies then began formal development of demonstrator
aircraft.  The elimination of McDonnell Douglas from the competition was
a major blow to that company, and one of the contributing factors to the
company's subsequent buyout by Boeing.  The Boeing demonstrator received the
designation &quot;X-32&quot;, while the Lockheed Martin demonstrator received the
designation &quot;X-35&quot;.
<P>
In 1998 Boeing performed a major redesign of its JSF concept to reduce cost
and weight, changing its pure delta-wing configuration by adding a
conventional tailplane.  The Boeing demonstrator was not changed to the new
configuration.  In production, Boeing envisioned its USAF JSF CTOL variant to
have an empty weight of 10 tonnes (22,000 pounds), a wingspan of 11 meters
(36 feet), and a length of 13.7 meters (45 feet).  The USN CV variant would
be similar, except it would weigh almost a tonne more, due to the need for
stronger landing gear, arrester hook, and other equipment required for
carrier landings.  As with the original Boeing JSF demonstrator design, the
wings did not fold.  The USMC and Royal Navy STOVL variants were to weigh 10
tonnes, though the wings were to be clipped, with a span of 9.15 meters (30
feet).
<P>
<IMG SRC="avf35_2.jpg" ALT="Boeing X-32A demonstrator">
<P>
* First flight of the Boeing &quot;X-32A&quot; CTOL variant was on 18 September 2000.
First flight of the &quot;X-35B&quot; STOVL variant was in March 2001, with vertical
flight testing beginning in June 2001.  First flight of the Lockheed Martin
&quot;X-35A&quot; CTOL variant was on 24 October 2000, with first flight of the &quot;X-35C&quot;
CV variant on 16 December 2000.  The X-35A was then updated the &quot;X-35B&quot; STOVL
configuration by addition of the lift fan system and other hardware, with
initial vertical flight testing in June 2001.
<P>
<IMG SRC="avf35_3.jpg" ALT="Lockheed Martin X-35A demonstrator">
<P>
In October 2001, the Lockheed Martin X-35 was selected as the winner of the
competition.  Boeing was perceived as having the edge in management, while
both companies were rated equally on cost and support.  However, the Lockheed
Martin design was seen as involving lower risk, with the lift-fan concept for
the STOVL variant scoring particular points on the win.  
<P>
Lockheed Martin expects to build 3,000 JSFs, including:
<UL>
<P>
<LI> 1,763 &quot;F-35A&quot; CTOL variants for the USAF, replacing F-16s and A-10s. 
<P>
<LI> 609 &quot;F-35B&quot; STOVL variants for the USMC, replacing F/A-18C/Ds and AV-8B
   Harriers.
<P>
<LI> 480 &quot;F-35C&quot; CV variants for the US Navy, replacing F/A-18C/D Hornets.
<P>
<LI> 138 &quot;Joint Combat Aircraft (JCA)&quot;, as the British refer to the JSF, for
   the British Royal Navy and Royal Air Force to replace the Harrier GR.7/9
   and as an element of the &quot;Future Offensive Aircraft System (FOAS)&quot;.
</UL>
<P>
In 2004, the Air Force also expressed interest acquiring hundreds of the
F-35B STOVL variant for the battlefield close-support role.  The USAF is
interested in a range of options for their STOVL variant, but JSF program
officials have insisted that they do not want to develop a fourth JSF variant
strictly for the Air Force.
<P>
The British ended up at loggerheads with the Americans over the program for a
time.  The British wanted to have &quot;operational sovereignty&quot; over their
F-35s, allowing them to modify and upgrade their machines as they wished.
The sticking point was that this meant they would be supplied with the
source code for the F-35's elaborate computer software, and the Americans
were reluctant to give it up, fearing that security would be compromised.
In late 2006, an agreement was hammered out; the details were secret, but it
was clear that the UK was not going to pull out of the program.
<P>
The actual mix of British aircraft remains a bit up in the air.  While the
British have committed to the F-35B STOVL variant as a Harrier replacement,
the requirement in that case is from 60 to 90 aircraft.  The remainder are
likely to be the F-35C CV variant.  Two new British carriers are being built
to go into service in the next decade.  They will be built to handle STOVL
aircraft, but will be designed to accommodate catapult and arresting gear in
case the decision is made to operate fixed-wing aircraft as well.  The F-35
was given the official name of &quot;Lightning II&quot; in the summer of 2006, as a
tribute to both the US Lockheed P-38 Lightning and the British English
Electric Lightning.
<P>
* The JSF program is now in the &quot;system design and development (SDD)&quot; phase.
The SDD plan involves the construction of 15 flight-test aircraft and seven
static-test airframes.  The F-35B ran into problems with &quot;weight creep&quot;, with
Lockheed Martin performing substantial redesign of structural elements and
other features to trim well more than a tonne off the fighter's weight,
allowing it to return to a carrier without having to dump heavy munitions.
<P>
First flight of an SDD aircraft, an F-35A CTOL variant, was on 15 December
2006, with company test pilot Jon Beesley at the controls.  An F-35B
performed its first (conventional) takeoff on 11 June 2008, with CTOL flights
to begin in 2009.  The first F-35C was rolled out on 29 July 2009, with first
flight expected before the end of the year.  The F-35A will go into service
in 2011, with the F-35B following in 2012 and the F-35C in 2014.
<P>
Along with the UK, other foreign partners in the program include, with their
projected buys:
<UL>
<P>
<LI> Australia (100)
<P>
<LI> Canada (60)
<P>
<LI> Denmark (48)
<P>
<LI> Italy (131)
<P>
<LI> The Netherlands (85)
<P>
<LI> Norway (48)
<P>
<LI> Turkey (100)
</UL>
<P>
There has been interest from a number of other nations as well.  As of late,
there's been concern over cost increases, with some estimates claiming the
cost is doubled, though advocates of the program insist these estimates are
gross exaggerations.  The program did suffer enough problems to lead to a 
change in management.  For the moment, the F-35 remains on track.
<P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="m3">[3] F-35 IN DEVELOPMENT</A></H2>
<P>
* Lockheed Martin released a &quot;finalized&quot; design for the production F-35 in
the summer of 2002.  The F-35 has a nose 12 centimeters (5 inches) longer
than the X-35 demonstrator, while the tailplane has been moved back 5
centimeters (2 inches), and the tailfins have been rearranged a bit.  All the
flight controls, except for the electromechanically driven leading-edge
flaps.  are driven by an interesting &quot;electro-hydrostatic actuation system
(EHAS)&quot;, in which the actuators are all hydraulic -- but are self-contained
and driven by electrical signals, not operating off a central hydraulic
system.  This gives the advantage of hydraulic power with easier maintenance
and greater combat survivability than traditional hydraulic systems.
Although the individual weight of each of the EHAS actuators is more than
that of a traditional actuator, the overall system weight is less.
<P>
Compared to the USAF F-35A CTOL variant, the USN F-35C CV variant has a
larger wing and tail, giving it better range and good low-speed carrier
landing characteristics.  The wing features folding wingtips.  Of course, the
F-35C has stronger landing gear and an arrester hook.  The F-35B STOVL
version has shorter tailfins, implemented as part of the weight-reduction
redesign.
<P>
<IMG SRC="avf35_4.png" ALT="F-35A versus F-35B versus F-35C">
<P>
The Air Force F-35A has a refueling-boom socket behind the cockpit, while the
F-35B and F-35C have a retractable refueling probe on the right side of the
nose.  The tricycle landing gear, with a forward retracting nosewheel and
inward-retracting main gear, has single wheels on all assemblies in the F-35A
and F-35B.  The F-35C differs in having twin wheels on the nose gear to
handle hard carrier touchdowns.
<P>
The F-35's airframe makes heavy use of composite materials, with much work
placed on reducing the cost of composite assemblies, which have traditionally
been extremely expensive.  In fact, the F-35 has been designed to be as cheap
to manufacture as possible, using the latest computer-aided design and
manufacturing tools.
<P>
The F-35 is powered by a modified version of the P&amp;W F119 engine, designated
the &quot;F135&quot;.  While it is as powerful as the original F119, it is much
cheaper, as it uses lower-cost components at the expense of greater weight.
It has the same thrust levels as the F119, with 151 kN (15,420 kgp / 34,000
lbf) dry thrust and up to 222 kN (22,675 kgp / 50,000 lbf) afterburning
thrust.  The engine intake ducting is arranged in a &quot;serpentine&quot; fashion to
eliminate radar reflections from the compressor blades.
<P>
Although the P&amp;W F119 engine was selected as the basis for the different
engine options of the JSF, in 1995 the US Congress indicated a need for an
&quot;Alternate Engine&quot; as a backup plan.  The GE F120, originally designed for
the F-22 Raptor program in competition with the P&amp;W F119, was selected as the
Alternate Engine, and modifications to the F120 as the &quot;F136&quot; for the F-35
are under development by a collaboration of GE, Allison, and Rolls-Royce.
Thrust levels will of course be similar to those of the F119.  The F136
Alternative Engine program has been controversial, with efforts in Congress
to cut the program, but so far it has survived.
<P>
The shaft-driven lift fan for the STOVL F-35B is built by Rolls-Royce /
Allison, and provides up to 80 kN (8,150 kgp / 18,000 lbf) of lift thrust.
<P>
<IMG SRC="avf35_5.jpg" ALT="Lockheed Martin F-35B">
<P>
* The F-35 has two weapons bays, each of which can accommodate a single Joint
Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) GPS-guided bomb and an AIM-120 Advanced
Medium-Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM).  The F-35A and F-35C can carry two
900 kilogram (2,000 pound) JDAMS internally, while the STOVL F-35B is limited
to internal carriage of two 450 kilogram (1,000 pound) JDAMs.  The F-35A and
F-35C variants have bulged weapons bays to accommodate the larger munitions;
the F-35B's weapons bays also have less internal volume.  All variants of the
F-35 can carry up to eight 112 kilogram (250 pound) Small Diameter Bombs
(SDBs) internally.  The two bays have two doors each, with the AMRAAM fitted
on a launch rail on the inner door.
<P>
Four stores pylons can be attached to all variants to provide a much larger
warload, at the expense of stealth.  The inner pylon on each wing is rated
for up to 2,270 kilograms (5,000 pounds), while the outer pylon is rated for
up to 1,135 kilograms (2,500 pounds).
<P>
Only the USAF F-35A has a built-in gun.  Early plans were for carriage of a
variant of the Mauser BK-27 27 millimeter revolver-type cannon, but the final
decision was to go with the GE GAU-12/U 25 millimeter five-barrel
Gatling-type cannon, like that used on the US Marine AV-8B Harrier.  It will
fire out the top of the left wingroot and will have a store of 182 rounds.
Maximum rate of fire is 3,300 rounds per minute.  The other variants do not
have a built-in gun, but can carry a &quot;stealthy&quot; cannon pod for the GAU-12/U
between the weapons bays, with the pod accommodating 220 rounds of
ammunition.
<P>
* Northrop Grumman is developing the sensor suite for the F-35.  The initial
design assumption was that the JSF would be a consumer of sensor data,
obtaining information from specialized intelligence-gathering aircraft,
satellites, and other sources.  This approach promised to keep costs down.
However, as the pieces began to fit together, something different emerged.
This was partly due to the &quot;bottom-up&quot; realization that the new technologies
being developed for the JSF were far more powerful than had been considered;
and to the &quot;top-down&quot; realization that the numbers of expensive specialized
intelligence-gathering aircraft would be small, while there could be
thousands of JSFs.
<P>
Now the F-35 is seen more as a producer of sensor data, with each aircraft
interacting through high-speed data links with other aircraft to provide
greater &quot;electronic domination of the battlespace&quot;.  If the other aircraft
are F-35s, they will be able to cooperate to provide a capability greater
than the mere sum of the parts.
<P>
The heart of the F-35's sensors is the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-81 radar,
based on the AN/APG-77 &quot;active electronically scanned array (AESA)&quot; developed
for the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor.  An AESA consists of an array of
&quot;transmitter-receiver (T/R)&quot; modules linked by high-speed processors.
Different T/R modules in the array can be allocated to different tasks, with
more modules allocated to tasks that require greater power or sensitivity.
<P>
The F-35's AN/APG-81 provides a range of functions, acting as a multimode
radar; active jamming system; passive electronic defense system; and
communications system.  The system generates signals over a wide range of
frequencies and pulse patterns in an unpredictable fashion to ensure &quot;low
probability of intercept&quot;, allowing the F-35 to &quot;see but not be seen.&quot;  The
AN/APG-81 uses improved technology compared to the F-22's AN/APG-77, but
airframe constraints mean that it has fewer T/R modules, limiting it to about
two-thirds the range (165 kilometers / 90 nautical miles) of the AN/APG-77.
<P>
The F-35 is also fitted with additional sensor systems, including a an
&quot;infrared search and track (IRST)&quot; system for defense and air-to-air combat,
and a targeting system for precision attack on ground targets.
<P>
The IRST system is known as the &quot;distributed aperture infrared system (DAIRS
or DAS)&quot;.  DAS includes six IR sensors mounted on different points of the
fuselage to provide full-sphere IR detection and tracking.  DAS can identify
and pinpoint both incoming missiles and airborne targets.
<P>
Targeting is performed by the &quot;electro-optical targeting system (EOTS)&quot;,
featuring a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) imager; a CCD TV camera; a
targeting laser; and a laser spot tracker.  Unlike typical contemporary
targeting systems, EOTS is not turret-mounted.  It has a wide aperture that
is blended into the aircraft's nose contours, covered by a window that is
opaque to radar, and remains operational through the entire mission.  It is
derived from technology developed for the Lockheed Martin &quot;Sniper&quot; targeting
pod.
<P>
Other avionics include a Northrop Grumman &quot;communication, navigation, and
identification (CNI)&quot; system and a countermeasures suite provided by 
Sanders.

* The F-35's software collects the inputs from all the sensors, as well as
inputs relayed over a high-speed datalink, to provide sensor fusion and
seamless data display.  The software is executed on an &quot;integrated core
processor (ICP)&quot;.  The ICP serves as a central &quot;brain&quot; for the aircraft,
integrating all the other electronics systems and coordinating them for
display to the pilot, and also executing the pilot's commands.  This system
is vitally important, since the F-35 is a single-seat aircraft, and the pilot
needs help to carry out his or her mission.  The processor system is linked
to the aircraft subsystems over a triple-redundant MILSTD 1394B high-speed
serial bus network.
<P>
Northrop Grumman selected a &quot;commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)&quot; processor
system for the ICP.  The F-35 ICP is cheaper than the F-22's &quot;Integrated Core
Processor&quot;, which was designed a decade ago, but is an order of magnitude
more powerful.
<P>
One of the functions of the central processing system is to provide
&quot;automatic target recognition and classification (ATRC)&quot;.  It can often
identify specific targets, and if it can't say exactly what a target is, it
can at least show which targets are different from each other.
<P>
The processing power of the F-35 has presented the electronics system
developers with a formidable software challenge.  The F-22 Raptor uses about
2.5 million lines of software, but the F-35 will use 5.6 million lines of
code.  The F-35 not only has a more advanced electronics system, but it
operates in both air-to-air and air-to-ground modes, and is being built in
three different versions.  The software design strategy is focusing on
modularizing the code so that the portions that are unique to each F-35
variant can be isolated, and the remaining code used as-is on all three
variants.  The portions that are unique to each variant are a minority, about
1.1 million lines.
<P>
In addition, the code is largely executed by an interpretive software layer
known as &quot;middleware&quot; that isolates the code from the specific details of the
processor used.  In principle, this will allow software to be ported to new
processors as they become available, requiring only new middleware and maybe
a few software tweaks.  Interestingly, the code is written in C/C++, strongly
suggesting that the military's effort to create Ada as a standardized
programming language for defense projects was a dead end.
<P>
The current plan is to have a comprehensive but minimal software suite for
F-35 operational introduction, and provide improved releases to bring the
F-35 up to full combat capability.  F-35 electronics system designers hope to
leverage off work done for the F-22 Raptor.
<P>
* The pilot receives inputs from the F-35's electronic systems using an
advanced cockpit layout, featuring a full-panel-width &quot;panoramic cockpit
display (PCD)&quot;, with dimensions of 20 by 50 centimeters (8 by 20 inches),
plus a secondary flight display array.  It does not have a &quot;head-up display&quot;,
however, with this function taken over by a &quot;helmet-mounted display (HMD)&quot;
being developed by Visions Systems International, a collaboration of Kaiser
Electronics and Elbit of Israel.  Symbology and imagery can be displayed on
both the PCD and HMD.  The pilot flies the aircraft with &quot;hands on throttle
and stick (HOTAS)&quot; controls; the PCD is touch-sensitive and functions to an
extent as a reprogrammable keyboard, resulting in a spare cockpit control
layout.
<P>
The &quot;smarts&quot; of the F-35 will be particularly appreciated by pilots flying
the F-35B STOVL version.  Short takeoffs in the Harrier are a troublesome
affair that require the pilot to have &quot;three hands&quot;:  one for the throttle,
one for the stick, and the third for the lever that controls the direction of
the Harrier's swiveling exhaust nozzles.  An F-35B pilot, in contrast, flies
the plane with stick and throttle, with the software handling the fine
details of short takeoff:  the pilot will simply press a &quot;button&quot; on the PCD
to convert from vertical to forward flight or the reverse.
<P>
While the Harrier has reaction control thrusters driven by engine bleed to
provide low-speed maneuverability, the F-35B simply modulates the four points
of its vertical-lift system -- the pivoting exhaust, the two wing exhaust
ducts, and the lift fan -- to provide control.  This trick would be difficult
or impossible to do manually.
<P>
The X-35 prototypes are fitted with a Martin-Baker Mk.16E ejection seat.
Production F-35s are supposed to use a new seat from the &quot;Joint Ejection Seat
Program&quot;.
<P>
* The NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia over Kosovo in the spring of 1999
revealed a shortfall in electronic warfare (EW) capabilities.  EW missions
during the Kosovo campaign relied heavily on the venerable EA-6B Prowler, and
Prowler crews were stretched to the limit.  Although the US Navy is 
adopting the Boeing EF-18G Growler as its replacement, the US Marines
investigated the F-35 as their solution.  
<P>
The conclusion of the investigation was that the Marines were not going to
pursue a two-seat &quot;EF-35&quot; EW variant of the JSF, preferring instead to ensure
that the AESA system designed for the F-35B could operate as a useful EW
system -- possibly assisted by external conformal EW modules when required by
the mission.  This would permit a larger and, on a unit price base, cheaper
buy of F-35Bs, and more flexible operational use of the aircraft.

* In the summer of 2009, some clever people at Lockheed Martin came up with a
set of images of the F-35 rendered in USAF Thunderbirds flight demonstration
team colors.  It was a snappy exercise that attracted considerable attention
online.

The F-35 may well be the last of its breed.  In 2009 Admiral Mike Mullen,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff commented:  &quot;There are those who see
[the F-35] as the last manned fighter-bomber.  And I'm one who's inclined
to believe it, whether it's right or not.&quot;  One wonders what the Thunderbirds
will do when the piloted jet fighter goes out of fashion.  Formation flights
with UAVs might be amusing, but they won't be any replacement.
