 RAAF vs F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter

                                                                                                                      Last Updated: Wed Nov 16 10:11:08 UTC 2011                                                                                                                              Joint Strike Fighter          In 2002 in a surprise decision the then Defence Minister announced that the planned AIR 6000 flyoff to choose Australia's future fighter aircraft was to be effectively stopped, with the developmental Joint Strike Fighter declared to be the preferred aircraft type. The Joint Strike Fighter is not designed to perform air superiority roles, unlike the larger F-22A, and is not well adapted to performing the long range strike role now filled by the F-111. There has been considerable adverse press associated with JSF cost overruns and project delays. This website will post a selection of relevant articles, submissions and papers.        #1 - Joint Strike Fighter Affordability Failure      The JSF program sets new benchmarks for exceeding initially intended Unit Procurement Costs in a weapon system being developed. These publications detail the scope, scale and nature of the program's failure in this area.       Is the JSF Affordable?

These publications detail the scope, scale and nature of the program's failures in these areas.

JSF = Thunderchief II?         [Click for more ...]                The Joint Strike Fighter best compares in its roles and missions, sizing and relative capabilities to the Republic F-105D Thunderchief, the workhorse of the US bombing effort during the Vietnam conflict. What is remarkable is the extent to which a similar roles/missions requirement, defined almost four decades later, produced a combat aircraft of nearly identical size and weight.  Like the F-105, the JSF is not designed to be a top end air superiority fighter, but is designed with was intended to be a robust self defence capability.
