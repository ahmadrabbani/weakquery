The principal of Earl Beatty Public School banned the balls this week after a parent suffered a concussion from being hit in the head with a soccer ball. Students can bring sponge or other soft balls to play with, but soccer balls, footballs, volleyballs and even tennis balls are not allowed for safety reasons, according to a letter sent home on Monday. The ban has rankled some parents who say it's excessive and unfair to children who like to play outside. Chris Stateski, who has a son in Grade 2 and a daughter in Grade 4 at the school, said he was "disgusted" to hear about the ban, which he felt was an overreaction. "A lot of things could happen. A child could trip on the asphalt, a child could fall off the monkey bars and break their arm," said Stateski, who also has a three-year-old. "So many things could happen. What are they going to do â€” cover the schoolyard in pillows and take all the doors off the hinges?" "It's just too much." Anna Caputo, a spokeswoman with Toronto District School Board, said Wednesday that the ban is a temporary solution, brought in as "a proactive and preventive measure." The school has almost 350 students from junior kindergarten to Grade 8 as well as a daycare for younger children, Caputo said, adding the playground is small. "Safety trumps," she said, explaining there had been a few injuries in recent weeks at the school, including the parent who was seriously hurt when hit with the soccer ball and had to be taken to hospital. Stateski said Wednesday he felt bad for the woman who was hurt, but he doesn't feel the whole school should be penalized for one incident. "Unfortunately, it was an accident and accidents do happen," he said, adding he doesn't think the playground is that small. "I think they took this too far." Most people commenting on online news sites and Twitter seemed to feel the same way. "Bubbles for all kids coming soon," tweeted DocSteph. "What's next on the ban list? Fun? Dreams? Rainbows?" asked a tweet from emmamwoolley. Ontario Education Minister Laurel Broten said she stands behind the principal's decision but thinks a balance should be found between keeping kids safe and letting them play. "I get the idea of wanting to ensure that kids are safe. I also know that principals know the lay of the land at their schools," Broten said Wednesday. "I feel confident that the right balance will be found and that we will see a community conversation happen with the principal, with the board and with parents at that school." The principal will be consulting with parents and staff to find a "creative" way to deal with the problem, Caputo said. In the meantime, the school will monitor the situation on the playground.             How does this story make you feel?

All rights reserved. Dennis Manuge stands outside Federal Court in Halifax on Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2011. The former Armed Forces mechanic from Nova Scotia is the representative plaintiff in a class-action The class action alleges the federal government is illegally clawing back the long-term disability insurance benefits of injured veterans. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Andrew Vaughan   Disability benefits for thousands of former Canadian Forces members are being unjustly clawed back because the payments have been unfairly deemed income, lawyers for the veterans argued Wednesday in Federal Court. The veterans, who have launched a class-action suit against the federal government, said their long-term disability benefits are being reduced by the amount of their disability pensions, with some of the most gravely injured not receiving any of their pension. A dozen former military members, some using canes and one in a wheelchair, filed into the courtroom to hear arguments about what constitutes income and whether their monthly stipends should be reduced under their military insurance plan. Ward Branch, a lawyer for one of the claimants, argued the disability benefit they get from Veterans Affairs for injuries sustained in service is for pain and suffering and does not qualify as income. "We say you are certainly not gaining by being paid something to accommodate your disability," he said. "To equate that with the concept of income ... is not a reasonable interpretation." The hearing is looking at whether the government has the legal right to claw back the disability benefit through the military insurance plan and if it is miscalculating the benefit. Under the military insurance plan, injured veterans are entitled to a percentage of their former salaries. But the plan treats monthly pension payments as income and deducts the pension amount from what is paid to them. Some veterans claim they are losing upwards of $3,500 a month in clawbacks. Their lawyers have said thousands of veterans are being subjected to the same practice, putting the cost of stopping it and reimbursing veterans at around $320 million. Dennis Manuge, who was injured in an accident at Canadian Forces Base Petawawa, Ont., just before being deployed to Bosnia in 2001, launched the lawsuit in 2007. It was certified by the Federal Court the following year. Manuge said outside court that his monthly Veterans Affairs pension was reduced by $10,000 in clawbacks between 2003, when he was released from the Forces, and 2005. "It is a pain-and-suffering payment for the non-economic losses associated with acquiring a physical or mental injury," he said. "It is simply not income."

All rights reserved. Lights on an internet switch are lit up as with users in an office in Ottawa, February 10, 2011. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld   The federal telecommunications regulator has rejected a controversial plan that would have allowed the big phone and cable companies to impose a usage-based billing model on Internet service resellers, a system that the Conservative government and many consumers had opposed. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission's decision on Tuesday instead gives the companies a choice of either charging the smaller Internet providers a flat rate per user or selling the ISPs a specific amount of capacity on their networks. "The net effect of it is that there will be no caps, no limitations, no metering of use for retail customers as a result of this CRTC decision," CRTC chairman Konrad von Finckenstein said Tuesday. The decision reverses an earlier plan that would have seen some independent Internet service providers â€” which provide unlimited download services â€” forced to adopt the same pricing model as Bell with limits usage. The regulator launched its review after a social media campaign launched by the ISPs and an ensuing public backlash, as well as urging by former industry minister Tony Clement. "Our original decision was clearly not the best one. It was wrong as was pointed out by a lot of people, including minister Clement. He was right. We have today fixed it. We have made this new decision," von Finckenstein said. Under the new capacity-model for billing, a small ISP buys a certain amount of network capacity from one of the big providers and if its customers unexpectedly increase their usage, their service could slow. "If they buy too little they have a problem with their end customers, if they buy too much they pay for something that they don't use," von Finckenstein said. Industry Minister Christian Paradis said the government would study the CRTC decision carefully to ensure it stimulated competition and investment and allowed Canadians to choose. Canada's largest telecom company has said wholesale independent service providers make up 17 per cent of users in Ontario and Quebec. They also drive 29 per cent of total traffic on Bell's network in those provinces.             How does this story make you feel?

Paulson is currently the deputy commissioner who heads up federal policing for the force and works out of RCMP national headquarters in Ottawa. The bilingual 52-year-old served with the Canadian Forces prior to joining the Mounties 25 years ago. He spent most of his policing career in British Columbia. Paulson has led several high-profile investigations and has also testified before several parliamentary committees including one investigating then-foreign affairs minister Maxime Bernier's handling of sensitive documents. Former RCMP Commissioner William Elliott announced his decision to step down nine months ago, sparking a search for his successor.             How does this story make you feel?

All rights reserved. This Feb. 4, 2008 file photo shows water dripping from a tap in Philadelphia. More than a decade after the Walkerton disaster, much of Canada's tap water remains at risk from contamination despite initial progress in front-line monitoring and treatment, a new report concludes. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP-Matt Rourke   More than a decade after the Walkerton disaster, much of Canada's tap water remains at risk from contamination despite initial progress in front-line monitoring and treatment, a new report concludes. In its third such report released Tuesday, the environmental group Ecojustice warns that while some jurisdictions have stepped up water protection efforts in the past five years, most have not done enough. In 2000, seven people died and 2,500 fell ill in Walkerton, Ont., when the town's poorly monitored drinking water was contaminated with E. coli from farm runoff. The tragedy prompted most provinces to review and revamp their drinking water laws with mixed results, but that burst of enthusiasm has faded in recent years, according to the report. "In many places, the health of Canadians is still at risk," the report concludes. "The lack of recent progress also seems to indicate that the impetus for improved water protection, spurred by events like Walkerton, is on the wane." The report called "Waterproof 3" finds only Ontario among the provinces worthy of an A grade for its water protection efforts, while Alberta lags with a C-minus. The federal government gets an F for a record that continues to worsen, the report states. In particular, the report criticizes Ottawa for a lack of progress on the legislative front, poor water quality for First Nations, and budget cuts it says will hurt Environment Canada's ability to monitor the situation. "The federal government is failing in almost every aspect of water protection, even though it should be setting rigorous standards," the report says. In response, Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Duncan told the House of Commons the Conservative government was working with First Nations on water issues. "We will be reintroducing First Nations water legislation soon to create endorsable standards and guide investments," Duncan said. For the first time, the report has expanded to include source-water protection efforts, the idea that the best way to provide safe tap water is to ensure the water does not get contaminated in the first place. The findings are not encouraging. "Full-fledged source-water protection, a critical first step in achieving safe drinking water systems, has been implemented to some degree in only seven of 13 provinces and territories," the report states. "(It) is notably lacking in industry-heavy areas where the risk of contamination is high." According to the report, Prince Edward Island leads when it comes to protecting water sources. Almost everyone getting tap water from systems covered by legally binding source-water protection plans. On the downside, the province does not mandate water treatment. Alberta has no legislation in place to protect water sources, and its standards for testing and treatment have not changed in five years, the report finds. The report praises Ontario for implementing "the most ambitious source-water protection program" in the country and having the tough standards for treatment, testing, operator training and public reporting. Canadians living in rural and remote areas are most vulnerable to the "alarming deficiency" when it comes to warnings about contaminated water, the report finds. B.C. Environment Minister Terry Lake said his province faces geographical challenges providing water to many of its remote and outlying communities. But he said the report indicates British Columbia is making progress. "In urban areas like Metro Vancouver, the Capital Regional District and cities like Kamloops, Kelowna and Prince George, it's a lot easier to provide water at a very high level of quality than it is in the vast, remote regions of British Columbia. That's where it's a challenge," Lake said.             How does this story make you feel?

As police looked on, bylaw officers threaded their way between tents and through the mud to put up the notices, which were quickly taken down. "I will be standing my ground here," said Hannah Kovacs, 22, as he burned one of the pieces of paper. "If they want me to leave, they'll have to kill me first." The notices warned that occupation of St. James Park between the hours of midnight and 5 a.m. and erecting structures in the facility contravened city laws. There was no immediate word on when the city would act on its threat to clear out the tents and other makeshift structures. In a statement later Tuesday, the protesters said the city could not "evict an idea" whose time had come and said they planned to stay. "We reaffirm our right to the use of public space to assemble, peacefully protest, and establish collective dialogue on issues that affect us all," the statement said. "These rights are guaranteed to all of us." But some demonstrators said they would leave rather than risk confrontation with police and possible criminal charges. "It seems like a silly thing to be risking my clean record for," Tim Topping said as he packed up his tent. "I'd still be willing to help, but from the outside," said the 23-year-old, who has spent almost a month in the park. The protesters took over the park several blocks east of Bay Street on Oct. 15 as part of the Occupy movement that began on Wall Street to decry corporate greed and the growing gap between haves and have-nots. The initial handful of tents that weekend quickly expanded to a mini-village with a library, media centre, medical facility and food and logistics areas. "The city recognizes the rights of Canadians to gather and protest," city manager Joe Pennachetti said in an open letter to the protesters. "However, the city has determined that it cannot allow the current use of St. James Park to continue." The letter went on to warn that the city will take the "necessary steps" to remove the tents and other structures if the demonstrators don't do so themselves. About a dozen Toronto councillors said the city was moving too quickly. In a letter to Mayor Rob Ford, they urged no action be taken until the issue had been discussed by council in two weeks. About two dozen people staged a sit-in outside city hall late Tuesday afternoon to express their opposition to the eviction notices. Activist Taylor Chelsea said one option was to consider a court challenge. "Does constitutional law supersede bylaw?" Chelsea said. "We're working with lawyers to figure that out right now." Police spokesman Mark Pugash said officers were on hand to keep the peace as the bylaw officers did their business. It would be up to the city to decide when to clear out the park or if police would be needed. Police did arrest two men when about two dozen protesters marched in downtown Toronto Tuesday in support of Occupy Wall Streeters who had been cleared from a Manhattan park overnight. They gathered outside Brookfield Properties, which owns Zuccotti Park near Wall Street. The arrested men were aged 29 and 47. Both were charged with assaulting a peace officer. Across the country, cities have made it clear their patience with the demonstrations has worn thin. Some, such as Halifax, London, Ont., and Saskatoon have already evicted their Occupy protesters. In Regina, police ticketed seven people late Monday night for being in Victoria Park in violation of city bylaws. In Calgary, protesters in Olympic Plaza sang "Kumbaya" on Tuesday as officers handed out bylaw tickets giving them 24 hours to leave after the city-issued deadline to empty the park passed. In other cities, groups have defied requests or orders to leave. In Vancouver, city workers removed several tents and tarps, enforcing a court order to bring the site in line with fire safety bylaws. The city planned to ask B.C. Supreme Court on Wednesday for an injunction to clear the camp. The City of Victoria was also in court Tuesday seeking an injunction to evict Occupy campers. The case was adjourned until Thursday to allow the demonstrators more time to prepare. In Montreal, authorities said they had no plans to remove downtown protesters. "As long as there's no crime and as long as there are no excesses ... we will tolerate the tents here," said police Insp. Marc St-Cyr. Meanwhile, Canadian folk legend Gordon Lightfoot stopped by the Toronto park to visit his 17-year-old daughter. Too many young people face a bleak economic future, he said. "What's going to happen to our kids?" asked Lightfoot, whose daughter came down with pneumonia while occupying the park. "I really admire these folks here in Toronto." Toronto's deputy mayor Doug Holyday said the city was hoping most people would leave without violence or arrests. "That's probably a tall order but that's what we're still hoping for," Holyday said. The mayor was not immediately available to comment. But last week Ford said it was time for the protesters to move on because businesses and taxpayers have been complaining.

Deena Caputo told a fatality inquiry that her common-law husband, Jeffrey Bostick, was like a zombie when he toured the group home on Sept. 22, 2009. She said the home had magnetic doors to lock children in their rooms. "His eyes were glossed over. He wasn't human," Caputo testified Tuesday. "It's like he snapped. He didn't say a word, not one word." A week later, Bostick and his 11-year-old son, Jeremy, were found dead inside a barricaded bedroom in the basement of their north Edmonton home. A cylinder of carbon monoxide was in the room and the door and air vent were sealed with duct tape and wet towels. Caputo detailed to the court the family's constant fight to get help for the boy. She said they moved in 2006 to Alberta from Ontario so Bostick, heavily in debt, could find work and have access to better programs for children with disabilities. Besides Jeremy, who was her stepson, she had a biological son with attention deficit disorder and oppositional defiant disorder. But Jeremy remained the biggest challenge, she said, and it was a constant struggle over the next few years to get help. "It was always a waiting list. It was always an availability issue. It was like pulling teeth to get any type of service." She said workers who came to their home either couldn't come back because of funding problems or refused to work with Jeremy because he was so violent. At school, he was in a special class for children with behavioural problems. He once attacked three classmates and a teacher and was admitted to hospital. He was sent to hospital another time when he tried to smash his head into the car window on the way to school. He was drugged and strapped to a bed for 36 hours, said Caputo. She said one doctor suggested that if the family couldn't handle the child, they should put him up for adoption. Caputo recalled how shortly after the last emergency room visit, in 2008, Jeremy got a bed in a private facility on weekdays. He had two workers during the day and seemed to be doing well. But it cost up to $32,000 a month to keep him there, and the province wanted to move him to a group home. Caputo said she and Jeremy's dad were concerned that he would hurt himself or others in a group setting. Dr. Keith Goulden, a pediatrician specializing in autism, testified Jeremy had a severe form of autism combined with an intellectual disability. He was off and on medications, including tranquillizers. Goulden said autism is a frustrating and stressful disorder for families to deal with because there is no treatment. Educational supports offer the best solution. "All of us have a breaking point," Goulden said. "All of us can get to the edge of whatever cliff that is." He added that he's not proud of the respite care the Alberta government offers for families dealing with an autistic child. "But it is what it is."             How does this story make you feel?

About two dozen Occupy protesters were marching in support of demonstrators who were cleared from a New York City park overnight. THE CANADIAN PRESS/James MacDonald   The process of clearing protesters out of a downtown Toronto park started today as bylaw officers delivered eviction notices to the members of the Occupy movement. Officers walked among the tents at St. James Park handing the notices to protesters who have been camped out for a month. They affixed the notices to empty tents. A small number of police officers were on hand watching the proceedings. It happened shortly after about two dozen protesters marched in downtown Toronto in support of demonstrators who were cleared from a New York City park overnight. They gathered at a building that houses Brookfield Properties, which owns the park from which protesters were cleared in New York. Police say one of the Toronto marchers was arrested but there were no details. It's not clear when the Toronto protesters might leave the park. Mayor Rob Ford has said he expects the demonstrators to move peacefully. In New York, Mayor Michael Bloomberg says Zuccotti Park was cleared out and cleaned up in the middle of the night "to reduce the risk of confrontation.'' Bloomberg says the city had planned to allow the protesters back, but they would not be allowed to use tents or sleeping bags. Other cities, such as Halifax, London, Ont., and Saskatoon, have evicted their Occupy protesters. Groups in other cities, such as Vancouver, have remained defiant of requests or orders to leave.             How does this story make you feel?

All rights reserved. Shooting Edge range officer Patrick Deegan displays long guns at the store in Calgary, on Sept. 15, 2010. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh   Scrapping the requirement to register rifles and shotguns could fuel illegal firearms trafficking across the Canadian border, warns an internal federal memo. It says the move would weaken import controls by eliminating a requirement for border officials to verify firearms coming into the country. "Such a loophole could facilitate unregistered prohibited and restricted firearm trafficking into and through Canada," says the declassified memo, originally marked secret. The memo was released under the Access to Information Act to the National Firearms Association and posted along with hundreds of other pages on the organization's website. It was prepared by Mark Potter, a senior Public Safety Department official, for an assistant deputy minister as Parliament was debating a private member's bill to kill the registry. That bill was narrowly defeated in the House of Commons last year. Upon winning re-election with a majority, the Conservatives made legislation to end the long-gun registry a priority. The bill introduced last month would halt registration of long guns and permanently delete more than seven million files on gun ownership. Many police, health and victims' groups oppose the move, while anglers and hunters welcome plans for the registry's demise. The Tories argue the registration of long guns is wasteful and unnecessary, although they support the licensing of gun owners and the registration of prohibited and restricted weapons, including handguns. The internal Public Safety memo comes to light as Public Safety Minister Vic Toews plans to appear before a Commons committee Tuesday on the federal bill. The memo notes that businesses and individuals who have a valid firearms licence and supporting documentation may import non-restricted firearms such as common hunting rifles into Canada  a process administered by the Canada Border Services Agency. Firearms brought into Canada must go through a verification process, to ensure people have the proper licensing privileges to possess the gun they're importing. Verification, the responsibility of the RCMP-administered Canadian Firearms Program, involves providing a detailed description of the firearm and in some cases may entail a physical inspection. The memo says the border services agency is "neither trained nor required to verify firearms," and the requirement would disappear along with the long-gun registry. As a result, says the document, restricted or prohibited weapons could be brought into Canada  either intentionally or otherwise under the guise of unrestricted guns. Blair Hagen, a spokesman for the firearms association, said eliminating the registry will not mean looser controls on guns at the border. "Just because there is not an individual registration assigned to that firearm any more does not mean it is not controlled and that there's not a record of it entering Canada. There will still be a record of it entering Canada if it's done legally," he said. "I think they're alleging that some people will try to fudge it a bit to get illegal guns into Canada and, frankly, that's offensive." The Public Safety memo also says elimination of the registry would "significantly compromise" law enforcement's ability to trace firearms in Canada for instance, linking a weapon left at a crime scene with an individual owner or to support foreign police forces trying to do the same. "In such a scenario, Canada would no longer meet its international commitments relating to firearms tracing and record keeping."               share  top of page    Decriminalizing euthanasia in Ottawa  by The Canadian Press - Story: 67292 Nov 15, 2011 / 6:07 am  A long-awaited experts' report on how Canada and Canadian families handle the end of life calls on the federal government to decriminalize euthanasia and assisted suicide. And if Ottawa won't co-operate, the panel says provinces should go it alone, by making clear they won't prosecute health-care professionals involved in assisted dying. "Assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia should be legally permitted for competent individuals who make a free and informed decision that their life is no longer worth living," says the report by the Royal Society of Canada's expert panel on end-of-life decision-making. The report was two years in the making. It brought together a panel of experts on medicine, philosophy, ethics and health to look at what is being done in other countries, examine Canadian practices and sentiments, and formulate recommendations. The panel was meant to be neutral, to inform rational debate and lead to solid policy in an area that is always emotional and controversial. But the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition of Ontario dismissed the report before it was even public, saying at least one of the panel members is a noted euthanasia advocate. "When we further investigated the panel members it was clear that ... this report would be a pro-euthanasia propaganda report," the group said in a news release Monday. But the panel says that Canadians are overwhelmingly in favour of finding an even-handed way to allow voluntary assisted suicide but would not permit anything involuntary. "We carefully considered Canadian values, international experience in permissive regimes, and legal and ethical aspects of these practices and came to the unanimous conclusion that Canada should have a permissive yet carefully regulated and monitored system with respect to assisted death," the report says. In Canada and other countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are against the law, it happens anyway, said panel member Jocelyn Downie. She said that while euthanasia is clearly illegal in Canada, several other laws dealing with what doctors can and cannot do toward the end of a patient's life are unclear. Indeed, the Supreme Court of British Columbia is holding hearings this week into whether doctors can help terminally ill patients die if the patients insist. Controversy surrounding euthanasia aside, the main thrust of the Royal Society of Canada report was to stress that Canadian governments, institutions and families alike are doing a rotten job in preparing for death and dying. "People simply do not talk and do not plan enough for the end of life," said Udo Schuklenk, a Queen's University philosophy professor who chaired the panel. The panel urged far more attention to palliative care, living wills and public education about how to prepare advance directives for a patient's own health care. Only a third of Canadians have any kind of advance directive, while fewer than half have designated someone who could act on their behalf, the report said. And just one in 10 has discussed the dying process with a doctor. Palliative-care professionals are too focused on cancer patients and need to expand their expertise, the report urged. The panel also dismissed the use of the word 'dignity' in discussions about the end of life. The word is abused by both sides of the euthanasia debate, and is too vague to do anyone any good, the report says. Rather, in a desperate search to find some kind of common ground that would allow for a calm and respectful discussion on the end of life, the panel focused on 'autonomy' instead, said ethicist Daniel Weinstock from the University of Montreal. The bottom line, he said, is that people want to be able to decide for themselves what will be done to them in their final days.               share  top of page    Our drinking water at risk   by The Canadian Press - Story: 67291 Nov 15, 2011 / 6:05 am   More than a decade after the Walkerton disaster, much of Canada's tap water remains at risk from contamination despite initial progress in front-line monitoring and treatment, a new report concludes. In its third such report released Tuesday, the environmental group Ecojustice warns that while some jurisdictions have stepped up water protection efforts in the past five years, most have not done enough. In 2000, seven people died and 2,500 fell ill in Walkerton, Ont., when the town's poorly monitored drinking water was contaminated with E. coli from farm runoff. The tragedy prompted most provinces to review and revamp their drinking water laws with mixed results but that burst of enthusiasm has faded in recent years, according to the report. "In many places, the health of Canadians is still at risk," the report concludes. "The lack of recent progress also seems to indicate that the impetus for improved water protection, spurred by events like Walkerton, is on the wane." The report called "Waterproof 3" finds only Ontario among the provinces worthy of an A grade for its water protection efforts, while Alberta lags with a C-. The federal government gets an F for a record that continues to worsen, the report states. In particular, the report criticizes Ottawa for a lack of progress on the legislative front, poor water quality for First Nations, and budget cuts it says will hurt Environment Canada's ability to monitor the situation. "The federal government is failing in almost every aspect of water protection, even though it should be setting rigorous standards," the report says. For the first time, the report has expanded to include source-water protection efforts the idea that the best way to provide safe tap water is to ensure the water does not get contaminated in the first place. The findings are not encouraging. "Full-fledged source-water protection  a critical first step in achieving safe drinking water systems has been implemented to some degree in only seven of 13 provinces and territories," the report states. "(It) is notably lacking in industry-heavy areas where the risk of contamination is high." The report praises Ontario for implementing "the most ambitious source-water protection program" in the country and having the tough standards for treatment, testing, operator training and public reporting. Canadians living in rural and remote areas are most vulnerable to the "alarming deficiency" when it comes to warnings about contaminated water, the report finds. Overall, the report concludes, the biggest threats have shifted over the past decade from deficiencies in front-line water protection to unprotected source water, climate change and government cuts.               share  top of page    Rich households, the biggest polluters  by The Canadian Press - Story: 67288 Nov 15, 2011 / 5:55 am  A new study says the richest 20 per cent of Canadian households spew almost twice  or 1.8 times  the greenhouse-gas emissions of the country's lowest income-earners. The study by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives finds household carbon footprints increase with income and concludes that reduction policies must reflect that inequality. The report's author, economist Marc Lee, says the rich can reduce emissions by taking steps like cutting air travel and investing in home energy efficiency  more easily than low-income families, without affecting basic needs. The report says the top one per cent of households had emissions three times the average and almost six times those of households in the bottom 10 per cent. The study also finds the top one per cent of income-earners were responsible for almost double the greenhouse-gas emissions of the next four per cent of households. Lee says climate policies have to be fair to be effective, and he contends high-income Canadians should bear the greater burden of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.               share  top of page   top of page       Pipeline on hold, for now  by The Canadian Press - Story: 67285 Nov 14, 2011 / 8:33 pm  Photo: The Canadian Press. All rights reserved. The corporate logo of TransCanada Corp.(TSX:TRP) is shown. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO   TransCanada Corp. said Monday it has reached an agreement with the Nebraska government to change the route of its proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline in order to avoid the ecologically sensitive Sandhills region. The Calgary-based pipeline giant (TSX:TRP) said it supports legislation Nebraska has introduced to ensure the pipeline doesn't cross the expanse of grass-strewn, loose-soil hills, and part of the Ogallala aquifer, which supplies water to Nebraska and seven other states. The 2,700-kilometre pipeline, if built, will carry crude from Alberta's oilsands to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast, traversing six states along the way. Some of the most heated environmental opposition to the pipeline has come from Nebraska, where many residents were concerned a spill from the pipeline could pollute water they rely on for farming and ranching. On Thursday, the U.S. State Department heeded those concerns, announcing it would delay its decision on Keystone XL until early 2013 so that the company could come up with a new route. The U.S. State Department has final say on Keystone XL because it would cross an international border. Alex Pourbaix, TransCanada's president of energy and oil pipelines, said he expects the extra review will add six to nine months to the Keystone XL schedule, a vast improvement from the 12 to 18 months the State Department had earlier expected. "As long as we're able to stay on the shorter time-frame, that keeps costs down very significantly," he said in an interview with the Canadian Press from Lincoln, Neb. However, a State Department official familiar with the process told The Associated Press a federal decision will still likely take 12 to 18 months. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because no final decision has been made. TransCanada is Canada's largest natural gas shipper and the biggest gas distributor in the country. It is also growing its other energy businesses, including power generation and oil transportation, with Keystone XL one of the biggest projects in the company's history.

Douglas Hugh Stewart, 52, of Moncton pleaded guilty earlier to possessing, accessing and distributing child pornography. Judge Anne Dugas-Horsman said police found more than 4.5 million images and videos depicting child sexual abuse during a search of Stewart's home. He lived in his father's basement. Investigators also found another 1.2 million images of children in the nude. "There were images of children who appeared as young as three," Dugas-Horsman said during sentencing. "The videos were often more graphic than the images." Stewart was arrested in March as part of an RCMP crackdown on Internet child pornography. Operation J Treasures investigated peer-to-peer computer file sharing of child sexual abuse images. The court was told that as Stewart downloaded the files, they could be accessed by others, and that's how police were able to gather their initial evidence. It took police more than 700 hours just to catalogue the items. Dugas-Horsman said Stewart started his collection in the mid-1980s and told police he knew what he was doing was illegal. She described the images as "crime scene photos" and said that "to be used and exploited in such a manner steals the spirit and deadens the soul." "The children depicted are real and exist somewhere on the planet." Dugas-Horsman added that sentencing must be of such deterrence that possession of such material would not be worth the risk. The RCMP's lead investigator, Const. Tonia Williams, said outside court that she hoped the sentence sends that message to the public. She called the case just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the global problem. "Worldwide it is a challenge for all law enforcement agencies," Williams said. "That's why partnerships between all law enforcement agencies are very important." Defence lawyer Maurice Blanchard said his client expected to get the sentence that he did. A previous case in Ontario involving 1.3 million images resulted in a four-year sentence, so Blanchard said Monday's sentence sets a new benchmark.             How does this story make you feel?

Marg Brownoff, registrar for the South Side Athletic Club Midget AA team, says the incident happened Saturday afternoon and that the player was apparently trying to block a shot. Brownoff says the player was on life support during the night, but died Sunday morning. A spokesman for Alberta Health Services, however, says the teen was still alive as of early Sunday afternoon. Greg Kennedy says he cannot make any further comments on the boy's current status because the parents have withdrawn their consent for the release of information.

All rights reserved. Jean-Francois Pelland is shown in this October 2010 handout photo taken in Malaysia.THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Warren Burrell   To his friends he was an avid traveller and an ideal ambassador for Canada, to his students the man known simply as "Mr Jeff" was a passionate role model. Those who knew Jean Francois Pelland spent the weekend expressing their shock and sadness after the 34-year-old died of gunshot wounds in an Egyptian hospital. "He will be greatly missed by everyone here," his co-workers at Cairo's British Columbia Canadian International School said in a statement issued Sunday. "During his short time here, he had a significant impact on all of us." Pelland, a teacher who became vice-principal of the school this August, died on Friday, two days after men fired on his car thinking it was carrying members of a rival tribe. His employer said the "naturally friendly" Montrealer was touring southern Egypt in a taxi with a friend when shots were fired after their driver refused to stop for an illegal road block in the Sohag area, near Luxor. After surgery to remove his spleen and repair his intestinal tract at a hospital in Luxor, Pelland died due to complications from his injuries. "His love for children, his enthusiasm, his energy and his willingness to do what needed to be done to ensure that every student could be successful was just part of what the students and teachers enjoyed and will miss," the school said. Pelland's death highlighted the family feuds and revenge attacks which are common in southern Egypt, where many families take the law into their own hands and refuse police intervention. Warren Burrell, who worked with Pelland when the two were teaching at a school in Malaysia a few years ago, said his friend's death seemed to be a case of being in the "wrong place, wrong time." Burrell said the situation which lead to Pelland's death touring a part of southern Egypt was exactly the kind of the thing the Montrealer did with his spare time. "He never sat still for a minute," Burrell said. "He loved life, he just wanted to see the world and make it a better place. The students all loved him." Canada's Foreign Affairs Department said it was aware of media reports concerning a Canadian citizen in Egypt and that consular staff were working on the matter, "offering assistance as appropriate." Pelland's school said the Canadian Embassy sent a representative to the Luxor hospital "in a timely manner to assist during this difficult time." Some of Pelland's students took to the Internet to express their dismay and remorse over the news of his death. One blogger remembered Pelland as a passionate teacher who wore his ice hockey gear to host Talent Nights. "He was fun, daring, adventurous," wrote the student. "He has taught us to be fearless and remain passionate. May he rest in peace."               share  top of page    Coming home   by The Canadian Press - Story: 67245 Nov 13, 2011 / 10:54 am  Photo: The Canadian Press. All rights reserved. Kerry-Lynn Arnold lays wreath at cenotaph at Kandahar Airfield on Oct.4, 2010. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Montpetit   Memorials to Canada's war dead are coming home. Soldiers at Kandahar Airfield are taking apart the white marble cenotaph that bears the names and likenesses of the Canadians who have lost their lives as part of the mission in Afghanistan. "It's a sense of profound pride that these soldiers are taking this apart and having the opportunity to repatriate some of the faces and names of our 158 fallen," said Lt.-Col. Mark Flint, who is leading the team of engineers who are packing up the cenotaph. The cenotaph has long been a sombre fixture at the airfield, located behind the two-storey Canadian headquarters and a few paces from the spot where tents for journalists once stood. A team of engineers is packing up the 158 black granite etchings of every Canadian killed as part of the Afghan mission. The plaques and the marble structure will be shipped back to Canada, where they will remain in storage until the military and politicians decide what to do with them. The Defence Department has said it plans to erect a new monument in the Ottawa area. One spot the military is apparently considering is Beechwood Cemetery in the city's east end, which is already home to the national military cemetery where many veterans are buried. Work began Saturday morning, a day after people gathered at the monument to mark Canada's last Remembrance Day in Kandahar. By noon, nearly every plaque had been removed and carefully laid in large wooden crates. The high-pitched scream of circular saws could be heard outside the Canadian compound as engineers cut into the marble structure. The precise placement of every plaque was dutifully recorded so the monument can be rebuilt exactly the same in Canada. One piece of the monument won't return home just yet. A jagged chunk of rock will be sent back to Kabul to serve as a temporary memorial for the Canadians who serve as part of the NATO training mission. Insurgents used that rock to divert a vehicle carrying Cpl. Robbie Beerenfenger and Sgt. Robert Short over a deadly land mine in October 2003. "The significance of that rock is pretty important, and we're going to repatriate it to Kabul until further notice," Flint said. Taking apart the cenotaph is a small piece of a larger, highly complicated puzzle. "This is an important aspect of doing these types of missions," said Brig.-Gen. Chuck Lamarre, who is leading a contingent of about 1,000 soldiers who are packing up and moving the remnants of a decade of war. "And this one in particular, there's an emotional aspect to it that is moving," Lamarre said. "We want to make sure that we take this back so that Canadians back home can get an appreciation of not only the work that was done by their soldiers here, but also the sacrifice." The Canadian Forces have taken down more than 200 structures at Kandahar Airfield and moved 1,800 sea containers and close to 1,000 vehicles as the deadline to pull out of southern Afghanistan draws near. The military expects to be completely out of Kandahar Airfield by mid-December.               share  top of page    Resort ravaged by fire  by The Canadian Press - Story: 67241 Nov 13, 2011 / 8:40 am  Crews were still snuffing out stubborn hot spots Sunday at a popular resort on Nova Scotia's south coast that was burned to the ground by a massive fire a day earlier. Firefighters were dousing outbreaks at the White Point Beach Resort, an historic inn that was a social cornerstone and cultural hub for the small communities that dot the province's south coast. RCMP Staff Sgt. Jeff Wells said he hoped officials would be able to get in sometime Sunday to try to determine the cause once the flames were extinguished. But, he said the sprawling wooden structure that was built in 1928 and housed the kitchen, conference centre, pool and some of the guest rooms was gone. "The main building is lost," he said. "The fire is, for the most part, beat down...They're fighting hot spots, but it's nothing major as compared to what it was last night with mountains of flames." He said it's not yet clear what caused the fire, but early indications are that it started in the basement of the 83-year-old seaside hotel. There were no injuries, with staff and guests including several kids' hockey teams and a wedding party getting out safely after the fire was detected in the early afternoon. Wells says the main building, which had a conference centre, guest rooms, a restaurant and pool, was lost in the flames that were kicked up quickly by high winds in the wooden structure. Fire officials say they were called to the blaze at about 2:30 p.m. Saturday and found the lobby filled with smoke. High winds fed the flames that quickly engulfed the building. Darlene Norman, a councillor for the region of Queens municipality, said she could see the flames and billowing black smoke from several kilometres away as she headed to the resort Saturday. She said the hotel, with its trademark log cabins that stretch along a wide sand beach, was key to the area economy and the community as a vacation and music spot. "It's the cultural heart of this community," she said from her home in nearby Liverpool. "It's a devastating blow emotionally to the staff ... Everyone's pretty shocked and shaken." The resort was built as a private hunting and fishing lodge, starting with a few cabins, an eight-room main lodge and a dining room. Over the years, the hotel expanded with tennis courts and a golf course. The resort was to undergo renovations early next year. It was home to over 100 employees.
