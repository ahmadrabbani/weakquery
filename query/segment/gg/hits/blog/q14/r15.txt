I put "accident" in quotes in the title because I don't classify such events as an accident. Anytime a person is shot while hunting, it can almost always be traced back to a failure in judgment or lack of skill. The only exceptions are when something like 'tripping on a log" or the like occurs. I have always been adamant in my positions about safe hunting, including not pulling the trigger unless I am absolutely sure what I am shooting at, as well as what else might be in the line of fire. So if what happened when the Vice President was hunting quail with his friend isn't from tripping or the like, than it must be the result of poor judgment or a lack of skill and/or training. And the bad judgment continued, when it was decided to keep it all secret for awhile. Then all the speculations make a person think that maybe they are possible. Was he drunk? Were they waiting to see if the victim would make it? Now, it doesn't matter if they are true or not, because the V.P. waited so long.    1  2   Next Page    Published by  Jeff Musall - Featured Contributor in Sports  Jeff Musall has a passion for writing, a knack for frank and informed expression, and a desire to engage the minds of readers.
