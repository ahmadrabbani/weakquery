Every liberal rag has the "breaking news" about Dick Cheney accidentally shooting a man while he was hunting. I can understand mentioning the story, but it's not something that should be on the front pages. It's not a big deal. Hunting accidents are common. It's a good thing they were hunting quail or else that guy might have been worse off. Liberals use anything they can these days to bash conservatives. Liberals are actually more obnoxious when they're not in power.             About Contact  Advertise  Jobs  Site News  More...
