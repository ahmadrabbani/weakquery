Good news, good news today -- so far Dick Cheney has not shot anybody." --David Letterman "Everybody is in the Valentine's mood. For example, earlier today Dick Cheney shot his buddy in the ass with an arrow." --David Letterman "The guy Cheney shot is a Texas lawyer. While he was lying there on the ground he actually handed himself his own business card." --Jay Leno "After Whittington had a heart attack, Cheney said, "You big baby. I get those all the time. Walk it off." --Jay Leno "It turns out now that Dick Cheney did not have a license to hunt, and coincidentally, turns out we didn't have a license to go into Iraq." --David Letterman "Remember when the most embarrassing thing to happen to a vice-president was misspelling the word potato?" --Jimmy Kimmel "Police are still investigating. They want to know why Cheney was unable to see the hunter at the time of the accident. And, they also want to know how Cheney wound up with his wallet." --Jimmy Kimmel "The administration has been getting a lot of criticism for how they handled the situation. First, they didn't tell the media for almost a full day after it happed. The White House press corps was furious. They expect to be told when the vice president shoots a 78-year-old man in the face." --Jimmy Kimmel "If this story gets any bigger, pretty soon they're going to have to tell the president." --David Letterman "When the ambulance got there, out of force of habit they put Cheney on the stretcher. No, the other guy!" --Jay Leno "Dick Cheney is capitalizing on this for Valentine's Day. It's the new Dick Cheney cologne. It's called Duck!" --Jay Leno "The guy who got gunned down, he is a Republican lawyer and a big Republican donor and fortunately the buck shot was deflected by wads of laundered cash. So he's fine. He took a little in the wallet." --David Letterman "This is a great story. You've got the Vice President, a shotgun, a bunch of rich guys hunting tiny little birds. The only thing that could possibly make this story better is if he shot Michael Jackson." --Jimmy Kimmel "So in summary, the Vice President of the United States shot a 78-year-old man in the face. Congratulations Mister Vice President, you are now a Crip." --Jimmy Kimmel "He is a lawyer and he got shot in the face. But he's a lawyer, he can use his other face. He'll be all right." --Craig Ferguson "You can understand why this lawyer fellow let his guard down, because if you're out hunting with a politician, you think, 'If I'm going to get it, it's going to be in the back.'" --Craig Ferguson "The big scandal apparently is that they didn't release the news for 18 hours. I don't think that's a scandal at all. I'm quite pleased about that. Finally there's a secret the vice president's office can keep." --Craig Ferguson "Apparently the reason they didn't release the information right away is they said we had to get the facts right. That's never stopped them in the past." --Craig Ferguson  Read More Late-Night Jokes About Dick Cheney    Previous  1  2  3  Next  Cheney's Hunting Accident Cheney Shooting Humor: Main Index    Dick Cheney Humor Dick Cheney Humor: Main Index  Funny Dick Cheney Pictures  Dick Cheney Jokes    More Late-Night Jokes Today's Late-Night Jokes  Late-Night Joke Archive    Related Articles Dick Cheney Shooting Jokes - Cheney Late-Night Jokes  Cheney Late-Night Political Humor - Dick Cheney Jokes  Dick Cheney Jokes - Late-Night Jokes About Dick Cheney  CIA Leak Scandal Jokes - Plamegate Jokes        Daniel Kurtzman Political Humor Guide  Sign up for My Newsletter   Headlines  Forum         Related Searches  dick cheney  jimmy kimmel  david letterman  jay leno  valentine s day  word potato  Explore Political Humor Must Reads Political Humor Today  Best Political Cartoons  Funniest Pics of All Time  Best Occupy Wall Street Signs  Late-Night Jokes   Most Popular 2011 Political Cartoons - Best Political Cartoons of 2011  Funniest Political Protest Signs of All Time - Funny Politic…  Funny Photo Ops - When Political Photo Ops Go Horribly Awry  Occupy Wall Street Signs - Funny Occupy Protest Signs  GOP Presidential Campaign Cartoons - Best Cartoons on Republ…    See More About: dick cheney  late-night jokes  politicians gone wild    By Category Barack Obama  Political Cartoons  Funny Pictures  2012 Election Jokes  Late Night / SNL  Funny Political Jokes  Funny Political Quotes  Quizzes & Games  Tea Party  Occupy Wall Street  George W.
