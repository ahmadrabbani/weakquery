 my edit.: Hunting Season

      skip to main  |  skip to sidebar          Sunday, October 30, 2011   Hunting Season                         Jacket?  Ralph Lauren, thrifted   Plaid shirt?  Ali & Kris, Winners   Jeans?  J Brand, Lovestory, Winners ( here for lots more money but they are great jeans!)   Bracelets?  Thrifted and from  the crazy lady at The Ex    Hat?  Maria Paola Culugi, Style Sense   Purse?  Filene's Basement     I'm a big fan of my new hat. It's a hat made for the city. The faux fur pom is so ridiculously over sized that I could get mistaken for wildlife in the country and one hike during the hunting season would be the end of me. These pictures may look like they were taken in a forest (one with wooden fences, of course) but rest assured that I was safely in an inner city park.  I hope you had an nice Halloween weekend. I didn't do too much but I watched my instagram feed (yes, I caved and joined instagram... find me at  myeditblog if you want to see a lot of cat pictures) clog with Halloween costumes all weekend and I felt a little left out. Until I realised that   I was wearing the best costume of all.  With this hat I'm clearly Dick Cheney's hunting partner  on that fateful day  in 2006...      *thanks to my little friend Elisha for taking my pics. I liked so many I broke my own rule of having 6 pics absolute maximum...     Posted by  myedit   at   9:48 PM                                35 comments:        Jas said...

Great outfit! :)    October 31, 2011 12:44 PM               Linda said...  that hat is soooo great, but that first picture made me think you cut your hair into spikes! scared me a little. but then i came to my senses and realized that it was just the hat and it was fabulous. and that you're wearing double plaid and elbow patches!

When I first looked at the top picture, it looked like the pom on your hat was your hair- cut bizarrely short on top, mullet style...

I am smitten by this jacket. It's so sharp-looking and chic and the pom-pom hat is adorable. A very elegant fall look, if I do say so myself :)    November 3, 2011 1:49 PM               Nikell said...  Found you via Kendi's Blog. I love this outfit. I'm going to follow you via bloglovin.

Kidding, about the President part, not about not being able to remember the PM's name.    November 5, 2011 5:39 PM                Nuha said...  I am in love with this outfit!
