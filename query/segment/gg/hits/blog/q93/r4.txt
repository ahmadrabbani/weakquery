Viruses are computer programs that replicate themselves and can attack other computers. These virus can cause serious damage by erasing programs that will prevent a computer from working properly. Getting rid of viruses can be simple or complex depending on the nature of the virus. Not everyone is computer savvy enough to pull their system back from the brink of destruction, this is where the boys in black come into play. Basically they are “geeks” for hire. Isn’t that what you need when your system explodes. A proud computer geek who is not only proud of his geekiness but willing to share his unique calling with you at any time, day or night for the sheer pleasure of flexing his geeky muscles. For a hefty price the geeks will come to your house and resolve your computer issues but is it worth it? If you are desperate and have the money then the  Geek Squad is a good option. If you don’t have the money, their “thorough” investigations might get on your nerves especially if they are charging by the hour. Unfortunately any time you have someone work on something you own but have no clue to how it works, like a computer or vehicle it makes the matter even more complicated. The bottom line is, if you are desperate go with the squad, if you have time and little money, find your own geek.
