 Jack's Tech Tips: Party naked with the Geek Squad

                                   Jack's Tech Tips   Computer tips, tricks and news                                                                    Tuesday, May 10, 2011   Party naked with the Geek Squad         Ok let's talk about naked pictures and sexting. While it may be dangerous, people do all kinds of crazy things in the heat of the moment. I suspect that's part of the the thrill. Enough said.  What I don't get is bringing your computer loaded with naked photos to the Geek Squad for repair and then suing them for 50 grand for looking at them. It reminds me of a burgler suing for tripping on the stairs while trying to escape. For those of you who don't know the Geek Squad is Best Buy's computer repair division. They're the ones dressed in black slacks, white shirts and skinney black ties. An agent was fired after he confessed to copying a woman's photos onto his personal flash drive. The nude photos were then circulated around the Geek Squad area, according to court documents. While I agree Best Buy has an obligation to protect it's user's data, don't bring your computer in for repair if it has EVER contained any confidential data. Destroy it and buy a new one. Trust no one. And what's with the term Geek? Just because a guy works on computers we need to mislabel them as a misfit? I don't call the cable guy names. Stop calling us nerds and geeks!  Maybe that's part of the problem. No one wants to date a geek! Best Buy in the meantime is increasing security and monitoring in their workspaces. I've got a better idea. Why not get them hookers? Problem solved.   For more Geek Squad antics check out the video.         Posted by  Jack   at   11:38 AM                  Email This    BlogThis!
