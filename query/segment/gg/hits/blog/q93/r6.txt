They ended up junking out my product, which means they wiped it clean and sent it back to the manufacturer. I was never given the opportunity to say yes or no to the final solution to a very simple repair problem. I already filed different reviews but I have attached one I did on Yelp. It's the worst geek squad ever! Your product is not in good hands. They junked out my memories. I purchased a Mac Book in May of last year and purchased the Geek Quad protection plan for $199, which was the biggest waste of money. I took it in to get repaired in the beginning of October for a charging and a display resolution problem. After the initial diagnostic was performed, I was informed that the charger was not working properly and that the display monitor was somehow not connected correctly. After a few weeks of no news from them, I finally received a call saying that I needed to give them the okay to send my computer to their service center and that I needed to approve this. I approved them sending it out. But they declined to inform or ask me if I wanted their data package. To my understanding, it was not needed because there was no problem with any memory or RAM or motherboard. Therefore, my files didn't need any back up.  After over a month, I finally got a hold of someone. They were happy to inform me I would be getting a brand new Mac. They never offered, called me, emailed me, or gave me the choice to either get a new Mac or remain with my old one. Instead, they wiped out my computer clean and deleted years of pictures, work contacts, work papers, files, and everything I had worked for or ever taken that was in my old computer. It took two days for me to finally talk to someone that was smart enough at Geek Squad to call the warehouse and give me specifics on whether or not they could stop the junk out process. I will seriously never ever buy anything else at any Best Buy. I took in working computer and got excuse after excuse. I got different answers on what my computer really had. And I went from a simple repair to a junk out, which means everything got wiped clean and the product was sent back to the manufacturer. According to store policy, by me calling and giving the okay for them to send my product to their "service center", which should really be called the butcher, I supposedly declined any data backup.  I am truly disappointed in how little care and respect the so called Geek Squad or service center or Best Buy policies put into worrying about the product. A simple phone call informing me that my computer was going to be recycled would have been enough for me to say stop. Do not take your electronics of any sort to get any sort of maintenance or work done here. It seems that they have gotten too big for their own good and the product goes from hand to hand. And when they are tired of storing your product, the easiest thing to do is to junk it out.  Isha of Rowland Heights, CA     11/2/11  I am very disappointed. I drove 1 hour to have my computer fixed on 9/30/11, and received a notice to pick up once fixed. I brought it home two days later, drove 1 hour, and the computer is still not working. Drove one way again to take the computer back. Out of gas, out of work, the geek squad said it was fixed.  I brought it to their attention that the Best Buy's Geek Squad. I asked them to give me a gift card to help with my expense, but they just laughed. I even asked them about my reward points, as I bought my computers and TVs from Best Buy. Now I see why Best Buy's ratings are not as high as they used to be. I'm asking you to make this customer happy once again. Thank you. Kenneth of idabel, OK     10/31/11  I took my laptop in for repairs almost 30 days ago. They had to send it out to be repaired to the Louisville service center. They waited a week to order the replacement battery a week after they received it, when they knew they had to order it before it arrived. Now they are still waiting on the battery and have not returned my laptop, nor have I any idea when I will be getting it back.  The date I was given for it to be back was yesterday and when I called the local store they said there was nothing they could do but give me an update. I then called the corporate customer service and they said all they can do is put in a formal complaint. This is **. No one can give me an ETA , and all I get is the run around. Why do they bug people to purchase the warranties on products if they are just going to give the customer terrible service for using it? I put in the complaints, and now have the numbers to the district and general managers. I will be calling and heads will roll. Francine of Lansing, MI     10/25/11  On June 28, 2011, a Geek Squad technician came to my home and performed a diagnostic and repair at a cost of $394.37. Seven weeks later in August, that desktop PC was slow to respond then did not work. On August 13, 2011, another Geek Squad technician said the hard drive had crashed. So on that date, I purchased a new HP Pavilion P7-1042 desktop CPU, monitor, mouse, keypad and printer from Best Buy Coventry Road at a cost of $829.30. I actually got to pick it up on August 16, 2011. Next I had to purchase MS Word OHS 2010 software to replace MS Word 2000 at a cost of $146.89. After the new HP was set up by a Geek Squad technician, desktop icons frequently would not appear when the PC was turned on. Often I had to open in safe mode. There was no problem said your technician, just hit F8 or, F10 or, F11 or, control-shift-ESC to bring up Task Manager. No way did this work. The PC became slower then stopped working. I returned the tower to Best Buy Coventry Road on September 25, 2011. Well, guess what? The hard drive in this piece of crud had crashed after just six weeks. But then Best Buy had to send the tower to HP in Toronto for repair. It would take two to three weeks. My data would be wiped from the hard drive. So, I had to buy a flash drive at a cost of $20.33 and have my data downloaded at your Coventry Road location at a cost of $100.89. Would it have killed you to take a new HP CPU out of stock and transfer my data immediately without charge? Apparently it would, because on September 25, 2011, I had to buy an Acer AX3990-EB20P at a cost of $489.84 so I could continue to work on my home-based business. And what did the Geek Squad representative at Coventry Road suggest? He asked if I could borrow a friend's computer or use a library one in the interim. As of this date, October 18, 2011, I am still without your HP Pavilion P7-1042 product. No communication from HP's brilliant service staff either. L. of Ottawa, ON     10/18/11  I purchased an XBox 360 Wireless Turtlebeach Headset (retail of $29.99 with 2 year warranty of $8.00). Oh my God, I feel sorry for everyone on this post. My purchase was far smaller than any of the purchases posted here, and yet Best Buy still would not honor the 2 year Geek Squad warranty that they sold me. I purchased the warranty on my son's Wireless Xbox 360 headphones because I know he uses them every day. Well, one of the ear pieces snapped off of the headset, so I take it to Best Buy. They basically told me that he only had the headset for 6 months and the computer would not let them return the item as normal wear and tear because it had only been six months and it was out of policy. How is it out of policy when I have a two year warranty and it's only been 6 months? Are you serious?  Nobody tells you that when you purchase the warranty, you have to verify with a computer whether the product has been used long enough to determine if it is normal wear and tear or an accident. The headset only costs about $30.00, not like it would have hurt Best Buy's bottom line. No more Best Buy.

I got it back on May 25 and spent $150 to back up my data with another hard drive. The reason for bringing it in was because the screen was not working. On August 22, I brought it in because the screen was not working. I got it back on September 2 and they replaced the mother board. On Sept 24, I brought it in because the computer wouldn't go past the start up screen. They installed the anti virus and the Geek Squad Protection for one year for 199 dollars. I got it back on Sept 29. On October 1 and 3, I brought it in for the same problem (screen not going past start up screen). On October 3, in the morning, the Geek Squad tried to fix it remotely over the phone by controlling my computer via the web, although they couldn't fix it as the computer froze. I brought it in. I was told if the problem doesn't occur in their possession, then I will be "out of luck" and will get the computer back. The tech named Raul from Geek Squad in West Hartford told me that. Travis of Hartford, CT     10/4/11  Beware of LaToya! She is the supervisor for the dispatching of the Geek Squad in Oceanside, California. It took nine days for someone to install a router for my computer! No one showed for the first appointment and the second one was canceled. She hung up on me when I tried to schedule for a third appointment. She finally bumped me to 13 days on a whim just to show me who was the boss. Wow! I am a very frustrated and insulted customer! Bailey of Oceanside, CA     9/30/11  Since the beginning of 2011, I've been seeing a blue screen when I turn on my HP computer & it says something about a "crash dump". I've brought it into Best Buy for the Geek Squad to look at it. First, they did a system restore but it didn't work. Then it was a virus and didn't work. They made me buy a hard drive and still it didn't work. They told me again it was a virus. Then they said it was my monitor, keyboard & mouse but no it did the same thing on their monitor, keyboard & mouse.  My husband took it back 3 times in one day. They said they fixed it, but it may take up to 2 days to "kick in". I may not be computer savvy but I didn't just fall off the turnip truck either. I am not made of money to pay these idiots. We called corporate and they were just as stupid. I am so done with Best Buy & their Geek Squad. Did you know that those people aren't even trained to do this? It's all hands on. We've purchased more than $10,000.00 worth of computers, phones, 2 laptops, monitors, music & games from them . That is done. Penny of bay shore, NY     9/12/11  Best Buy sold me a universal screen protector made by Zagg and informed me that Geek Squad would charge me $7.99 to install it. I did not have the time to get this done at the time of purchase so I returned later in the evening, only to be informed that they would charge me double since they would have to do the cutting, even though they had seen my phone at the time of purchase. I knew that I had bought a universal protector that had to be shaped, and quoted a price. I protested to no avail, and no manager would even talk to me. Later, I called Best Buy corporate and narrated the episode. Someone apparently noted the details but never gave me a complaint number and Best Buy did not bother to contact me back. My feeling is that Best Buy is approaching that point in size were it is becoming indifferent to customers. Big mistake; service quality is important in the retail business and there are alternatives.  Watch out - other behemoths have collapsed in the past, all it takes is enough arrogance. Sid of Mequon, WI     8/22/11  Several days ago, I took my HP laptop to Best Buy's Dadeland Store to the geek squad to have a virus removed. After waiting over two days, it was ready. Not only did they remove the virus, they removed my Microsoft word and McAfee security as well.  When I went back and had to stand in line for over an hour to get service, the glib representative acted as if it was my fault and denied any responsibility whatsoever. While I can deal with screwups and incompetents (an accurate description of the geek squad), I will not accept their failure to take responsibility and correct the problem. It will be decades, if ever, before I purchase anything from Best Buy again.  I went to Office Depot and spent over $200.00 to replace the word and the security system. Fred of MIAMI, FL     8/17/11  I brought my TV in to be serviced. I was told it would take a week and a half to be fixed. It has now been a month and a half. It was a TV that was a new model. Within a year, I had problems with it. I brought it in because it had no picture and no sound. The Geek Squad sent it back with only the picture working. At one point, I think they lost my TV because no one saw a tracking number on it. The Geek Squad has made this bad situation into a nightmare. Michael of New York, NY     8/15/11  I bought a Sony Vaio VPCCW17FX/W laptop from the Best Buy (at 8300 Eager Road, Saint Louis, MO 63144-1421) on November 19, 2009 for $799.99 ($70.60 taxes), along with a three year Black Tie Protection on November 27, 2009 for $229.99, which is valid until November 27, 2012. I had just arrived from India to attend Saint Louis University a month earlier. I was told at university that I would need a laptop for college. As I was new here in the United States, I was not very well aware of the best places to buy a good laptop. I was told by friends and colleagues that Best Buy was a place known for its customer service and that it would be best for me to buy it at Best Buy.  I had no problems with the laptop during the first year of 2010. During the early part of 2011, I noticed some unusual issues. When I would be watching movies and browsing through pictures, the screen would freeze with the sound frozen as well. This would stay frozen for a few minutes; after which it would unfreeze with a pop up message in the right bottom corner system tray saying "Nvidia display driver stopped responding and has restarted", and with a few more lines of information.  I also noticed the sound quality deteriorated over time. There were times when the DVD drive would not read DVDs. I approached the Geek Squad with my issues the first time on May 25, 2011. The service notice they issued me said that the estimated return date was May 29, 2011. I did not hear back until June 05, 2011. All I was told was that Geek Squad was not able to find the issue, and so they just tweaked with the settings and the display drivers update. When I took the laptop back home, I was disappointed. I experienced the same issues on June 06, 2011. I received a call from Bryan at the Brentwood Best Buy in response to a service survey, which I had filled in response to the disappointing service I was given during the May 25 service.  Bryan informed me that I should bring the laptop back in, and that they would be putting the laptop through more extensive testing the second time. So on June 12, 2011, I took the laptop back to the Brentwood Best Buy. They took down my complaints, and issued me another service notice with a due date June 15, 2011.  I did not receive a call from Geek Squad until around June 21, 2011. Again, this time Geek Squad told me that they could not find the issue. I felt cheated. I felt as if Best Buy thought I was making up the issue. I returned home with my laptop ever more disappointed knowing that the issue still persisted. I decided to keep the laptop with me for the next two weeks, and document every time the issue occurred. I recorded videos, and took pictures with the error messages when they popped up. I returned to Best Buy on July 18, 2011 for the third time with documented evidence of the issues. This time the Geek Squad agent tells me that they would send the laptop to the company, and that I would hear back from them by around August 16, 2011.  On July 25, 2011, I checked the status of the order on the Geek Squad website; I was surprised that the message read that the laptop was to be exchanged, but I had not heard about it from anyone at Best Buy. I called Best Buy at about 1 PM on July 25, 2011 and at 2.30 PM on the same date to inquire about it. My call was not answered by the Geek Squad agent, but a Best Buy agent took my contact details and informed me that she would have them call me.  Until 7 PM on July 25, 2011 I did not receive any call; so, I called again only to be told that I should come by the store for an exchange. I reached the store at 8 PM on July 25, 2011. The Geek Squad agent told me that the laptop they sent to the company had trouble with the mother board and various other components. The estimated cost of repair was $1,134, which was way more than the original price of the laptop. So, they offered me to choose a new laptop. I went to the floor to look at the laptops, and was shocked to see the collection of laptops that I was given to choose from. There were a total of 4 Sony models; three of which were way low in configuration; Dell, Samsung, Toshiba and Asus were the only other laptops. I asked to see some HP and they told me that there were none similar to my configuration (all this after about an hour of asking for an agent to help me out choose a laptop and by then it was 9 PM). So, I requested that I be given some more time to choose a decent laptop worth my money and time.  The Geek Squad agent tells me that I had to buy it on that day, even when I was not offered the right help and service to choose from a decent collection of laptops. The only Sony laptop that was any close looked disgusting with a weird diamond design.  After much discussion, they permitted me to leave and come again another day with a promise that they would take care of the issue. I would like to bring to your notice some key issues which may be easily overlooked. Kindly take these into consideration when you assess my case. 1. I am an international student and very new to things in the United States. 2. I do not drive, and have to depend on the public transport to get from one place to another. 3. It takes me two hours to go back and forth from home to the closest Best Buy in Brentwood using the public transport. 4. After all this, I had to make three visits for the same issue after which nothing was done until I decided to shoot some videos of the issues and document them. At this point in time I totally doubt the service quality that Best Buy advertises. I am not sure if it is just a marketing tactic, or if Best Buy truly believes in keeping their customers happy. I would still want to believe that the latter is true. I have never been left so disappointed, and I must confess I feel cheated since this was my very first experience with Best Buy. MANAN of Saint Louis, MO     7/26/11  I had trouble with my computer. I took the tower to Best Buy as my computer didn't let me type double digit letters. They tested it and they said, they fixed it and they were not charging me. I took it home, put it all back together, and it had the same problem. I took it back to Best Buy again, this time the tower with the desktop screen. They said, it was a virus. They charged me $241.00. I took it home, then I couldn't even log on. So, I took it back again.Now, I'm pissed because the screen still isn't right. I'm wasting gasoline as I don't live near the store. They kept it for 4 days but when they returned it, it is still not right.  judith of depew, NY     7/11/11  I purchased a Sony VAIO Computer from Best Buy for $699.00 on 5/30/10. We were offered a 2-year extended warranty for $299.00. We did not ask, but thought the warranty was through Sony. On May 26, we realized our warranty was through Geek Squad because the laptop was not working, with a message "Recovery SetUp Not Working". We received an appointment for 6-3 (earliest available). Geek Squad showed up and told us that he could not do anything. We would have to call Sony; but for an additional charge of $99.99, he could transfer all the data off the laptop onto another hard drive. We paid the $99.99, but were upset that upon calling Sony, we were out of warranty. The problem with Best Buy is that at no time did the salesperson offer us an extended warranty from Sony, but instead sold us Geek Squad protection which offered us nothing but more additional costs. sandy of pomona, CA     6/27/11  The "short" story is that I purchased a card entitling me to 1 year of Geek Squad Tech Support.  What I was told and what appears on the "package" is that you get 24/7 support - In store - Online - Phone - Chat I purchased on June 24, 2011 and on June 24 I did use the technical support. I was very dismayed to discover that the support was by CHAT and I did not have the option of phone communication. It was a very disappointing and unpleasant experience.  When I called Best Buy, I was told that I had 30 days to return the card. When I went to the store; however, I was told that I could not return it since I had used it.  Spencer of Savannah, GA     6/26/11  On 2.22.11, I brought in my TV with a broken turn on button for repair with order #********. The TV turns on if you wait for 10 minutes, then there's a picture and sound. I took it home after the repair and I find out that it has no picture. I brought it back and picked the TV up 2 more times and still, there is no picture. They said that without an original receipt, they cannot grant me a replacement TV or refund my money. It was purchased February 2005 and the credit card does not supply receipts back that far.  I have spent $25.00 each time in cab fares, for a total of $100.00, back and forth. I have also spent $120.00 to fix it. They broke my TV and I put out $220.00 total in cab fares and surcharges.Since they don't allow testing of items after they are fixed, so thrice, i paid for the cabs back and forth and for repair of a broken TV. I am looking for a replacement TV and no one wants to help me.  denise of bronx, NY     4/22/11  I purchased a four-year extended warranty for a Sony Camcorder in 2007. I am now having problems with it but was told I would have to bring product to Best Buy so they could ship it for repair. I live 120 miles from closest store. One manager said he would allow me to ship it to him but he has yet to fax me the paperwork he said I would need. I called the store five times, sent several e-mails and even a fax, but I get no response. The warranty will be up in four weeks. Why do they sell extended warranties without explaining the strict limitations? I live on an isolated area (lower Florida Keys). We have one two-lane road to the mainland and during season it can take 3 hours to drive 120 miles. It would take a full day to take the camcorder in and given that I work full time and the difficulty in traveling I rarely leave the islands. Jolene of Summerland, FL     3/1/11  November 2009, I purchased two computers from BestBuy and was told I was getting free Webroot subscripition software for one year for both computers. One year went by and I realized that my credit card was charged two exact amounts. I looked at my receipt and read in very fine print that I had to call and cancel if I wished not to renew. I called at the beginning of December and spoke with an Agent ******* and he took care of processing the cancellation and told me I will receive a full refund. I called back about 3 weeks later to follow up and spoke with someone named Edward. Edward said that I should allow one billing cycle because of the busy holiday season but he assured me that I will receive my refund.  I called back on 2/1/11 and spoke with someone named Debbie. Debbie looked into the situation and said that it was escalated to corporate and that means I will be receiving my refund any day now, she repeated saying any day. I called back on 2/18/11 and spoke with someone named Theresa. Theresa said that the money was refunded on 1/19/11 and was trying to tell me that I needed to hang up and call my bank that I have my credit card with and ask them about it. At that point, things began to feel a little uneasy because on 2/1/11 I spoke to someone that knew the money was not refunded yet. I explained that to Theresa and she could see through her notes that I did call. She put me on hold a couple of different times and I finally told her that I will need to speak with a supervisor because I couldn't listen to her contradict what was told to me on 2/1. I knew there was a problem.  After being placed on hold for a very long time, I finally spoke to someone named Roland that referred to himself as one of the managers in software & subscriptions. I asked him if he was informed of my situation and he said that he was. He told me that unfortunately I would have to call my bank and ask them where the money is and that he is able to provide me with a "reference #". I explained to him that on 2/1/11, Debbie knew that the money wasn't refunded on 1/19/11 and that if I am going to contact anyone right now, it will be Consumer Affairs, the Better Business Bureau or both. Roland put me on hold for a while and when he came back, he corrected himself saying that the reference number he gave me was actually a case number when it was escalated to corporate.  At this point Roland wanted to offer me gift card. I snapped saying, "I want you to fix the problem!" He said that he didn't know what he could do. All he could do was escalate it again back up to corporate and give me the new case number. He said that he couldn't follow up on it for me and call me back. He said I would have to do that. I asked him who his supervisor is and he said that he answers to customer relations at corporate.  In 2/22/11, I called customer relations and spoke with someone named Alex. Alex told me that he doesn't handle any problems and that I should really be contacting software & subscription, the same place that I called the past 4 times. I told him that I already did and I spoke to a supervisor there named Roland and that supervisor says he can't help me at all, nothing he can do for me and referred me to consumer relations. At this point Alex gave me another case number referring to our phone call. Alex said he has to check with people regarding this and he says he doesn't even know the people who can be contacted that will be able to help with the situation. He told me that he will try to get back to me before the end of this week. Jay of Leominster, MA     2/22/11  On November 18th, 2007, I purchased a Gateway computer from Best Buy so I could attend online classes through the local community college. It was regularly $399.99 on sale for $199.99. It was slightly scratched up and looked as though it had been owned previously and returned. I told the salesman I didn't like the idea of purchasing a computer that had been owned by someone else. I was concerned that it might contain a virus or may have at one time. Even if it hadn't, I would wonder what problems it had and why had it been returned.  The salesman assured me that no one had owned it and it was considered an "out of box" sale. He also stated that the Geek Squad would go through the entire system to make sure it was in proper working order. In addition, they would install an anti-virus program. In order for the Geek Squad to complete this, it was necessary that I leave the computer with them and I was told I could pick it up in a couple of days. They installed Webroot Spy Sweeper and Trend Micro Anti-Virus, which they charged me $58.00 to install. I was also convinced to purchase a 2 year Performance Service Plan for $49.99.  Less than a year later, I began experiencing problems with the computer. It started running slowly, locking up and shutting down unexpectedly. It continued to get worse so I took it in to the Geek Squad for repair. The first thing I did was remind them of my Performance Service Plan. I was informed that it didn't cover wiping a virus, only hardware related issues. The charge for wiping the virus was $129.99 and an additional $99.00 if I wanted my pictures and music recovered. Not being in a position to afford the additional cost of $99.00 (I really couldn't even afford the $129.99), I authorized them to wipe the system entirely, including any media files. They had my computer from 10/18/2008 through 10/24/2008. Around the time I picked up my computer from the Geek Squad, I was moving into a new place and I was not able to afford the internet. Since there were not too many things I needed to use my computer for without internet access, I used it very little during 2009 and most of 2010, and when needed, I had access to a computer and internet at work. Around October or November of 2010, I started using my computer more, mostly to listen to music. I began noticing that it was running extremely hard and making a lot of noise. I figured it was probably dusty inside so I took the cover off and blew out all of the dust. Even after a thorough cleaning it continued to labor while running with the fan kicking on quite often.  I started looking through the system and found through the "Event Viewer" under Administrative Tools that a considerable amount of tasks had been running on my system for 2 years! Then, I noticed that files were appearing that were unfamiliar and some of my Microsoft Office 2007 applications were appearing in odd places. I disabled a few start-up items and a short time later, they would be enabled on their own. It became apparent that my system had a virus. The more I dug, the more I found.  I was completely shocked to find out that in addition to another virus (or the same virus), my computer was and had been accessed remotely using my I.P. address. So even though I did not have an internet connection, my computer was basically turned into a Botnet. Come to find out, the Microsoft Office 2007 program that I had purchased online was counterfeit (which I have verified with Microsoft) and more than likely, a result of phishing due to information gained from my virus infected computer. I also renewed my Webroot Spy Sweeper and Micro Trend Anti-Virus over the internet, which were also fake. I paid about $150 for all 3 programs and none of them were valid.  Based on all of the documentation I have found on my computer, the virus was on my system when I plugged it in and set it up on 10/25/2008, the day after I picked it up from the Geek Squad after they supposedly wiped it of the virus. I have documents and copies of tasks that were running on the system on 10/21/2008, while my computer was in possession of the Geek Squad. I have found events, tasks, documents, and files dating back to June 2006, a year and a half prior to the date I purchased the computer.  In fact, I found that in June of 2006 alone, over 20,000 events had been run on the system. Whoever has taken control of my computer has had access to and has been uploading all of my personal information - my social security number, driver's license number, medical and dental information, credit card numbers, my checking account number, pay stubs, tax information, email accounts, log ins and all of my passwords. They also gained access to all of my family's and friend's personal information such as phone numbers and addresses, my financial aid information, resumes, all of my pictures, my son's personal information, his grades, his social security number, the schools he has attended; you name it, they have it! It makes me ill to know that my life is out there floating around for God knows who to see, and is any of it being used? Also, as a result of this, I have had 3 Blackberry phones since July of 2010, which I now realize were infected by my computer. My son's laptop has also been infected.  I called Best Buy and spoke with a Geek Squad manager and explained the situation. She said that it was not their fault or problem that my computer was infected and had been for 2 years. She offered the services of the Geek Squad, stating that they would be more than happy to wipe my system again to rid my computer of the virus and it would cost me $129.99. She also told me that they don't keep computers for more than 3 months and that new models are continuously replacing them. If that is the case, then why does mine have files and tasks that are more than a year and a half old? And if it was never owned by someone else, why were all of the tasks scheduled? How is that possible? In total, there have been almost 180,000 events run on the system. And how can the Geek Squad say that they aren't responsible for a virus that was never wiped from my system that they charged me $129.99 to wipe? If that is the case, should they not inform their customers that they will be paying $129.99 to be without their computer for 7 days, only to still have a virus? Why would they charge an additional $99.99 to recover my music and pictures yet leave files (and possibly a virus) that I paid $129.99 for them to wipe? I would bet that there are possibly many Geek Squad customers that have paid for this same service that will find their computer was never properly wiped and is still infected with a virus or even worse, their system has been turned into a Botnet. Alison of Lancaster, CA     1/16/11  RE: Dispute for charges from Best Buy Here is my declaration of exactly what happened: My Mother lives near Oxnard, California and on my way home to Sherman Oaks, I decided to stop in at the Oxnard Best Buy store to inquire as to what the Geek Squad in-home repair service could do for me. I was accompanied by my partner who was witness to everything herein stated. I had two laptops and one PC that needed to be fixed.  I thought that if I purchased enough time with a tech, I could get all three fixed. I approached the Geek Squad counter and asked the salesman what would be the best bargain for my dollar to have three computers fixed at my home? He said they were having a special for installing home networks. I told him I already had a home network and did not need that type of service.  He then explained that the technician did not have to do the network, that he could do anything to my computers as I was paying for his time. He then added that I should purchase the additional Diagnostic service so that the tech could spend that time finding out what was wrong and then the network setup time fixing it. I agreed that I would pay additionally for any hard drives or parts that would be required.  The network setup also came with a free 6 month tech support which can be accessed either by phone or on the Web. We set up an appointment for September 20. On that date, a tech arrived from the Geek Squad the receipt he left had no name but he said it was Eric. The last four digits of his employee number on the receipt 9810.  Prior to his arrival I received a phone call from the Geek Squad telling me that I still owed $65.00 and should pay Eric when he arrived. I told the woman on the phone that I had paid in full and have a receipt to prove it. I thought it strange that I would receive such a call as my Best Buy receipt showed that I had paid in full. I got the feeling they were trying to get more money out of me. When Eric arrived I showed him the two laptops and the PC and he had no issue in looking at each. He first looked at the PC. He inserted his flash drive into my computer. It supposedly contained his diagnostic program. I told him that I was having problems with my AOL freezing and that I wanted the computer cleaned up.  He ran some other things and told me I should be using IE 7 instead of IE 8, but that the rest of my system was working great. He also updated a driver for my scanner. I had antivirus software and I am very careful about opening sites I am not familiar with.  On this PC, I had the numbers of two of my credit card accounts, my Wells Fargo and a Chase Freedom account. They were in a program called Robo Form, which is pretty secure.  Eric then looked at the two laptops and told me one needed a new hard drive, but was not worth fixing. The other he said was fine. Except for doing a change in my Internet Explorer and updating one driver, and cleaning files on two, he did nothing more to any of the computers he looked at.  He left and we did not use the computers for the rest of that day. The next morning I started my PC and had two emails, one from Wells Fargo and the other from Chase. Someone had stolen the numbers on both cards and had made unauthorized purchases.  I also found that my screen freeze issue had not been fixed nor my scanner and I had more viruses on my computer than I had ever had WITH my antivirus software.  All three computers were still running slow and it appeared as though nothing had been done. I phoned Best Buy to complain and they sent me to their Public Defender who said they would phone back once they had looked into this. They have yet to call back.  I then remembered I had an old hard drive that I could install in the laptop that needed replacing but I was unsure as how to do that. I went to the Geek Squad site for my free tech help and was told they could not tell me and that it would cost me another $49 to $69 to get that assistance. I refused. I finally found, on my own, how to install the hard drive but the software was not working.  I phoned the Geek Squad support again and again was told I would have to pay extra for them to help me. What happened to the free Geek Squad Technical Support? I then took my laptop to a reputable store and it was made totally ready to go for an additional $105.00.  I decided to go to my nearest Van Nuys Best Buy and demand a refund for service I did not receive. I was even willing to trade them setting up my laptop, which would have cost them less, than get my money back. The manager of the Van Nuys store said I would have to go back to the Oxnard store with my complaint. I returned home and phoned the manager of the Oxnard store.  I explained everything as I have here and he argued that I got MORE than what I had paid for. That I should only have gotten one diagnostic on one computer and that I did not pay for repairs. I explained that his employee had told me to purchase the Geek Squad service in the manner I had because that would include the diagnostics on 3 computers and repairs. The manager told me that I had paid just for the network setup and one diagnostic. And that the 6 month support was ONLY for the network setup.  I argued with him that I had told his employee that I did not need a network setup but was told that this would allow me to obtain what I required for the least amount of money. He was very rude and kept trying to defend his employee. I asked for my money back and he refused. I then told him about the theft of my credit card and he said that was not his problem.  So now I still have the same issues on my PC that I had before the Geek Squad cameplus the inconvenience of having to have canceled two credit cards and file claims against two unauthorized purchases. If I had gone to the reputable store instead of Best Buy, it would have cost me less and I would not have the mess I ended up with. I feel that I paid for and did not receive: Repair of my PC.  6 months free technical support.  An honest employee.  Any consideration by either Best Buy manager when I complained. I have since been online to find that there are literally thousands of similar complaints against the Geek Squad and Best Buy, especially the 6 month tech support and the lack of knowledge by the Geek Squad techs in repairing computers.  I wish to get my money back. I feel I was not given what I paid for and that there were deceitful practices by both the salesman and the technician, Eric. My credit card company looked into my complaint and said they could not find any reason that I should not have to pay for this lack of service. Thank you, Lisa ******* Lisa of Sherman Oaks, CA     12/8/10  Took my Sony VAIO (purchased @ Best Buy for $2700) to Best Buy Geeksquad after getting software virus (windows would boot up in a loop but no hardware issues) Geeksquad returned my laptop in a completely inoperable state; laptop will not even power on and now geek squad says the mother board is bad (there was nothing wrong with the mother board when I brought in to them for repair) Store Manager refuses to compensate me with a similar computer saying my laptop was older, and their computers are better therefore not an even swap for them...even though the geek squad damaged my computer beyond repair, which is the ONLY reason I'm even having to purchase another laptop.  Terrible customer service and after 6 trips to the store I could not get any resolve from anyone in management. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible way to treat a customer who has spent thousands of dollars in the store - the retail price of a brand new Sony VAIO is roughly 1000 (retail price, NOT the price Best Buy is eating if they were to do the right thing and replace my laptop that THEY are responsible for damaging) - they lost my business, my family's business, my 3000 coworkers, and any business I do with my corporate card over their refusal to do the right thing... Susan of Dallas, TX     11/25/10  On October 13, 2010, my boyfriend and I went to best buy in Old Country road, Long Island. I had to get my gaming laptop (ASUS G72GX-RBBX05) screen fixed.It was flickering on and off. Sometimes it would even blacken out for a few seconds. So we left it for geek squad trusting that they can do their job by fixing it. Three weeks later, going into November which is the amount of time we were supposed to wait for my lap top to be shipped back from Kentucky, I had received a call from Best Buy notifying that my lap top was ready.  We went to pick it up the day after I received the call and we took it back to my boyfriend's house. We checked out the laptop by changing the screen resolution and that's when we found out that the nvidia graphic card that originally was in the laptop could not be detected on the device. They also broke the disk drive which is called the optical bezel drive. We had to bring it back and this time we spoke to another technician and they had to send it out again. One to two weeks later, they called again, we went to pick it up. This time we checked it in front of them to make sure everything was in good shape. The disk drive was fixed. We took it back home and tested a DVD in the disk drive, it showed that the E drive was not recognizable. We then tried to connect to a network and found out that the smart card was not recognized as well on the device. It was on some broadband connection that we could not detect. We took it back in the next day and told them to test it out themselves. One of the technicians put in a cd and for some reason it worked. I don't know what they did exactly.. We asked the technician that we couldn't get any signal back home because the smart card was not recognized. Best Buy's technician told us that it was connected to a broadband in Kentucky and they disconnected the wireless network connections. So basically they messed up the connection settings. We were fed up with best buy on everything they did. All we wanted was just for them to fix the flickering screen and we found problems on my laptop leading from one to the other. My boyfriend called the cops trying to help me out by letting the cops know that they broke my laptop and that geek squad is just scamming us. He didn't want me to get taken advantage of by Best Buy. So he told the cops the problem with my laptop. They thought this was absurd and they asked me that I had two options. The woman cop asked me if I wanted geek squad to either continue fixing my laptop or for me to just take my laptop and leave without dealing with geek squad anymore and just forget about everything.  The boss, William ****** was there the whole time. We followed him to the customer service after finishing up with the cops. The cops walked off without a polite note while my bf told them have a goodnight. William introduced us to one of their best technicians. This technician checked out my laptop while my bf made sure he would fix everything in front of us so we won't have to come back anymore for more problems. He took out a lot of the unnecessary things that I didn't need and got our connection running smoothly. The boss told the technician to make sure everything was 100% with my laptop. We took it back home hoping that things were finally patched up and better.  My bf checked my computer, tested a the grand theft auto4 game from my steam account and found out that it could not play due to an error. We tried Transformers as well which happened to work, but the graphics were a little choppy, not as crisp and sharp as it originally was when I first purchased it. He found out under one of the settings that it said generic pnp monitor which he thought was a generic screen that was replaced due to the flickering which was the main thing that we brought it to BB in the first place.  My laptop came with a LCD screen with LED back-light. We went back again the next day for them to check.We were more furious due to the fact that we had to go back again since we live far from BB. My bf has wasted half of his tank of gasoline due to my lap top never being fixed 100% by them. After going in for like the fourth or fifth time, we spoke to the supervisor, Anthony C.. We were outraged and started complaining. Best Buy called the cops for COMPLAINING as a customer. How is that wrong if you can't even fix my lap top? Here I thought geek squad are supposed to be trained professional technicians but, it doesn't seem like that at all. It's good to be intelligent but without enough knowledge, it doesn't help. All I wanted was the screen to be fixed which to be honest, it still flickers. Anthony mentioned that if it is not fixed after 4 times, he will give me the same lap top, but there were no more displays of the floor model from what I remember him saying. The problem is not over yet. It has just begun. It was until I picked up my lap top the next day. It was November 10th already. I ended up finding out that my lap top is damaged/ broken. I turn it on, it goes to Windows, I noticed Anthony had reformatted my laptop. I then try to go online, my boyfriend then helps me download firefox and steam to retrieve my game account. What happened after was that as the downloads were done, I tried opening firefox and steam and it took forever to load. I tried closing the programs and retrying it but, I ended up finding out that everything froze.  I turned off the laptop and then turned it on again to restart it. This time, I started windows normally as usual. As soon as I clicked on "start windows normally," my screen was black for like 20 minutes or more. So I turned it off, then on again, and this time it went to windows. I got online, but it froze again on me. It just keeps freezing. The laptop runs beyond slow.  This NEVER ever happened to me before. I can't even go online or play any of my games without it freezing or loading at all. He broke my laptop and this is uncalled for. I can't even get my refund back along with my warranty insurance. My boyfriend and I both called the headquarters to see if we can speak to the CEO and they wouldn't let us, so the highest representative we spoke to was an executive supervisor. They did not help at all whatsoever. We explained to them about the damages due to my laptop. All they said was that they cannot refund any of the amount back. BB headquarters even told me that I should keep going back their and letting geek squad fix it under my warranty. We told the executive supervisor that we already complained to Best Buy in Long Island and we let them repair it like 5 times and we did not get anywhere. The headquarters did not even solve any of our problems which is beyond horrible. This company is scamming people with money and treating customer service with very bad conduct. I really think this is a bad reputation for Best buy. As a customer, I deserve to have my product fixed and satisfied but it just leads to one problem after the other. We tried making a deal with the headquarters if we can just get a refund back and we won't bother with them anymore, but no, not on their policy. These damages are giving me emotional distress and anxiety. And to top it off, they seem to blame me or my boyfriend for breaking it which is not right. My boyfriend knows enough about computers that he even finds and sees these problems with what best buy is doing. As a customer, I am filing this complaint because I am very upset and that was one of the best gaming laptop there was that my boyfriend chose for me. There are even proofs of other people complaining about their problems with best buy if you google best buy complaints. I really want to do something about this and stop all this. Jennifer of College Point, NY     11/18/10  I purchased a three year warranty on a Windows Vista Laptop. My hard-drive died and I went to the Flagstaff Best Buy Store to redeem my warranty. I found the staff, and particularly the store manager to be rude,arrogant and basically not interested in customer service.  I was upset because they told me that the computer would take three weeks to fix. I was told different things by different employees. One employee told me that Best Buy was cutting back on employees and that there was only one guy to fix about 60 computers. When I called management, they said that the computer was " sent out," to a service center. So, given that I was given conflicting reports I knew something was not right.  When I finally got the computer back, I had the computer less than 10 days, when the computer locked into position solidly for several days. I then had to make another round trip to Flagstaff which is for me over an hour to get to Best Buy. When I got there, they plugged in the computer, and it seemed to work fine. I told them that I was still having problems, that the computer had locked into place for several days, and some other issues I was still having with the computer.  I was met with disbelief, and the store manager was very arrogant. " Our tech cannot duplicate your issues," he said. " How long do you want us to hold your computer?" My answer was, " until it is fixed!" So, we went a couple of rounds like that. He was so sure I was just complaining for the sake of complaining. Would I make a round trip of over an hour just for the sake of complaining? I think not. So, they held my computer for several days. I had to call them to find out if my computer was ready. I was told that they had tried to reach me. But that number never showed up on my cell phone  . All in all, I was totally dismayed with the level of courtesy, lack of respect for my purchased warranty, and a blase attitude about whether my computer was truly fixed or not. They couldn't care less and it showed! This morning, my computer is showing problems again.  I will NEVER purchase anything ever again from Best Buy. Thanks for listening. Leanne of Cottonwood, AZ     11/11/10  I bought an HD camcorner in Jan/2010. It was a $1400 camera and was told it had a 1 yr warranty by the sales rep at best buy. After no more than 6 uses it the LCD went black and it stopped recording 8 months later in Aug/2010.  I called best buy and they told me to bring it in. Took it in that day and was told that part were covered for 1 year and labor 6 months. I thought..."That sucks but I can live with it. If that's worst case scenario, i can live with it. I can see where the salesperson might have been confused." I was told that the camera would be back in two weeks no later the three weeks.  Two months later, I still have no camera and was told by geek squad and sony that they don't have any record of the camera. I have been lied to and told many different contradicting stories that make no sense. Geek squad/best buy accepted my camera, it was send to a sony repair center in Laredo, Tx.  When I called Laredo Tx, they told me it was sent to Precision Camera in CT (which it wasn't), at times, those calls are routed to a call center in El Salvador. The worst call center ever!!!! As of today, 10/16/2010, I have no camera, no one taking ownership, no answers, no solutions and every time I ask for a manager, I'm told one doesn't exist.  I'm at a total loss. dylan of Covina, CA     10/16/10  I went to geek squad because I have the geek squad protection. I have a missing hinge on the door of the blu ray player. It was always missing from day one yet I knew I had the geek squad protection so I waited. Over time the door got worse and there were times when I had manually shut it. It NEVER had the hinge. They said that geek squad protection does not cover accidental damage but I never harmed it and only touched to set it up.  They said they don't cover abuse. Now come on I am so stupid that I don't see a hinge on the floor or somewhere around the product; I did look. Mike told me that I did not know what I had purchased.  Sandy told me that they would do NOTHING for me. She called the police on me treating me like I was a criminal or a liar. I don't like to be treated like a scammer. I have called consumer relations at best buy and I am waiting for a call back.  I worked in retail myself and I was taught never to argue with a customer it is unprofessional.  MIchelle of Kansas City, MO     10/13/10  Sales staff not thorough. Geek Squad wants to "install" software for extra $. When you call for service - they want you to pack up your computer and bring it in.

Mary of MILWAUKEE, WI     9/17/10  I purchased a Klipsch HDT 500 speaker system from Best Buy for about $600 in April 2010. This system includes four satellite speakers for front and surround, a center channel speaker, and a self-powered sub-woofer. Two of the satellite speakers failed in the end of July 2010. I contacted Klipsch the following day, and was informed that Best Buy would handle the warranty for me. They explained that if I couldn't get this resolved through Best Buy, they would be more than happy to handle it directly for me. The downside to that would be that I would have to pay to ship the two defective speakers to Klipsch for repair or replacement. I then called Best Buy to determine if they could handle the warranty claim. The Geek Squad agent I spoke with said yes, and informed me that I only had to bring in the two defective speakers. He also informed me that if they couldn't fix them, they would happily exchange them in-store.   I took both speakers in on my next day off from work - Aug 11 2010. They created a service order, and told me they would contact me once the repairs were completed. Best Buy called me the next day, and apologetically told me I would actually have to bring in the entire speaker set. I told them the next opportunity for me to do so would be the following Sunday. They said that would be OK. I spent over an hour dismantling my speaker layout, and carefully re-packaging it in the original box with the original packaging materials. I took notes on any damage on the remaining speakers (only a slight scratch on the back of two satellites). I also verified that the serial number on the sub-woofer matched the serial number on the box, so we (hopefully) wouldn't have to remove everything at the store. I then spent another hour setting up my old speaker system, and tuning it.  Upon arrival at Best Buy the next day, the Geek Squad agent tried to open my original service order. He found that it had been closed for some reason. He went ahead and opened a new service order, but somehow skipped the serial number field on it. Instead of correcting it, he just added the serial number in the symptoms part of the order. I verified all the information was correct, and then signed the service order. I was told at that time that I would receive a call if they needed any further information, or when my speakers were ready to pick up.  I received three generic emails from August 16 to August 29. Each time I received an email, I checked my order status on the Best Buy website. This was not an issue until the last email. On August 29, my service order apparently no longer existed. I immediately contacted the local Best Buy, and was informed that my speakers were ready for pickup. They said they always close the orders when items arrive back at the store. I told them I would be there on September 01, my next day off from work, to pick up the speakers.  On September 01, I went to Best Buy to pick up the speakers. I was concerned as to why there was now a second repair order along with the original. The Geek Squad agent told me that the service center automatically generates a second order once repairs are completed. That sounded quite reasonable, so I signed the paperwork and brought my speakers back home. I spent yet another hour and a half dismantling my old speaker setup, and re-installing the new speaker set. The last item was the sub-woofer. Upon removing it from the box, I noticed the power cord was tightly wound, rather than loosely wound and secured with a twist tie as I had packaged it. It was quite obvious they had removed it from the box for some reason, probably to test the entire system. I hooked up the sub-woofer, and found that the power indicator didn't work when I plugged it in. I tried all three power switch settings, with no activity from the indicator. I then unplugged the unit, and heard a light "thump" as I did so. At this point, I figured the indicator probably just failed. I really didn't want to take everything apart and wait another month for repairs, so I decided I could live just with a tiny LED being out.   Unfortunately, tuning the system didn't go very well. I had to turn up the sub-woofer's built-in volume control to its maximum setting in order for it to be detected during tuning with my Denon A/V receiver. Even with that setting, the receiver had to increase its output quite a bit to compensate for the sub-woofer's low output. I pulled the sub-woofer away from the wall to re-check my connections again, and decided I should verify the serial number. I compared the numbers and realized this wasn't the same sub-woofer I took to Best Buy.   I then looked closer at the service order that the service center generated, and saw that they had included the serial number for this defective sub-woofer in the previously blank serial number field on the order. My original serial number is still listed under "symptoms".  I have made several calls to my local Best Buy since then. The first two calls were on September 02. The first person I talked to told me to just bring in the sub-woofer for an exchange, and then hurriedly got off the phone. I knew that was wrong, as this is part of a boxed set. I called back that evening after work, and spoke to another agent who seemed to understand, and wanted to help, but didn't really know how. He verified that they could not simply exchange only the sub-woofer. He then said he would email the service center, but it could be as late as September 07 before he received a response. With a hurricane due to pass by that evening, and Monday being a holiday, I understood. I called my local Best Buy on the evening of September 07 after not receiving the expected phone call. After selecting to be connected to the Geek Squad, the line rang over 20 times. I hung up the phone, and immediately contacted Best Buy via their toll-free number.  The Geek Squad agent I spoke with at the toll-free number was very understanding. He came to the same conclusion I did: my sub-woofer somehow got switched with someone else's at the service center. He placed me on hold while he called my local Best Buy directly. After a brief hold, he connected me with a supervisor at my local Best Buy. The supervisor told me he would call the service center and try to find out how the sub-woofers got switched. He said he would be at work around 11:30 AM, and would call as soon as he got there.I received a call from a different person at my local Best Buy the next afternoon. The woman who called told me I would need to bring in the sub-woofer so they could send it off for repairs. She obviously had no idea what was going on with my situation, as they couldn't accept part of the set. I told her I didn't want it repaired, I just wanted someone to find my original sub-woofer, and switch it with the defective oneI was given. She told me that wasn't possible because Best Buy sends all Klipsch speaker service orders directly to Klipsch. If I wanted to find my original sub-woofer, I would have to contact Klipsch directly.  I attempted to call Klipsch directly that evening, but it was after their normal business hours. I called them again on September 09, and was informed that Klipsch does not do any repairs for Best Buy. They only supply parts to Best Buy so they can perform repairs at their own service facility. It was quite evident that I had been lied to by Best Buy at this point. I told my employer what was going on, and he reluctantly agreed to allow me an extended lunch break so I could go directly to the store.   When I arrived at the store, I asked to speak with the manager. I was told they had several managers, and one was contacted for me. I explained the issue in detail, and she went to speak with another person about it. She then came back to inform me they were calling the service center to get more information. After they finished their call, they told me the only option was to bring the entire set in to be sent out for repairs again. They told me that they never opened the box at the store, and that the second service order was actually generated at the store (not at the repair center). I asked them how the wrong serial number got on the second repair order if they never opened the box, and they stated that someone must have opened it to scan it. There is no bar code on the sub-woofer, so scanning it is impossible. I told them I verified the numbers before I brought the system back. They just told me that serial numbers on components are sometimes different from what is on the box.   They just continually ignored that fact that I was given the wrong unit, and continued to tell me my only option was to have them send it off for repairs again. I finally ran out of time, and just left the store. I felt like I was being called a liar by the very people who lied to me. The sub-woofer is now in a state where it works most of the time (the LED even magically started working), but it drops out completely at random times. I'm quite confident that sending it out for service through Best Buy is not going to resolve my issue. They will most likely run a few tests, determine it is OK, and send it back. I don't want to spend a couple more hours dismantling the system, setting it up, and tuning it, only to have more issues.  I made one last attempt at correcting this by calling Best Buy's toll-free number. The representative I spoke with contacted the local store, and conferenced all three of us together. Once again, I told them that I just want my old sub-woofer back. If they can't find it, I'll be happy with exchanging the system with a known good system (new). The manager at the local store said she couldn't do that, and she didn'y appreciate me accusing them of doing something "shady". I told her I didn't think they were trying to "rip me off", but it was obvious that someone made a mistake. I made it clear that I just wanted that mistake rectified. I even asked if I could just get my money back, and stated that I was willing to pay any restocking charge they had to apply. I was told the ONLY option was to send the set off for repair again. Wayne of Hubert, NC     9/10/10  i purchased many appliance and a flat screen TV. when the geek squad came over they if i would want my TV mounted. he mounted the TV crooked. charged me 600.00. i thought the 600.00 was for the installment of my home theater. well i gave him a check and than canceled it. the installer said he would not accept cash. well now he visited my house. i wasn't home. told my neighbor if i didn't pay him he would take my equipment back  i called him. now he said he will except cash. i have equipment like wires and etc. that i payed for that i can not use. i feel like Ive been ripped off 250.00 just for his services. best buy did not tell me about any other equipment. now i have a home theater system sitting here no boxes because they took it out of it  jacqueline of buffalo, NY     9/7/10  I purchased a $150 Western Digital 2 Terrabite external hardrive in July 2010 and began transfering DVDs to the hardrive without problems. Then, 4 weeks later the hardrive (1/2 full) would not open. After trying everything to open it I returned the item to place of purchase (Best Buy Monrovia, CA) where they also could not open it. Unfortunately I failed to keep my receipt (although they certainly have a record of my charge on file) so they sent the item out to their Geek Squad partners to save the files. Three weeks later I get a call with the quotes: $460 to save the files and $80 for new (smaller) hardrive! Almost $600!!!! I told them absolutely not - keep the hardrive, and I will take my son-in-laws advice and shop Amazon.com for a new hardrive and re-transfer the files myself, AND I told them that they would lose my business in all of their stores from this point on. Michael of Monrovia, CA     9/1/10  My 42" Plasma TV, purchased from Best Buy in Fayetteville Georgia on February 12 2010 stopped working on August 13th. I called The Geek Squad who put me in contact with a technician in my area. That tech, who asked a few questions about the TV, told me someone would come to my home on Monday the 16th between the hours of 8 pm and Noon to fix my TV (prompting my daughter to make changes to her plans that morning).  On that Monday, after 1 pm, I called the Tech's number and spoke to a different tech (his name was Tim) who informed me that no one had acted on my "ticket" at all and he asked me all the same questions that was asked of me on Friday. He then advised me that he would have to order parts for the TV and it would be "2 or 3 days" to get the part and send a tech out to my home. He was somewhat apologetic, but didn't act as if this was anything out of the ordinary from the way they operate. He called me back about an hour later and told me he was required to have the TV serial number before Panasonic would send the parts. That had to wait until I got home from work. By the time I got home and got through on the phone to Tim, it was already after 4 pm. I now understand that Tim ordered the parts on the 17th. So today, Friday the 20th, still not having heard from Tim, I call him and ask when he is going to fix my TV. He tells me he only has one of the 3 parts he needs and "so it looks like sometime next week". So at this time I think a call directly to Panasonic is in order. I call and have a long conversation with a young man named "Ryan", who was no help at all. All he can tell me is that the parts are on back order and should be there within 3-5 days form the order date (which was the 17th). He cant tell me anything else and advises me there isn't anyone else he can put me in contact with who can do any better than that.  So I call back the Geek Squad and tell them I cant get me TV, which I purchased with and extended (black tie) warranty from them less than 6 months go, fixed nor a projected date for sure when it will be fixed. They refused to do anything because its still under Panasonic warranty. I even called the local store I purchased it from (Fayettville, Ga, phone number 678-817-0077) and they told me the Store Manager was not there and wont be until sometime tomorrow.  The bottom line is that my TV, less than 6 months old, is broke and no one can tell me when it will be working again.  Douglas of College Park , GA     8/20/10  Best Buy has lost my business for everything due to the geeky GEEK SQUAD. They lie, cheat and are strange. Do not buy a PC from them! Bart of Fletcher, NC     8/17/10  I brought my laptop into Best Buy to have the Geek Squad fix the LCD screen which had cracked. I hooked the computer up to an external monitor to see that it was booting into Windows, which was a good sign, but I just wanted to make sure that there was no further internal damage aside from just the screen. The guy who helped me, Steve, told me that it would be $80 to have the computer sent out and diagnosed, at which point I would receive a phone call regarding all the problems with my computer.  In other words, they'd perform all their tests before charging me and let me know everything that is wrong, and then they would tell me what it would cost to fix. If I declined the service, they'd refund $50 and it would have only cost me $30 for them to ship the computer out and return it as well as perform the diagnostic test. This is what I was told. It turned out that they were going to charge me to fix the screen (could cost $500 to do) and then run their tests (the tests which I was told would be done initially without having to pay to fix the screen). I called to inquire as to why they couldn't hook the laptop up to an external monitor to run their tests, and the Geek Squad manager could not explain why to me.  I finally went into the Tinley Park Best Buy and spoke with a manager, Jessica; I wanted all $80 back because I had been deceived regarding their service cost and because the Geek Squad had successfully done absolutely nothing with my computer. The manager refused to refund my money, only giving me the $50 back. She told me the $34 was just for shipping and there wasn't any diagnostic test involved with that fee. I would have been fined with paying the $34 if it had been made clear to me when I dropped the laptop off that it was strictly for shipping, and that I'd have to pay extra to get the screen fixed first before finding out if anything else was wrong with it.  Jessica became sarcastic with me as our conversation went on, and I made it clear to her that Best Buy would lose several very good customers because of her attitude and lack of understanding. She seemed to not care about me and to not take me seriously; consequently I feel quite undermined and offended. I will never shop there again. I am out of roughly $30 now because I was deceived by the Best Buy and Geek Squad staff. I feel as though I wasn't taken seriously and am quite offended by the lack of action by the Best Buy manager. Michael of Tinley Park, IL     7/22/10  I bought a printer and was having problems with it. I called Best Buy and after I expressed the product was under warranty (it was three days old), the Geek Squad informed me there would be a fee to fix it. I told them it was under warranty, but they once again told me there would be a fee to fix it, and did not disclose the telephone number of the free tech support. The staff was cocky, arrogant and seemed to be having fun dealing with my complaint. They refused to give an employee ID number, connect me with a general manager, give me a corporate office number to call or do anything, other than be way too delighted to connect me to another number with a twenty-minute answer time. The worst part was them laughing at my complaint. kim of kgp, MI     7/21/10  I took my laptop to BB where it was purchased as it would not boot up. I was advised that this was a motherboard issue and that it would be covered under my PSP, this was in June of '09. I picked it up and it worked fine until October '09, when I encountered the same problem. I took it back to the same store and was advised that it was the motherboard again and it would be sent off to service. After begging gone for longer than the first time, it finally came back. I picked it up and guess what? On June of '10, the same problem occured!  I took it back to the same store and inquired on how the warranty worked in regards to the replacement of the laptop. I was advised that it had to be sent back four times and then it would be an automatic replacement of a comparable model. Keep in mind that my PSP expired June 28, 2010 and I checked this in for service approximately a week prior. Wondering what the status of my laptop was, I looked up the service order number emailed to me and found out, to my surprise, it showed that I picked up my laptop.  I called the store, being on hold for 45 minutes, finally got to speak with someone and they advised that when they got it back. It still did not work and they were sending it back requesting a "junk out" (replacement). The GSA was surprised that no one had called to advise me of this and advised me that even though my warranty expired, it would still be covered. I call the local store on Friday, July 2nd and was advised that the replacement request was denied and that the reason the laptop did not work when it was received back from service was because the memory was "dirty".  Finding this to be hard to believe, I contact some local reputable businesses as well as HP to inquire on "dirty" memory and none of these individuals have ever heard of this. I am now lead to believe that the "warranty" department did not want to replace the laptop and came up with a "reason" to not have to do so. If you are looking to purchase a laptop with an extended warranty from BB, do your research first! If you are told that the fourth time to service is an automatic replacement, that is not always the case. Tim of St Petersburg, FL     7/6/10  1. Turned on computer one morning and the monitor kept going to sleep. 2. Hooked up monitor to another computer and it worked fine. 3. Returned computer to Geek Squad at the store where it was purchased. 4. With extended warranty, we purchased they still charged us $99.00 5. After one week, they told us they had to send it back to HP and it would take a month. 6. After three weeks, they called us (on the wrong number) and told us it was ready to pick up. 7. After picking it up and taking it home, we reinstalled to find out that nothing was done to it and was exactly the way it was a month before. 8. Called the store and found out they were closing early for the holiday (July 4th); being that it was only 6:30, we called and were put on hold. After a few minutes, we were disconnected. 9. We redialed and let the phone ring for 25 minutes and no one from the store of Geek would pick up. I have worked many holidays, but the consumers deserve more respect than that. 10. We then called a 24 hour line for Best Buy and got a lot of attitude. I was very angry, I admit, but they were poking a bee hive with a stick. 11. She told me to call back tomorrow. And, oh by the way, she would not be there and we would have to start all over with someone else. Because we had to take it to the store where we bought it, we now travel almost 60 miles one away. Now, a second trip makes it a total 240! With no real resolution in sight, our frustration is off the scale. Please stop these people from screwing over the public. Now more than ever, people can not afford to be jerked around. I would love to receive any related emails from consumers this store and this chain have cheated!  J. Michael of York , PA     7/5/10  I brought in my computer ( under warranty) to be fixed. I told them it was the internal power plug that it would not charge when I plug in the adapter plug. I was told I would have to leave my computer for a week. This caused me great distress and I had to use computers at the libuary. I was unable to do my work. I was told my computer was repaired and ready for PU after a week, I went in and found they had NOT repaired the plug and had only replaced the adapter plug. I took it home and had the same problem, I called and emailed and was told to bring it back and that it would take another week. I can NOT be with out a computer for that long. They had a week to repair and did not do it the first time Vicki of Los Angeles, CA     6/16/10  This is my second attempt to have some sort of service with Best Buy. The first is a year ago, I tried to get the Geek Squad to come to my house and service my computer and got stood up with a no call and no show. This time I attempted to order a washing machine over the phone for delivery the next day being Sunday, after three attempts to try to speak to someone over the phone a gentleman named Carlos answer after the third call stating that he would have someone in that dept. give me a call back for services.   After sitting hear all day waiting for the phone to ring at no avail did I get a call back. After not getting a call back I got up the next day and went to the store to speak with a manager. I don't remember the mans name however, we went to the dept in question and they didn't even have the machine that I wanted that was on there website. The manager that was helping me didn't even try to sell me another model just we don't have that model. I then asked him what he was going to do to rectify the situation and he was everything but helpful. He basically said that there was nothing he could do to help me at this point, they don't do same day delivery and as I had tried to get this done yesterday for delivery today I felt there should have been some sort of exception. To say the least I will never set foot in anymore of there stores. If you are looking for customer service that is not the place to go. Stephen of Montgomery Village, MD     6/13/10  I bought a Dell Computer Studio XPS 32 days ago and it went into infinite re-boot mode this morning. I spent over an hour on the phone with Geek Squad. They couldn't fix it so I took it to Best Buy locally. They said it was the display card and it would need to be sent away for repair. It will take 2-3 weeks according to the tech. I had to sign a contract agreeing to hold Best Buy harmless for any incidental damage to the machine. How absurd is that? At this point I will be without a computer for 2-3 weeks. I may have lost all of my data due to the Geek Squad attempts to "restore." Who knows what it may cost. Charlotte of Leesburg, VA     6/4/10  Two weeks ago as of June 3rd I dropped off my lap top to be repaired and was told it would be back in two weeks. I called last night and was told it was in shipping. Called today and told it was not in shipping, then told it was. I was told it would not be here for another two to three business days which would be at least 4 to 5 days from today.   Asked about a loaner lap top because of family leaving the country and needing the lap top for communication. I was then told that they don't have a loaner program but I could BUY A NEW LAP TOP to use while I wait for mine to return.  So the two week promise has turned into a lie, and I don't think I should have to BUY a new one because the geek squad can't do their jobs in a timely manner as they promised.  Brenda of Oklahoma City, OK     6/3/10  Purchased HP G60-635DX Notebook with 2 year extended warranty on 1/23/10 for a total of $773.70. On February 5th, I could not get computer to turn on and 2 of the keys on the keyboard were loose. I took my computer to Best Buy to Geek Squad and gentleman popped the battery in and out 3 times and it turned on. He snapped the keys in place and he also noticed that a 3rd key was loose and snapped that one in place. I indicated that I probably should return this laptop and he said no it was fine now.   On February 22, I opened my laptop and noticed 3 more keys fell off the computer. It was not dropped or mishandled in any manner. It sat on my desk for the most part. I took it back to Best Buy and showed the gentleman at Geek Squad how the keyboard keys were loose and brought the ones with me that had fallen off. He indicated that I would have to send my laptop off for repair at a cost of $179 for a new keyboard and that it would take approximately 4 weeks. As I use this laptop for work, I could not be without a computer for that length of time and I said that I needed a replacement since I believe this product was a lemon. He laughed and said "good luck, you'll never get them to replace it".   I came home and called the corporate office of Best Buy and spoke to a man named Brian. He said I should call Hewlitt Packard since it was their product and not Best Buy's responsibility. I indicated that since I had purchased it at Best Buy, I felt they should stand behind the products they sell. He told me to contact the store manager but there was nothing he could do. I called the store and spoke to Chrissy who indicated that the MOD was unavailable and with a customer. I told her what had happened and she reiterated the store policy of returns within 14 days of purchase. I then placed a dispute with American Express (the credit card I purchased the laptop with) and am still waiting for a final response. Mary of Yorktown, VA     4/12/10  At one point or another we all need computer repair help and I am no different. I found myself in need at the worst possible moment. In the middle night, when everything is closed and the night before a 15 page midterm report is due. I called the Geek Squad online support department for help and was charged for the $149 for their award winning virus removal service. They connected to my pc and attempted to remove the problem. After a couple of hours and a whole lot of coffee and nail biting they call me back and say there is nothing more that they can do. They said the virus is too embedded to be removed without causing further damage and system instability.   I get off the disappointing phone call and am still sweating because this report is 35% of my overall grade in this course. I go back to google to search for some sort of help or alternative solution when I find SecureRemoteSupport.com who provides online services and have a No Fix No Pay guarantee and are open 24 hours. Wow that would be nice if Geek Squad offered the same promise! Within an hour they had diagnosed the virus and had removed it completely for $79. And best of all, they were able to recover all but the last paragraph I had written of that paper. Apparently Geek Squad isnt as good at their job as Secure Remote Support is. Lucas of Camas, WA     4/6/10  I have teenage twin boys who like the internet a bit too much. They are perpetually plugged into these machines so much that I would swear the iPod appendage they have grown actually seems normal. So it was bound to happen that they would eventually need their notebooks cleaned up and swept for virus. We took them to the Best Buys Geek Squad and they told us it would be a few days and they would call us when they were done.   A week later of the boys alerts me that he needs his computer for a paper he has to write. I call the Best Buys Geek Squad and inquire about the computers when I am told that they have been extra-ordinarily busy and that it would another few days. I asked for a specific number of days and was told that he couldnt give me and exact figure. So we waited another 5 days and I call again. Still there is no progress so we head down to the store. When we arrive was ask for our property back and leave immediately. When we get home I look up some alternatives to the Best Buys Geek Squad Run Around.   I came across Secure Remote Support and I actually didnt have to take the computers anywhere. I just visited their website and selected a button on their website and gave them permission to connect to the laptops over the internet. And away the technicians went working on their computers remotely. It was like there was a virtual technician in our home working on it without having to have a stranger in our home. Within 2 hours the computers were scan, swept and sped up. Their service was fast, friendly and efficient. It was everything my Best Buys Geek Squad experience was not. Thanks Best Buys Geek Squad for wasting over 2 weeks of our time and introducing me to Chris at secureremotesupport.com. Lucas of Camas, WA     4/6/10  After learning that my son tried "reinstalling windows" to fix a virus infection he had gotten on our family computer I went into a state of panic. This kid knows just about as much about computers as I do - next to nothing. Sure enough, when I looked at the computer later that day the internet wasnt working and it would only boot up half of the time. I called (------------------) to get some help with my situation. It was difficult, first, to get them to answer the phone and second, to talk to me patiently and explain the situation in language I could understand. I felt overwhelmed with technobabble that I did not understand and felt that I was being talked down to about the situation. Im sorry I'm not a computer expert - I was explaining the situation the best I knew how - the internet wasn't working and it was having trouble starting at all! I arranged for one of their technicians to come to the house to check it out. Long story short, the guy who came to assess the situation was very knowledgeable but was late and made fun of my son for having tried to reinstall windows. Not something you'd expect from such a large company that supposedly hired qualified, intelligent and helpful technicians. The technician was able to switch everything back with some kind of disc, after about two hours. But, not only was he rude, but I was charged an incredulous amount of money for something the tech described as "a quick fix". After he left I got online to check reviews for the company only to learn that plenty of people have had similar run ins with this type of service (I learned I should be thankful the guy even showed up at all, actually). Upon further reading, I found a company called Secure Remote Support which offers the same types of service as Best Buy Geek Squad and called them out of curiosity to see what they would have charged for the same repairs. I was blown away when they quoted a fraction of the price of the company I'd just paid big bucks to. (You live you learn, right?) I'm glad I've got my computer working. Sure, It cost a lot and I had to deal with the attitude of a smart mouth kid, but my computer WAS fixed. Geek Squad has been a reliable company for a few things but I assure you, never again will I turn to them for computer repairs unless it's a last resort. Since this incident, I've called on Secure Remote Support twice (Once for spyware removal, and once to recover some data I'd lost when the other tech reinstalled everything) and they always deliver top quality service. They even offered me a promotion on optimization that I took advantage of. I like going to a company that values their customers and takes pride in the work they do, and Im glad I've finally found that company. Jeremy of Kelso, WA     4/5/10  Last night my computer just stopped working. I usually leave it on and connected to the internet and have never seemed to have any problems. Today I took it to the closest repair company to me, Geek Squad and had them figure out what is wrong. I paid a $75.00 diagnosis and left it, feeling like it was in good hands. I got a call about 5 hours later and from someone from Geek Squad telling me that my power supply had gone bad. I asked what it would cost to replace and he gave me a price of $99 for the power supply and another $50 for installation. I told him that Id have to call him back in a few minutes after I spoke to the other bread winner in the house.   I took that opportunity to call around and price out what other business charged for the same procedure. One place I called, Secure Remote Support, quoted me $39 for the part and another $25 for the labor. Thats a savings of almost $100. I called Geek Squad back and asked if they price matched and was told that they did not. So I am picking up the computer later today and having Secure Remote Support take care of it tomorrow. It really does pay to shop around. Secureremotesupport-dot-com saved my day. ashley of Medford, OR     3/30/10  I puchased a gateway laptop computer on 9/28/09 which the computer is still under warranty. I took it back because there was a problem with it of cutting off after a short while of being on. After going back and forth with the computer they finally agreed that the computer was faulty. However they refuse to replace it or give me my money back for this computer. First they told me I had to pay $40.00 for them to create a recovery disk, that would fix the problem, then after they made a disk they said it wasn't the problem that they want me to pay $70.00 to have it shipped somewhere to get fixed and they can't garantee that it could be fix.  I ask for a replacement with a new computer or my money back, they refused. I told them that I purchased the computer from Best Buy and it wasn't my place to contact gateway it was there's because that's where they got the computer from. And they are to one's who dealt with gateway. So the told me, they contacted gateway and they said the would not replace the computer.  I told Fred that I wanted him to document everything including the fact that they and gateway refuse to replace the computer and refuse to give me a full refund. If a product is faulty under the manufactors warranty they or the place of purchased should be made to replace the merchandise or give a full refund. I use this computer to log songs and lessons in at the church to make things a little less complicated for me and spent a lot of money to get to a point to where I can do this.  The physical damage is that due to my health condition which is Porasis gets aggravated by stress and beleive me when I say this has been very stressful. I've made numerous trips in order to resolve this problem and trying to get someone to help me. I put my neck out on the line to use this computer at church and you can't use something that was broken to start off with. Please Help me get my money back or a new computer, please Pamela of Fremont, NC     3/22/10  Took my computer in for Service Feb 26. I called on March 3rd because Geek Squad didn't show anything on my computer. Amazingly not long after I called they updated their site to say the computer was recieved. No more was done until I called on the 10th and was told it had been waiting for parts and they were finaly in. And amazingly enough later that day the website was updated to say that the parts were recieved.  Called on the 12th my computer was to be back the following day and they told me it was still being repaired. Called Monday the 15th and they say oh the parts just came in today you should have it sometime mid to late week. Let's remember it was due back on the 13th, they had all the parts on the 10th and yet now on the 15th they have all the parts and still no update on the website.  Do I think they even have my computer? No I don't because it seems to depend on who I talk to as to the status of my computer n updates are put into the website unless I call, and every agent has a different answer so I don't think anyone really knows where my computer is much less what is being done on it if anything.  I have clients waiting for reports that I cannot get out until I get my computer back. I assured them they would be out today since my computer should have been received by Saturday. I now can not give them any kind of timeline because I don't believ a word they say. I am liable to lose these customers because the reports were due on the 10th.  I have also spent time on the phone trying to find out and getting different stories and having no one actually do what they say they will do and the aggravation of having to call them on lie after lie it has taken time away from my business and I basically am dead in the water for my business. Doris of Port Mansfield, TX     3/15/10  I bought a Macbook Pro from Best Buy in December, 2008 with a 3 year service contract. After one year the computer charging system was damaged do to mosture. When I took it to the Geek Squad they said it needed to be sent to their service center. I made a point to ask if they would contact me before any repairs were made because I knew the hard drive was OK. They assured me they would. (which was stated in the agreement) After two weeks I received a call that my computer was not repairable and that I was approved to get another one. I called them back about my data on the hard drive and they told me they had junked it and there policy was they couldn't return to the old one to the store and they don't recover data. I was never told it was my responsibility to retrive the data. I told them there was no power to the unit to access the data and all I wanted was a prognosice. Not to junk my computer. After spending several days dealing with customer relations. I was told I they would not return my computer.  I went to the store to pick up a replacement computer. I had to pay an additional $42.00 in sales tax the way the figured the cost for the replacement. And was told that my service contact was was now void because of the replacement. A loss of $300 to me. This whole experience was devestating to me. With the loss of a years of family photos, personal documents, business contacts and information, hundreds of itunes and much more. And then to be treated as a complainer. They could have retuned the other computer or repaired it for less but it was to much effort. I was lied to and ripped off at every turn. Amazing how little they cared and continued to rip me off. If there was only a way I could return the favor.  Kenneth of Seal Beach, CA     2/21/10  I took my laptop in to Best Buy on 1/13/10, to have the keyboard serviced due to some minor spillage. At the time, I spoke with Geek Squad agent Billy who supplied me with forms to sign and information regarding the shipping/service of my laptop. I explained to him that I did notice that my screen had some dust-like matter on the inside of it (mostly on the upper right-hand corner. I told him that it was only noticeable by me once I put a light-colored wallpaper. He identified that it was there and wrote down for the screen to be replaced as well, under my protection plan.  I showed him the condition that I had my computer in, clean/shiny & with no scratches. I explained to him that I would like it covered at all times to prevent damage or scratches. He explained that my laptop would be handled correctly, is in good hands and took it off to be serviced. I returned for it on 1/28, the day after I got an e-mail stating that it was finished being serviced. I spoke with a Geek Squad agent by the name of Eric, about why my computer appeared to have been left out in the open because it was uncovered and the screen so filfthy (with fingerprints visible). He told me that that was normal procedure with all computers serviced. I noticed that the top of my laptop (screen area) was also very shaky to the touch and so naturally, I was questionable as to why that was.  I also spoke with a manager there, by the name of Johanna, as to why that was and she also said it was normal. I was a bit skeptical as a customer about the truthfulness of their observations/ claims so, I left the computer there so that I can come back & consult with Store Management the next day. I had told the Geek Squad agent, Eric, to cover my computer & don't let anyone touch it until I return.  Unknowingly, I had to spend some time in the hospital over the next few days for an underlying health condition. I figured that my computer would be covered & not touched for that time period. I returned to the store on 2/2/10 and one of the Geek Squad agents proceeded to bring my laptop computer out to me saying, "Look miss, your laptop has been cleaned by us!" I got angered with them & told them, "Why did the store violate my rights as a consumer and clean my property without my approval first?"  I then inspected the laptop further at that point, only to discover that there were blotches from some type of cleaning solution all over my screen and scratches all around the rim of the computer, from where the webcam is, extending all the way around the rim. I was shocked and infuriated.  At that time a manager, by the name of Matt, came out to speak with me. He identified the scratches and also a visible dent in the media player sensor area. Instead of him offering me a replacement computer because his staff went against company policy and damaged someone else's (the consumer) property, he told me that he had to again send my laptop out for another 2 weeks. I refused because I need my computer for business purposes. But, I knew that I also couldn't take it out of the store for the sole purpose it would void any damage that was done to my computer on behalf of the Best Buy staff, once it's back in the customers possession.  The General Manager of the store, Michael P., refused to address the situation that day, even though he was there. He also proved to be very careless of the situation and refused to return my phone calls to him the day after. I will not have my computer being sent away for 2 weeks so that Best Buy can cover their tracks and load my computer with a lot of refurbished parts.  That is not the way that I had initially purchased it & I do not trust the store at this point! I should be rightfully entitled to something new of equal or lesser value or a full refund of my money, which the store is refusing to do at this time. I am appalled and refuse to let them make the decisions for my product and my money!  My laptop's screen and framing sustained scratches and blotches from a cleaning solution/method used by Best Buy staff in-store, against my will as the customer. If I wanted it cleaned, I would have done it myself. I was given no further options by their staff, other than give us your property again to be serviced for an unknown length of time.  I was refused a replacement laptop or full refund of my money. I feel like the store now controls my property and my money. I now have to conduct my business through a friend's computer, until this matter is settled. This situation has also caused me much stress, as I don't know who could be doing what with my laptop within the Best Buy store, as I take the time out to even write this e-mail! Karen of Freeport, NY     2/5/10  I was almost ran off the road by a geek squad van, and i went into a besyby to see why my ipod wasn't holding a charge. it was said to me that they would replace the old ipod and use it's parts to build a new one, and i found that statement to be fraudulent, because gerod who told me this flirted with me, and when i denounced his advances his manager told me to "get back" and called the police on me. That manager witnessed garod flirting with me in the back of the store, where they claimed they were going to prove that they actually did run a battery test on my ipod.   I suspected that garod was lying, and perhaps was trying to force his agenda on me. Garod's manager made a racist remark to me when i refused garod's romantic jargon, and called the police on me, the arlington height's police said they didn't find me wrong or liable and they took a report. The wilmette ploice told me to get a lawyer and to contact the better business bureau. I believe they sexually harrassed me. They aggresively tried to get me to prchase a car charger for the ipod and they said the battery was bad.  melanie of Wilmette, IL     1/22/10  It started when I bought a dell laptop last year. It is vista. I bought it from Best Buys. I had it about 4 months and kept having trouble with it from then on. First they told me I had to pay 80 dollars to look at it. That was fine then they told me it was the hard drive so they had to send it out to dell. When it came back they said it wasnt the hard drive that the geek squad was wrong so they now have to install all my programs for another 100 dollars. Then I got mad so I told them to pack it up and I would take care of it. They then said they would do it for free. So I took it home and it was doing the same thing.   I called dell support and they told me that I did not buy it from them on line to go back to the geek squad which would cost me more money. So then I brought it to a computer guy in the area and he told me it was the hard drive so i had him fix it and it cost me another 190 dollars. Here I am 3 weeks later and the same thing is happening. Blue screen crash on it restart it works. Yesterday I lost all my stuff had to restore on safe mood. I am very disappointed with this dell lap top. I do have a desk top xp and no problems. I want to know what do I do now. Invest more money or throw it in the river that's how disgusted I am. Have you ever had all these problems from anyone else and tell them what they should do... I don't have a warranty on it so could you give me some imput on this. thank you susan of manville, NJ     1/17/10  I purchased a Belink N Wireless USB adapter from Best Buy on 12/18/2009 and before I purchased the unit, I asked their Geek Squard buy if the unit can work with Windows 7. The Geek Squard guy told me it will. After I got it home and try to install it with my sister's machine, it did not work. My sister try to return the unit on 12/27/2009 to the store but they said they did not carry that model that I bought.  I then went to the store myself and try to return that but they still insisted that the unit is not from the store. One of thei manager, Faruk, said they never carry that model and the unit is not from their stor. I asked if it is possible they have a sticker over the plastic wrap that they scanned but he insisted I bought the unit from somewhere else and try to return to their store and said "thank you very much, next".  As I walking out of the store, their security said something like have a nice day and don't come back or something in that regards. I was so [upset] and I think I flipped them off. My sister then went back home and dug up the plastic wrapper from their trash can and indeed there was a sticker that matched the product code on the receipt. I went back to the store again on 12/28 and trying to prove they were wrong but then was met by Andre H., Best Buy's Soter Service Manager. The first word out of his mouth was "I need to ask you to leave the store now". He said I have created a scene and flipped his employees off and he had me on tape. I tried to explain that I found the wrapper with the sticker matched the receipt but he said "I have told you that we never carry that product". I said what about the sticker on the wrapper that proves the product is indeed from your store but he said the sticker is from the store but the product is not. He said "don't ever come back again". I then left with disguss.  I called their corporate to complain and talked to Helena telling her what had happened, how I was treated, and blammed of cheating. Helena was nice and called the store and got Joey from the store on the line but Joey said they went through their inventory and they never carry that product and still insisted that I try to return a unit not from their store. cost of the unit, 4 trips to the store and the humiliation of accused of "not honest" in front of other customers and asked to leave and never return to the store in front of my wife and other customer. Kenny of Carlsbad, CA     1/1/10  This unit was trouble from the start! I only got it to get the latest X/P, as my 8 year old COMPAC would have to be doctored for that system. I never had any problem with the COMPAC// Ive had my emachine in best buy 19 times & their geek came to my home, played around on the keyboard for about 10 minutes & proclaimed that it would be fine. needles to say that was & will be the last time I will deal with them.  the first time it was in there they sent it back with an old hard drive in a box, said they put in a new one. when i started to use it it had a virus 7 other junk that took me 2 days to get rid of. There were 18 other times whitch proved to me that best buy's geeks are just that. One of these times, they were going to send it back to the factory for repair or replacement.  after 2+ months I went in to see if I could get it back/ they looked all around the shop, 7 finaly found it in a back room, still bearing several of the previous stickers bearing my name & a bar code for i/d I've been crippleing along with it now & I cant understand why the D.V.D. trey is out now. My beat up old COMPAC THAT THEY TURNED THEIR NOSES UP AT never had anything done to it except to add gigs.  I wish I had this info in this site before i bought this junkysrd. I realy would apreciate any help your atorneys may get for this problem. this is a model t3516 serial # xrc6a 800 04619  Purchased 12/2/06 with time out in BEST BUY 19 visuits & a geek aperance at home with no substantial results. I guess short of guting this case & puting in COMPAC components its imposible to keep this THING going right. I realy believe they sold me a unit that they were haveing trouble with// why would have to take it to a remote part of the store ( not even a repair or tech. area ) to make it ready for use. I had pulled a sealed box from their shelf & this is the way im foisted. I will also be glad to give testimony on emachine & best buy performance! william of tamps, FL     12/28/09  Bought TV of Sam sung 65 " and geek squad consultation . Geek squad never returned my call and had to go after installation with third party .  TV did not work after few days . best buy was not ready to take off the TV and ask me to pay for installation and to take it off .  Despite my request for geek squad to come and paid 100 for consultation intention for installation as TV did not work it is responsibility of Best buy to do the work and replace it , Instead they wanted to charge me 350 to take out and install it .  On top of that Kevin guy manager from fair lake Fairfax was very rude in his behavior . I had terrible experienced with best buy .  Bimal of Fairfax, VA     12/16/09  I purchased an Insignia 47" 1080p HD TV on 8/28/09. On 12/1 the TV picture went blank. The sound worked but there was no picture. I purchased the extended warranty just in case this happened. I called the warranty company (Geek squad) and was scheduled for a repair on 12/8. I asked them to search for a sooner appointment at the same time. On 12/7 I called back to check on the status of a sooner appointment and found out that they had cancelled the appointment scheduled for 12/8. They then set an appointment for 12/11. I was contacted at 3:00 pm on 12/10 about the appointment being cancelled again because their only repair technician got hurt. The re-scheduled my appointment for 12/17. Having to go longer than 2 weeks without a product that was only just over 3 months old is riduculous. I spent well over $1000 on the TV, mount, tax and the cable to run it. I will never again purchase another product from Best Buy.  Fred of Springdale, AR     12/10/09  In April 2009 I purchased a Toshiba laptop from Best Buy. I purchased a carrying case, extended warranty, and some operating software. The computer has worked without concern or incidence for several months. On Friday November 6, 2009, I was out of town with my laptop. I turned it on and as soon as I began to enter a word to search on the internet, the keyboard locked up completely and no keys would function at all. I turned the computer off, then turned it back on and the screen immediately went into BIOS with no keys working.  On Tuesday November 10th I returned the laptop to the Best Buy Store in South County where it was purchased. The attendant at the Geek Squad desk turned the computer on and got the same result as I had. She filled out a service request and said someone should call me within 3-5 days. Seven days went by and no one called me. I tried calling several times over the weekend and was told that the Geek Squad desk was too busy to answer the phone.  By Tuesday November 17th, I was so upset and frustrated, I called the Best Buy Consumer Relations in Minnesota. I got a very understanding and sympathetic representative. She placed me on hold and called the store herself. When she came back, she said they assured her that my laptop was fixed and that I could pick it up immediately. I went to the store that evening a picked up my laptop. I turned it on while at the store and the home screen came up correctly, so I placed the laptop back into its case. That weekend, I went out of town again and took the laptop with me.  On Thursday November 19th I turned on the laptop in the hotel in Kentucky and opened up the internet. As soon as I entered letters to begin a search, the keyboard locked up again and when I turned it off then back on it went immediately into the BIOS screen with no keyboard function. Absolutely nothing had been fixed at all. I did not have the store phone number with me so I called directory information only to find out that this particular store chooses not to list its number with directory information. I had to get the number to a different store, call that store, and get the number from them. (how bizarre is this?)  When I called the store and told them that I was out of town with a laptop that obviously wasn't fixed, I got a very rude manager on the phone who told me that maybe I should go buy a usb keyboard and try that. I could not believe what I was hearing. I was going to have another weekend with no computer and have to make another trip to the same Geek Squad who obviously didn't fix the issue the first time.  On Tuesday November 24th, I took the laptop back to the Best Buy store and was pleased to see the original attendant working that was there the first time. At least, she knew what was going on...the laptop was never fixed from the first time I brought it in. The attendant again told me that someone would call me in 3-5 days.  On Friday November 27th, I received a message on my cellphone from the Geek Squad stating that they couldn't fix the issue and they needed my permission to send it off to be fixed. I immediately called the store back and was told that the Geek Squad desk was too busy to answer the phone but I was assured by the person who answered the phone that she would relay the message to the Geek Squad that I gave my permission to send the laptop off to be fixed. For the past two weeks I have heard nothing from anyone at Best Buy. I assumed the process of fixing my laptop was well underway. WRONG!  Today, December 9th, I received a call from a Geek Squad member asking for my permission to send my laptop away to be fixed. I became livid. I was transferred to a 'manager' named Drew. He said he could not find any notation that I have ever given my permission for the computer to be sent off. He also said that he showed notes that the Geek Squad had attempted to contact me and left several messages for me over the previous two weeks.  I simply can not believe this is happening. I tried to complain, but was cut off repeatedly by Drew saying he did not want to argue the situation and that there was nothing he could do at this point except get my permission to send the computer away to be fixed. I told him that I felt that this is more of a personnel issue and he said that he can't help that since 60% of his workforce is new and they make mistakes. I will be calling Consumer Relations again and filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau to at least let others know to beware: Best Buy is all about sales and has no concern about service. Shaughn of St. Louis, MO     12/9/09  I took my Sony computer to the Geek Squad on Nov. 21, 2009. The guy I spoke with told me it would only be a week and a half and my computer should be back. Well I call today 12-7-09 and they tell me they sent it to Sony cause it was still covered under manufactor's warranty. So I ask the guy who answered the phone if he could tell when my computer would be back and they tell me I have to call Sony myself and find out when my computer would be ready. Well 1st of all they are the ones who sent it and they gave me an order # to call the Geek Squad and find out when me computer would be back and all they do is give me a number to Sony and call them myself and get an answer. I am not happy at all with Best Buy and the Geek Squad. Clay of Alabaster, AL     12/8/09  I brought my computer to the Best Buy store located in Staten Island on Richmond Avenue to be repaired. I was told by the by their Geek Squad that there was two possible actions I could take; the first was to pay to have them diagnose the problem and then if I wanted to have the computer repaired I would then pay for the cost. The second plan was to pay $200 up front and they would diagnose the computer and repair whatever was wrong. The advantage would be the diagnosis and repair would only cost $200 and no more.  I opted for the second plan I paid the $200 and signed their contract. When I was notified to come to the store to pick up the computer I was informed that the computer wasnt repaired because the problem was the Mother Board and the cost of replacing it would be too expensive. I explained to them I had a signed contract that stated any problems would be repaired. They agreed that that is what it states but they wouldnt fix it. I asked for my money back and they again refused they said I could use it towards the purchase of a new computer but only if I purchased it that day and in their store. I feel that a contract is a contract but they had me at a disadvantage since I need a computer so I was forced to buy a new one.  I lost all my data that was on the old computer, spent days reloading my old programs on the new computer which some didnt work correctly. I lost at least a 100 hours of my time just getting my programs & data back on the computer. Robert of Staten Island, NY     11/27/09  i bought a Dell laptop in august with 3 year warranty from best buy. i heard good things about geek squad. the first weekend my battery died in less than 3 hours. there were 2 choices of dell laptops and the biggest difference, the reason i paid more was battery life. one said up to 3 hours and the other said up to 5 hours. i went into the store within the first couple weeks after buying the laptop and told the customer service people. I was told i had to either trade them for a new computer or call geek squad to come to me. I didnt understand why i had to leave the store, call the geek squad and have them come to me when they were right there. i went home and called the 800 number to make an appointment and was told i could have gone in and been helped there. i didnt need to make an appointment. i was pretty frustrated by now since i stood in line so long each time i went. (i recently purchased 2 cell phones as well and was given the wrong charger, waited in line at customer service only to be told to find another one that was the correct one and stand in line again). I just forgot about it and thought i'd do it later since it was such a hassle.  2 weeks ago my laptop froze. i took it in to best buy and after waiting in a huge line again the geek squad took it and promised they would know what was wrong with it within an hour and call me. i went home and waited 2 hours. i called them. after ringing and ringing i was finally told i would receive a call within an hour. after 2 more hours i called them. it rang and rang. no one ever answered.  i called customer service and a lady answered. i was very very frustrated by now and was upset, but not screaming. i told her the problem explaining again, she interrupted and was very rude and told me she would have geek squad call me back. the store waas about to shut and i said i needed to talk to them now. i was already told 4 hours ago i would receive a call at least giving me a time frame when this would be fixed.  i run my business of my computer, i was on my way to san francisco an hour away, at a reserved hotel to meet up with some potential clients when this happened. I needed to know what time i should tell my clients i will be in the city. i finally talked to the guy who helped me the first time. he said the problem could be anything they had no idea. it had been 4 hours. they were linking it up tonight and it would be worked on all night including "4 am." he promised me if he had to come in himself at 4am he would. and that he would call me at 9am sharp. the next morning 11am, no call. i called geek squad, no answer. i called customer service, no answer. i called the 800 number, they put me on hold while they were on hold for 20 minutes. i was then told that they still hadnt had a chance to look at it. theyve been busy, understaffed. had i know that nearly 20 hours later they still would have no idea what was wrong or how long it would take, i would have left right away, taken my business elsewhere and been able to head to san francisco. i told them to unplug everything i was coming to get the laptop and take it to someone more competent. i cant believe i bought a 3 year warranty for this. no help still at this point with the battery, i explained during the first visit for the laptop freeze problem about the battery. i was then told to contact dell because they had nothing to do with the battery. When i initially turned in my laptop i mentioned repeatedly i dont care what it costs, i have my business on here and i would pay triple if i had to. I was losing up to $500 everyday this was not available. Cost was not the issue.  the lines are horrible, even though i know about computers and tried to explain what i was doing when the computer froze, no one wanted to listen and they treated me like a kid. when i came to pick up my laptop a geek sqaud employee named kevin helped me. he told me to go here and let you know there is a lack of employees and help, they ones who are there are stressed out, incompetent and rude. ive bought about $2000 worth of merchandise in the last 6 months (i wont even start with the problems ive had with rewardzone) and i will NEVER buy anything ever again from best buy. especially no warranty items or anything i might have a problem with. i took my laptop to the top computer repair people in san francisco and they diagnosed within 2 hours, called me and told me how much and when it would be ready. These are people who recently repaired the computer equiptment on the oil tanker that spilled in the bay area. 2 men run this shop, not an entire geek squad, and when i was there they were available, friendly and knowledgeable. i picked up my fixed laptop 2 days later. it needed a new harddrive which i paid for. I have 3 years warranty from [Best Buy], 1 year from dell, and i paid overall $400 including an external harddrive i was told to buy at best buy. My laptop itself was maybe $700 without the service plan. I'm calling Dell after this as well and explaining. Ironically, my father called 4 days later and was headed to santa rosa to buy a computer. he asked me if i recommended anywhere. i told him my experience with [Best Buy] and that he should go to [competitor] in the south bay where the TRUE techies go. From now on I will tell everyone this and all my other experiences i've had with the horrible service. they say you get what you pay for, i paid a good chunk for horrible service. i would like a refund on my 3 year warranty as well as the external hard drive i shouldnt have had to purchase. during the time i picked up my laptop i set my folder of papers and warranty information down on the counter, i was so frazzled and had many things to carry that i left the entire receipt, warranty information, and backup discs there. i called as soon as i got to san francisco and couldnt find them. of course i didnt get through at all for 2 hours. when i did however i was told they would look for them but they hadnt seen them. i called the next day, nothing. i called 2 days later adn then was told i could come in and get a duplicate receipt and the backup discs i could get from dells website and the receipt was also covering the best buy warranty. i went in and got a receipt and nothing else. hope i wont need anything later. I spoke to Dell who is williing to extend my warranty and give me a new harddrive, but i have already purchased a harddrive and cannot refund it. They told me to call the 800 number and get my warranty back that i bought from them. I've emailed them at bestbuycares.com, ive posted on forums, i've called repeatedly. The people who go to that store obviously have alot more time than money. no one deserves to be put through so much. heather of santa rosa , CA     11/23/09  I paid for a 5 year warranty on my washing machine and recently it dumped 15 gallons of water on the floor of my 4 year old house! I called them the first time and they said they had to do research and would call me back in for hours. Called them a second time and they said the technician would be her saturday. I personally called the technician and his office does not work on the weekends and the earliest would be monday. The third call they gave me a request for another repair center that isnt even listed and has not called. My washer has been down since wednesday and I have a wife and 3 kids worth of laundry that is piling up. At this point what is the point of the warranty being offered if its not effective? Robert of Lubbock, TX     11/21/09  I had purchased a 50 inch Toshiba TV in 12/16/06. I had no problems with the TV till about 6 months or so later, when the TV all of a suden whent black, the only display I would recive is the TV options menu and when I tryed to play a DVD on my seperate DVD surround sound, all I would recive is sound; Meaning that there is something wrong with this TV!! Since that first day I have been trying to get the TV fixed!! The first time dayle came out and looked at the TV was when I lived off on cummberland road, which when I ask Best Buy service if they have any of the reports of him going out to that adrres they say no "which is a littile funy to me" Since that first time Dayle looked at the TV he stated it was the projection light and I stated to him why would you think that? You can see that the projection light is on in the back of the TV, but yet he ordered that part and some other part. Well i saw Dayle again about one month and a couplde of weeks later when he came back to install the part. Dayle goeas to open the back of the TV and see's that the light is not the problem, he goes to move a wire and the TV turns on!   The TV works great for about a few months, till it happens again. I take a day off of work to meet him out there. he arrives and grabs the remote and the TV turns on and Dayle goes on his way. The same problem happens again and but this time the TV turned on after a few day's, so I had called to cancell the appointment. Guess what? The same thing happens again go figure. this time Dayle comes out and orders what I think would be a new mother board. So here I am taking more days off of work to try to get this prblem fixed. I see Dayle about three weeks later to install the part. the TV works great till you gussed it a few months later the TV does the same thing that it had done on day one!  I have another guy come out on a Saturday and again it took about three weeks to get some one out here and here comes the good part he grabs the remote and the TV turned on for him and he is gone. Two weeks later Dayle is back out here at the house because the TV is still doing the same problem and he orders another part. About three days late we called Geek squad to change are scheduled appoint ment for a Saturday, because I can take any more time off of work really anymore because I am just to busy and it takes me about two hours round trip to get to work. We had filled a complaint against Dayle this time and we stated to Dorthy the supervisor in charge that we did not want to file a commplaint if it was going to bight us in the butt in the long run. Guess what it looks like it did bight us in the butt. a few days later after scheduling the appointment the mannager Marcus I think his name was called me and stated the only person they had workin on Saturday was Dayle and I told him great send him I want to watch my TV again in the living room and that I had no problem with him comming out here. At this point I have been with out a TV for a month and a couple of weeks!   So today is November 14th and today was the day that they were going to fix my TV. This morning I recive a call from the Geek Squad, but I was unable to answer the phone call, but I called back very quickly and spoke to a lady very quickly before I was transfered to a supervisor who told me nothinf really but that I would hear from one of the upper mannagement people with in four hours. It has been over four hours and no call. Michael of Stockton, CA     11/14/09  I purchased a computer from best it was an HP that they had on sale. The one I purchased I was told it had been optimized by geek sqad already and this was why it cost an additional 40.00 Dollars. I was then told that I had a 14 day no hassel return policy on the computer by the sales staff. There was no mention that the 40.00 Dallar geek squad fee was not refundable.  So this computer is defective after 3 days and I go to take it back for exchange. I find another computer that I like and I decided to get it for the exchange. I get to the counter and I am told that I will have to pay extra because they could not refund the 40.00 dollars that was spent on the optimizing of the original computer. I ended up having to pay more.  I get this computer home and after a week it is bad so I go and take it back and just ask for my money back. They tell me they cannot give me my 40.00 dollars back and then charge me an additional 15% or 84.00 dollars as a restocking fee. So now I am out 124.00 dollars because they sold me to defective computers. (still within the 14 day no hassel return policy). I would love to have a lawer tackle this one. Thank You Allen of Oneida, TN     11/8/09  I purchased a Toshiba laptop in May 2009. It was working fine until August 2009 when the computer suddenly stopped working. The fan was still running but there was no image on the screen. I called the Best Buy number to troubleshoot but I could not go further since the battery compartment was jammed and the phone tech told me not to force it open or the warranty may become invalid if it looked damaged. He asked me to take it to the nearest Best Buy and have them look at it.  Best Buy Geek Squad told me they would diagnose and call me within 24 hours to advise me if they could fix it there or need to send it out to service (The service center is in Chino, CA). I asked them to take care of my computer as it was in new condition and I didn't want it scratched or damaged. The GS tech assured me they would take good care of my laptop. I waited to no avail.  Finally, after two weeks, I called them and they told me they had been trying to reach me (I left the best number for them to reach me which is my cell). They instead called a residence phone number at a home where I do not spend much time. When I called they told me it was fixed. I asked them if they were sure. Then put me on hold and said oh no it wasn't and they would need to send it to the service center and needed my authorization. I expressed my concern of not having had an opportunity to back up my data since it went out suddenly and they told me they would back it up and I could come in and have the data transferred to my external drive. They told me they would call me when the back up was ready.  It was a week and I heard nothing. Finally, I called and the tech told me the computer was still there and the backup had not been completed. He apologized (the only apology I have ever received from Best Buy) and he said he would personally make sure the data was backed up and the computer shipped to the service center. It was finally shipped. It stayed over at the service center for more than three weeks. The hard drive was replaced.  I went to pick it up and the computer had many hairline scratches on the cover. The computer had a new hard drive but they advised me I would have to reload the operating system (even after the service center assured me that it would come with the same Toshiba drive it had when I purchased it including the operating system and basic software).  I was upset that the computer had obviously been damaged and that I had been mislead to believe that it would have the OS. I left it there and called corporate to no avail. I was upset that the service had taken almost two months, the computer was scratched, and the operating system still needed installing. I felt cheated as i left a new computer in their hands and now basically had a used and misused computer. Since no one in the Best Buy organization was willing to help me, I decided to pick it up and donate it to a disadvantaged child; however, when I brought it home to reload the system software, it stopped loading at about 40%. I left it running overnight and finally decided to retry the installation. It went blank again just as it had when it first broke down. I was back at square one more than two months later. I took it back to Best Buy and they told me they would have to send it back to the service center to replace the screen and they also indicated that perhaps the reinstallation/restore disks were bad. I don't believe this since the disks were unsealed and right out of the box.  I asked them for a new computer since I had already spent more time than I could afford trying to get this computer back in working condition and this would be the third major item being replaced. They replaced the entire bottom plate, the hard drive and now the screen. They indicated they could not do anything and would have to send it away again. They told me they would put a rush on the pickup to the service center. The service was disrespectful, unprofessional, and non customer-service oriented.  I called Toshiba yesterday and asked them what I should do, and they told me to send it to them and they would fix it or give me a new one. No one at Best Buy had ever told me that I could send it back directly to the manufacturer (It was still covered under the limited warranty since it is only a few months old). I told Toshiba I had dropped it off at Best Buy and since it was on a rush order to ship back to service center, I would call to find out if I could still retrieve it from Best Buy so that I could send it to Toshiba.  Toshiba processed my claim and indicated it would take a total of seven days to get the computer repaired or replaced and not weeks. I asked Toshiba why Best Buy never mentioned that I could go through Toshiba instead of the Geek Squad and the tech indicated that, that is how Best Buy makes its money...selling warranties...and then not having the full capacity to service the products. I called Best Buy and of course the computer was still there (they did not rush my computer anywhere...another misrepresentation of the truth). I picked up the computer and I am now waiting for the box from Toshiba. What an awful experience. In the meantime, I am without a laptop. I will be purchasing another laptop today since I am a graduate student with lots of work to complete and little time to be messing with the unreasonably look waits and slow response from Best Buy. I am hoping that Toshiba will be better.  I will never again purchase anything at Best Buy and I would never buy an extended warranty from Best Buy. This is not the first time, they have proven to be less than honest about their policies and they are totally cavalier in their response to the customer's concerns. My laptop is still not working after almost three months of service at Best Buy; I am behind in my school work; and I have spent over eight hours of my time waiting at the best buy geek squad counter. The laptop I purchased in May 2009 has been in repair longer than it has been in functioning status.  Willie of Hawthorne, CA     10/27/09  In August 2008 I purchased a Toshiba laptop computer from Best Buy in midtown Manhattan (note: this is not the location against which I am filing a complaint). The laptop made funny noises right out of the box when the hard drive was running. This developed into a situation in which I decided to take advantage of the 2-year protection plan I purchased with the laptop and take it into the Geek Squad for servicing. Because its location was more convenient for me, I chose the Best Buy Soho store at 622 Broadway in NYC. I told the GS "agent" what the problem was, left my laptop with them and was informed that I would get it back in about 2 weeks.   Not much incident here - I got it back in 2 1/2 weeks - but apparently, it was not properly fixed. I noticed that the funny screeching sounds from the hard drive still occurred, albeit less frequently, but nonetheless hoped that somehow the problem for which I had the laptop repaired in the first place was remedied. Fast forward to Early June 2009 when the entire laptop quit working. I went back to Geek Squad at Best Buy Soho. There was only one agent working the counter that day - his name is Michael D. I gave him full background of my laptop's short history and explained that it simply would not operate now.   I waited in the store patiently for over 1 1/2 hours (as I did the first time I took it in) while he figured out what to do with it. He mentioned that the last time my laptop was "fixed," whoever took care of me made a mistake and it didn't have to be sent away, as the problem could have been easily solved in store. Now, after alternately tinkering with it and disappearing from my sight, he said that it would have to be sent away for servicing and I probably would not get it back for 3 weeks. I agreed, and waited for him to hand me some sort of paperwork for pick up. He did not. I asked him - three times in varying ways - don't I need paperwork to pick up my laptop? He replied every time, in effect, "No - we have your phone number on file and that's enough to look up your account." And added something about how he's trustworthy - "Don't you trust me?" or something like that.   Reluctantly, I left without my laptop or the vital recovery discs it came with (Mr. D said that the servicing center may need them). Three weeks went by. I received no call. Between the three week mark at which I should have received my repaired laptop and the 5 1/2 week mark when I finally did get it back, I made approximately 7 calls to Best Buy Soho. I can provide names and dates and what was discussed if necessary. Essentially, every time I called, whatever agent took the call had a difficult time locating my laptop, and asked if I had an order number. I did not, since Mr. D did not provide me with any.   Around the third time I called, a helpful agent named Michelle told me that they did not have my laptop because somehow it was sent to the wrong service center for repair. That center had to return it to BB, then they had to ship it out again to the correct facility. She was the only employee who gave me any reasonable answers. After a few more frustrating attempts at getting answers over the phone, I went to the store location in mid-July, found the manager right away, and made my complaint. A supervisor named Eric, with whom I had dealt on the phone and was entirely unapologetic and apathetic, suddenly rushed to the manager's side while I stated my issue. Eric was ordered to figure out what was going on with my situation.   I saw Michael D at the Geek Squad counter and went to him right away to inquire about my laptop and remind him of our meeting over 5 weeks ago. He claimed to not remember me, and adamantly said that he would never send a customer away without paperwork - in essence, calling me a liar. I told everyone involved that I was leaving that day with either my repaired laptop, a new laptop, or my money back in full. Miraculously, my repaired laptop was there, though no one had bothered to call to tell me it was ready.   Upon first inspection, the adapter didn't look like mine (I had given them my adapter along with the laptop and recovery discs), so I asked Mr. D, is that my adapter? I was not sure; it had been almost 6 weeks since I'd seen it. He replied, unequivocally, "Yes" (with a tone that implied 'of course'). He was nice enough to download Firefox and MS Office onto my unit to compensate for my being ridiculously inconvenienced and repeatedly blown off, as if I couldn't download Firefox or MS Office to my unit myself. I asked where my recovery discs were. They couldn't find them. Eric the supervisor disappeared supposedly to find the discs, but he never returned, and I was finally sent away with a crappy, malfunctioning adapter and none of my recovery discs.  K of Jersey City, NJ     10/16/09  Hello World, I have a larger story than most, but well detailed the bottom line, Best Buy Bellevue sold me a DVD player, sold me the extended protection but refused to service the device due to the price that they sold it for. Since they refused service, and refused to discuss this with me this leaves me with a contract that I dont trust at all as I dont believe they would fix any problems with this device due to that sale price. (The item was not As-Is)  I purchased a HT-X710T DVD/Audio system a cool but discontinued DVD player with Bluetooth streaming audio, USB video/MP3 playback and speakers at a great price even with the Black Tie coverage and found that Best Buy Geek Squad denied repair service of this unit. The local BestBuy had a Managers table setup with open box items that they wanted to get rid of and on one particular day (9/2) they put up a sign that said 50% off the last marked price. That made this device only $65 (was marked $130) and sold with speakers and a remote. The sales associates were surprised to see the price but were more than happy to sell me the device and the black tie Geek Squad coverage for this electronic device. The usual salesmen talk here, fully protected, if it doesnt work theyll send it off to the manufacture and theyll fully support me after the manufactures warrantee yeah I know I shouldnt have listen to it I run home with my new toy but upon setting it up I found that the remote did belong with this device, and my universal could not handle the all the unique features of this DVD/audio system. So I get online and find the model of the remote, call Samsung to ask what other remotes (including universal) may work with this device but only one remote can work. I write down the model and then drive back to BestBuy (~20 miles) and talk up their Home Theater team and we start digging through their remote drawers 30 minutes later we still could not locate the correct remote they then offered to sell me a universal remote but I told them my experience already with a universal its not made to handle this unique device. Then I told them that Samsung had quoted me $29+$10 S&H for the correct remote. The sales agent happily offered to give me an additional discount on the device to make it right for the customer and give me what I thought I purchased. So we take the $65 and subtract $40 and get a total cost of $25 + the Geek Squad coverage. Seriously a great bargain for me!  That night I get to playing with the device, I could use the very basic controls on the body of the device to start DVD playback but found that the screen was filled with artifacts (random colors/static) and was unacceptable. So having been sold on the Geek Squad Black Tie coverage the previous day I call the store and they say to bring it in and theyll send it out for manufacture warrantee! Cool saves me the shipping hassle and getting the details to have it done.   I take the device in and they accept it, it then takes 8 days for it to actually ship out from the Bellevue Best Buy to their service/repair station in Kent WA (~30 miles). The device then suddenly is listed as Final Inspection on 9/30 Great! Im about to get my repaired DVD player! I arrive in the store on 10/3 to check on status and the Geek Squad agent asks me why I asked for it to be returned unrepaired. Say what? I state that I asked for no such thing that it should have been repaired. But there was no details as to why it was being returned, only that a member of Best Buy Bellevue had directed their service/repair team to return it. He promised to call me back when he got more details as none of the key players were around Saturday. (Never did get that phone call back Kevin!) I get an automated call Monday 10/5 stating that my DVD player is ready for me to pick up I call the store to confirm and get more details and the lady in the Geek Squad team spoke to me in an accusing tongue for doing something shady as far as I can tell the shady thing was buying an item off their sales table and returning the next day due to it not working. How that makes me shady I have no clue and I took great offense to that they were more than happy to sell the device and make their profit by selling the Geek Squad Black Tie coverage!  I drive to the store to pick up the DVD player and continue to feel in the wrong by their manner, I demand my device back first (To avoid being credited back without choice and losing my device) and then asked for a manager to discuss this failure but there were no managers around, I was told that the managers had discussed my purchase of this unit in detail and were refusing to repair the unit in fact they were guided to have me accept my money back for the device. This is not what I wanted I may have paid a lower price but I indeed bought this DVD player with all expectation that it would function there was no As Is notice on the device, it was sold as a product off their floor, and was sold with the Geek Squad protection. If these are unreasonable expectations the device should not have been sold at all.  Having no reasonable explanation of why the device was returned unrepaired, and no feedback from the Geek Squad agent about why they didnt just return it for Manufacture repair (no cost to BestBuy!) I spot the service location phone number on my service order. I call the repair center, give a quick recap about the device being returned and was told it was done because the Bellevue Best Buy did not produce proof/receipt of the sale to prove it was within warrantee period. When the service center asked for it, a manager type at Geek Squad saw the purchase price and denied the warrantee repair. It doesnt matter what price I pay it was sold and should be covered, Especially if the bill was on Samsungs plate!  Within 5 minutes of leaving the store, I get Samsung repair on the phone they authorize the repair; even without receipt the warrantee for the device was available until November (will extend to one full year once I fax my receipt). Thank you Samsung! Supporting a product that your retailer refuses to.  Today (10/6), after waiting for a few days for _anyone_ at Geek Squad to call and explain what failed in their support process, I call in and speak to a poor man in the middle; as no managers were available (again? Tuesday @ 3pm?!) he was able to at least get some information to me about why it was denied by their management its still unacceptable but heres their side of things The unit was purchased at too steep of discount, the salesman was not authorized to discount the price further by correcting the wrong remote at the time of sale (he was honoring the sale and pleasing the customer NOOOOOO!) The unit should have been replaced or refunded if returned within 30 days. Their service department (according to the sales managers) refuse to repair any device that should have been swapped out within that 30 days. The Management team balked at anyone footing the repair cost for this $25 device as basic repair would generally be many times the purchase price The Management thought that something shady was going on the sales price was too low and my actions of wanting a repair seemed suspicious (Agent corrected his words and suggested management thought the sales person did something shady, not the customer- Seriously? Then why not communicate ANYTHING to the customer yourself?) The Management really wanted me to return the item for the $25 + Geek Squad protection not accounting for the $40 for the remote already received from Samsung out of my pocket  So it appears to come down to The sales team failed by supporting a customers purchase by replacing the wrongly sold remote control. Sales team failed again by selling an item under cost (.??! Managers 50% off the last clearance price anyone?!) The Geek Squad team failed by accepting the device for repair even if considered a Manufacture repair within that first 30 days The Geek Squad Management team failed for not simply telling me, the customer that they can either refund the money or have me ship it directly to Samsung within the first 30 days  A lot of noise for a $25 DVD/Sound system (+GS Coverage+$40 remote total around $100 or just under 25% of retail) but if youre going to sell it and profit off the extended services, you should support it. If its not going to be covered as a working covered item then dont sell it, or put a As is sign on it. You couldnt sell it at full price, thats not my issue you sold it I bought it you support it.  Im told that my Geek Squad coverage is _NOW_ valid as Im 30 days past the sale (its been in their frigging hands for 30+ days!) The Geek Squad agent said that since the device is now out of the 30 day return policy that if any electronic component of the device fails that they will send it in for service, but if its not repairable then they will credit the PURCHASE price ($25) toward a new system not replace it with a like system. I read the Geek Squad coverage, this would be correct but anyone want to take any odds on them actually footing ANY repair bill for a $25 system that retails for $450+? I have a hunch that any attempt to get this device repaired after the manufacture warrantee period will be flat out denied regardless of the stated coverage that says the device will be repaired if the repair cost is less than the market price of the unit, if the repair is going to cost more than a refund/credit of up to the purchase price will be granted to the purchaser. (Repairs and price at Geeks Squads discretion)  There is no logical reason why it took Geek Squad 32 days to decide not to repair it and no reason for their management to hide and not just simply explain the reasoning granted I dont like their reasoning but they could have given me a workaround instead of the runaround. Stating I could ship it or return it would have been pretty simple, instead they choose to act like Im pulling a scam on them and avoid talking to me so with their behavior Im more than happy to share my experience to those that may consider their Black Tie service it failed for me, I believe its pretty well documented I   My timeline based on Geek Squads repair details (image below), there is no current ask of Geek Squad other than their assurance that the Black Tie coverage will be valid and not ignored in the event of failure 365+ days from the date of purchase.  9/2/09 Purchased Samsung HT-X710T DVD/Home Theater system 9/2/09 Returned to Best Buy the remote control sold with the unit was the incorrect unit, after spending 45 minutes helping Best Buy representatives search a drawer for the correct remote they decided to discount the device to reflect my costs in buying the remote direct from Samsung 9/3/09 Returned to Best Buy as the DVD player had problems playing DVD, screen had artifacting during playback 9/5 Unit was received by Geek Squad as a ship to repair 9/11 Unit was shipped to repair 9/18 Unit is in Repair 9/30 Unit is in Final Inspection, Awaiting Shipment 10/3 Unit received at local Best Buy 10/5 I picked up the DVD player 10/5 After walking out of the store, I call Samsun repair and schedule shipment of my DVD system for repair under warrantee  Peter of Issaquah, WA     10/8/09  My HP laptop that was purchased 6/10/09 started having malfunctions with InternetExplorer, and then it wouldn't do a system restore. I took it to the GeekSquad at BestBuy to do a warranty repair. I was told it was either a softwear issue, or bad hard drive, and that it needed to be shipped to the manufacturer for repair. After two weeks I get my laptop back to find out that they only blew the fan out. The employees there were too busy trying to flirt with me than to get the repair right. When I addressed this with the GeekSquad manager, I was told I should have read what was put down and that that was all they were going to do.   After getting my laptop home, I then find out that it is even more messed up than before. Now I have Error pop ups, and my mediaTV quit working. My husband and I then took it back to BestBuy to discuss their damaging my computer further. We were told that upon purchase of a laptop, you must pay an additional fee of over $100. for them to "peak" your computer. They said that HP is known for these problems with their softwear and computers not restoring.   So knowing this problem exists, you can not buy a computer and just take it home. If you do, then the GeekSquad requires you to pay $139 for them to look into repairing the restore issue. They told me that they can't send it back to the MFR for repair. Thus you do not get any warranty on your laptop through BestBuy. They tried to tell me the 14 day spill, but will not honor it since they had my laptop over two weeks to "blow out the fan"..My 1GB $350.00 GateWay runs better than this brand new 4GB HP from BestBuy. I have purchased 8 laptops from BestBuy and have never had such a problem with having them replaced when they went bad. But it seems that BestBuy has taken up the company policy to misslead it's consumers, while this location finds it ok to sexualy harass and discriminate it's women customers. Melissa of Sherman, TX     9/15/09  "If you have questions about your service experience, please contact the Geek Squad Precinct within your Best Buy Store" What a joke! I have an HP Touchsmart laptop that I bought in a best buy store in May 2009. I bought the Geek Squad warranty (3 years) with it for almost $300.00! August 27th it stoped working. The computer would turn on but not boot up.  I took it to best buy geek squad and spoke to "z" he stated that it could be the hard drive or the software. Z said I had to pay them 130.00 to run diagnostics and that would cover any repairs and that if it was the harddrive, that is covered under warranty so the 130 would be refunded back to me. Why do I even have to pay 130 or 99 for back up? I paid them 300 in the beginning for a warranty and I am being charged the same price for back up and repair as any yahoo that walks in without a warranty!  On August 31 I got a call from "Z" stating that it was the hard drive and that the 130 would be refunded, but because it's a problem with the hard drive, they will have to replace it and I will loose everything on my computer unless I pay them 99.00 to back up the files on my computer. I said okay and they stated it could take 3-4 weeks to fix (I go to college online.) On Sept 1 I got an e-mail stating the computer was being shipped to the service center for repair and if the agent needs adl't information, i will be contacted.  On Sept 4th I recieved a call from a women at the service center that said they replaced my harddrive and they have it in store that I need to bring my restore disc that came with the computer to the store so they can re-install everything (Question: I have been reading a lot of reviews about this and why is it that a huge COMPUTER REPAIR company within BEST BUY does not have the nesassary discs to complete the repair?) I said okay and I hadn't heard anything for a few days (now they have had my computer 1 and a half weeks, again ONLINE STUDENT)  So I called them today, Sept 9, 2009 and spoke with "Z" at the Garland store (VERY RUDE) could barly hear him on the phone and he said how can I help you what is your name make of computer when did you drop it off, what is your phone number (like he couldn't find it) and I told him that I had received a phone call stating it was back in Geek Squad's hands that i needed to bring the restore disc in the next few days because it was getting close to being done, and he said he had no idea what I was talking about, he said that the computer is at the service center waiting on additional parts, I said "when the lady called me she stated the harddrive had already been removed and a new one installed, what additional parts are needed?" and Z said "I don't know, it doesn't show us that".  you work there and you can't tell me what they are doing to my computer? and pretty much he said no, said he could esc the situation and he would MAYBE call me back in the next 2-3 days, but other than that he can't do anything. By this point I am noticiably angry and upset and being loud with him and I said "so you can't help me let me talk to your manager" he said no, I can't let you until you tell me why, why? Because I am angry with level of customer service and the level of customer service I have received from GEEK SQUAD!  Well, Z said his manager couldn't do anything for me either that I would just have to wait to find out what else needed to be fixed on my computer, I told him I didn't care, I wanted to speak to his manager right now, or I am going to sue, call the BBB, and the attny general to file a compliant, he still refused, and I told him you either transfer me to your manager, or we will both sit here in silance because I am not speaking with you any more, transfer me to a mangr! and he said fine, and put me on hold for 15 minutes b4 I finally hung up.  I called right back and asked to speak to the manager over of the geek squad and got the same run around, was placed back on hold for 20 mins and then the phone picked up, and hung up! What I am suppose to do? I need my computer to go to school and geek squad isn't telling me anything about anything! All I want is to know what is going on with my computer and they are doing that for me! Also, the Service Update Emails from Geek Squad are ridicoulus and lack any type of information!  Amanda of Wylie, TX     9/9/09  I purchased my Acer Extensa 4420 laptop during October 2008 and it broke in March 2009. I took it to the geeksquad in the Mira Mesa branch in San Diego as my laptop is still under waranty. The geeksquad agent requested me to go to the customer service department to print out my receipt. It took 3 hrs to find my receipt, as they finally found the receipt I noticed they printed out the wrong one because my laptop is a Black Acer and not a Silver Toshiba. After the I told the geek squad agent and he noticed the difference, he decided to look for the receipt himself and found it within 20 minutes.   I asked the Geek Squad Agent if my computer will arrive before 2 weeks because I will be moving back to walnut which is around 80 miles from san diego. He said the ETA will be 2 weeks from now which is 1 week before i move back to Walnut. After I moved back to walnut, my laptop is still under repair. During April 2009, my laptop has finally come back but they need the recovery disks and AC adapter for restoring the OS. I asked if they can mail me my laptop and I can pay for the shipping costs, but the representative told me they do not ship at all regardless if i pay or not. Then i asked if i can take my laptop to another closer location to restore my OS and they said that another location will not provide such a service because restoring the OS is a sort of service, and not a requirement.   So after finally findng the time to drive 80 miles (total 160 miles round trip) to get my laptop during May 2009, I brang in the required equipment (recovery disks and AC adapter) to restore my OS, they said that it will take 1 day to restore the OS. The next day, guess what happens? Geek squad calls to inform me that theres they'll need to replace the motherboard because they installed an incorrect one and they will need to send it back in for repair which will take another ETA 2 weeks.   Around mid June 2009 my laptop is back, and ready to pick up. I drive another 160 miles round trip to pick up my laptop. When I got home, its suprising that when I turned on the laptop the screen was black and said "no operating system" found? LOL? I just drove 320 miles and wasted 2 months of my time waiting for a laptop with no operating system. So after entering the system restore CD's I was forced to pay $20 for, the screen says "incorrect partition available." I didnt want to bring it back to Geeksquad as I was scared to go back, so after asking around I finally figured out how to restore my OS.   After 2 weeks with using my laptop, I realized that HEY my Acer Extensa 1.90GHZ, 2 GB RAM turned into an Acer Turion 1.80 GHZ, 1.80 GB RAM. So I took it back to Geek squad at the Rowland Heights branch immediately after I found out, I complained to the representative how it took months to fix and now they cheated me and downgraded my sytem without even telling me. The only thing the rep said was they dont understand how this could happen and this is a "RARE" case. So they took it in for repairs which is going to take about another ETA 2 weeks.   As I got my laptop in late July 2009, after using it for a day i noticed that the WEB/BLUETOOTH buttons doesnt move anymore. The next day I took it back in Geeksquad and the agent said that it must be the screws are too tight and they'll have to look into it, it'll take a day or so. The next day, it was so surprising that Geek squad called me and said that it can't be fixed in the store and they'll have to send it back in for repairs. The ETA is 2 weeks again. 2 weeks later, I get a call from the repair department saying that they are replacing my motherboard. I called back the repair department asking them why they are changing my motherboard when its only the buttons that dont work, the repair department representative department told me that the buttons are too loose on the motherboard and so the whole motherboard has to be repaired. Does that make sense?   One rep says the buttons screwed on too tight, the other rep says its too loose? Whose correct? So anyways, being helpless as I can, the rep said it'll take another few weeks because my motherboard is on order and after they get it they' will work on it from there. Yesterday, September 7, 2009 I get a call from bestbuy saying that my laptop has been junked WITHOUT MY CONSENT and that i am eligible for an exchange. So I went back in to best buy and was told that my laptop is only worth $299 and the cheapest laptop they have now thats compatible is $399.   I have to pay another $140 for a new laptop when I only used my Acer for 5 months, took 6 months to repair and they finally JUNK it without my consent. I asked if I can have my laptop back because it was working fine, the only problem is the buttons don't work. The representative told me that they couldn't do it because the repair department already junked my laptop. I either take the store credit $299 or pay $140 to get a new laptop. I feel that i haven't even used my laptop for 1 year, and is forced into buying another laptop from best buy. I took the store credit, but I never want to buy from best buy again.. DO NOT BUY FROM BEST BUY OR USE GEEK SQUAD!! Not to mention, Geeksquad never picks up their phones, 1/10 calls they will pick up or hang up your call.  Jenny of Walnut, CA     9/9/09  I was going to write a nice long story about my experience but after starting it i realized it would be to long. So here is the short version. Puerto Rico= NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. Virus Infected Laptop= Started at $150 to repair. Final Cost= $370! With NO choice but to pay or they keep the laptop. On going issues= Yes. Work was incomplete. Able to discuss issues with someone knowledgable= NO. Work remotely close to satisfactory= NO. Does anyone at GS/BB seem to give a [care] =NO Am I going to pay for shoddy service= Not a chance I will dispute it. Will I ever shop at or take my products to BB/GS for service= Never Again. On a side note, I am lodging a formal complaint to BB headquarters about the service I have recieved and seen in BB Puerto Rico. Never in my life have I seen so many people standing around talking or chatting on a cel phone while at work. Best Buy needs to be made aware of this and have something done. While I was waiting for my computer at one point I counted 9 people milling around doing absolutely nothing behind the customer service desk while all I had to do was turn my head to the left and see people looking around for someone to help them. Just seems wrong somehow.  Economic Damage= $370 for incomplete service, $20 in wasted gas driving back and forth, 6-8 hours wasted dealign with the situation. Undetermined amount of business damaged due to incomplete work. Brad of San Juan, PE     9/3/09  I took my computer into store 7/19/2009 for cd restoral settings, which would take 72 hours for repair. However it ended up taking them 3 weeks before I could pick it. I noticed video card had mild blurred lines when clerk first opened up at the store location. 4 days when I tested a musical cd the audio wasn't working. I then took it back to the store where I was told an audio/video replacement card was needed. However prior to the hard drive crashing these features were working.   8/25/09 I noticed that the computer had a gap on the front of shell, where it may have been opened or dropped. The condition of this laptop was not like that when I took for repairs. I went to the store manager (Rick) who stated that their policy is that if a computer is dropped then that employee would have to notify him. I am not satisfied with the managers response to damages on my lap top. Cost for restorl was approximately $139 and why wasn't the audio/video issue brought to my attention at the time I pickd it up. FRITZ of MADISON, MS     8/25/09  My liquid crystal TV started to messup and it took the geek squad four days to get to the service call even though the Best Buy is across the street. The tech shows up and tells me the TV is messed up and he will order a "board" and he will set up an appointment next week. My TV is still under warranty and my daughter was coming in from Denver and wanted to watch the Pats game with some of her friends----I called everyone trying to get my TV swapped out so I could watch the game at my house with my daughter and everyone a Best Buy said ---Sorry!!! Best Buys customer and warranty service stinks!!! Buyer Beware. Bob Bob of Nashua, NH     8/19/09  I had aproblem with my lap top computer. called the geek dept and was told to bring it in so they could take a look at it.I took it in and the geek that we talked to never even offered to look at it. Just advised us to buy a new computer. Just went on and on about how a 2 1/2 year old lap top was out dated. It would cost us at least 200.00 to fix and probably more like $400.00 or $500.00. I use it for our home use only.   Your wasting money paying a geek squad in Little Rock AR. We want ever go back to your customer service area either. They acted like they were very unhappy to wait on us for a credit card application. Hey, your paying them to run off customers . I will say that your sales people were very helpful and friendly. Just wanted you to know the geeks and customer service folks need a review. Norma of Paron, AR     8/19/09  I brought my 4 year old Apple to Best Buy Geek Squad due to sporadic shut downs. After reading information on the internet about similar problems, I informed the Geek Squad that I suspected a bad power supply. They informed me that they charged a $70 diagnostics fee. They also informed me that there would be a $100 charge to add 2 gigs of RAM about which I inquired. After three days, I got a call stating that the problem was in the Operating System and that a $130 services was needed to fix the problem. The 2 gigs of RAM were now going to cost $170, not the $100 originally quoted. Service to fix the problem was OK's, but addition of the RAM was not. I had just updated the OS several months before, and never had a problem, but they are the experts, right?   Several more days passed, calls were exchanged, and I was able to pick up the computer. After bringing it home, it shut off just as before. They said it was still under warranty for the services performed, and to return it. After several more days, I received a phone call stating that the problem was the power supply after all, a suspicion I reported when I brought there in the first place. I was informed by the Technician that the power supply was a "proprietary" item, to which they did not have access. "If you can bring us the part, we can put it in." Promises of obtaining the part number and returning phone calls were not kept.   I was informed by the Technician that my service charge (prepaid prior to work performed) would be refunded. I informed them that I would pick up my computer and wanted a full refund, including the diagnostics charge because they withheld information about not being able to fix a suspected problem in the first place. The supervisor stated that it is not their policy to refund and that all services were OK'd by me. They offered to find and install the part, which previously was unavailable.   By this time, Geek Squad had proven themselves to be non-trustworthy and inept, so further service was declined. The Geek Squad wasted 2 weeks of my time, performed unnecessary work, delayed repair of my computer, and they refused to refund any of my $212. I filed a complaint with their central public relations division, but they reported they could do nothing about securing a refund. They seemed genuinely disinterested that their employees provided misinformation, low-balled estimates, performed unnecessary services, failed to follow through on promises, and showed a pattern of general deception. Resolution will continue to be pursued. A. of Medina, OH     8/9/09  In November 2008, we purchased 4 laptops (2 Acers, 1 HP, 1 Sony), an IPOD 32GB Touch, HP CPU (with keyboard, mouse), and an HP 19" Monitor. We were offered an extended warranty at a considerable cost for each item but also assured that the various manufacturers' 1 year warranty would be more than sufficient as the extended warranty would begin after the manufactuers' warranty ended.  Two (1 Acer and the Sony) of the three laptops are completely useless (due to manuf. defects) or more than 50% useless. I returned them to the GEEKSQAUD for repair, as advised by BestBuy, paid $170.00 (85.00 each) as the required fee to have them sent off for warranty repair/inspection. That fee was non-refundable since both "estimates" for repairs were more than the original cost of the items when purchased. The third one (Acer) developed a virus (user error) and we were charged $219.00 by BestBuy/Geek Squad as their in-store fee for work related removal and clean-up on 7/29/09.  On 8/7/09, we were advised that there were additional problems that required sending it off for warranty/manu repair - we were told it would be a few more days and additional fees. The Ipod's glass face cracked in Mar/Apr and we were told that it had to be sent off to the only place making those repairs - BestBuy gave us the name, number and information required for that repair. That company has lost the Ipod and needs pertinent information regarding the purchase date/price/serial number to even locate our IPOD.  I contacted BestBuy only to find out they do not keep any records as to serial numbers, etc. for products sold and they couldn't help us at all ... however, they helped us replace the IPOD for my son by selling us a new one.  We've spent thousands of dollars and have little or nothing that is even usuable and we cannot seem to get any help from BestBuy except to be told we "should have purchased the extended warranty" several times when our electronics weren't fixable without spending more money. I am extremely upset, disappointed and want to know why they continue to get away with this blatant lack of customer service or respect for the consumer. Our losses total $9000.00 (purchase prices plus fees charged for different useless services that weren't provided) Wendy of Iola, TX     8/8/09  Nightmare began 12/20/2008, I made a christmas purchase in the amount of $284.82. One item I received was an Insignia Dvd Player which turned out to be defective and return it to Geek Squad. After much complaining on-line and many months on the phone as well as the local store, I've not received the monies I was promised. Lately, since May 30th and many errors later, I was promised in writing that a credit in the amount of $214.39 would be in the mail ASAP, instead I received $5.34.   Later, I was told that it would take 7-10 days. When that expired, again they tacked on another 7-10 days and so on and so on. I've spoken to Supervisors, Riverside Store Manager Gretchen, Geek Squad Manager Manuel etc. But to date I've received nothing after many promises. I'm tired of calling and calling and told a Supervisor will call back and no one ever does. I spent too much time and money and driven 600 miles to retrieve this item since this was a Christmas gift I purchased and had to go and get it back so that I can get it repaired, but it was never repaired and no effort to contact me was ever made.   After nearly eight months and many phone calls I finally got a so called credit, but I'm told I can't make a purchase unless it's in a gift card, but the problem is I have not received this card nor the money I was later promised instead of the gift card. I just tired of talking for hours at a time. I get transfered from one person to another and another and promises are made, I never hear back. Lucille of Corona, CA     7/22/09  Bought a Stereo that plays DVD's. I entered a feature that allowed the play to enable while driving. A feature that the manufacturer allows. So you can play it if you drive as its basically intended. Do you really think people would buy it to entertain their kids on long drives if you had to park? Geeksquad to wrongfully installed something, but then told me the warranty is void due to it allowed for play while driving. WHO CARES BEST BUY. Disable phones from TXT, cars from going over 65mph.  The problem they installed wrong was with the retracting antenna. They put in a DVD and checked if this feature was disabled purposely to void the warranty. I have it for my kids, I own a blue tooth and refuse to txt and drive, I don't drink and drive. AKA I am a responsible driver.  Pat of Fort Meade, ME     7/19/09  Computer Originally Purchased 12/22/08 Completed after-market installation of video card, extra memory, and power supply Jan 2009 May 20, 2009 computer dropped off at Best Buy for repair. Power in machine was consistently cutting off and would take 3 or 4 tries to re-boot.  June 4, 2009 notified that computer was available for pick-up but not repaired due to issue being caused by after market video card. Arrived at store with receipt indicating that video card was also covered. Exchanged video card and left machine in store. Tech in store replaced video card. June 5, 2009 Stopped at Best Buy to retrieve machine. Took unit home. Unit failed to boot at home same issue that originally sent the machine in for service. Returned unit to Best Buy. June 5, 2009 In store tech again replaced the video card after running some diagnostics, but was unable to repair the unit. Was informed that the unit would need to be sent out again. June 17-18, 2009 notified that unit was ready for pick-up. Arrived to pick up unit at which time I was told that the hard drive was replaced and was asked if I had brought the re-load CDs. No-one had told me to bring those CDs. I took the unit home to do the install myself. Upon getting the unit home removed the tape that had been placed on the 2nd (unused) drive bay door. Door would not stay shut it had been broken sometime during the repair process. Immediately called Best Buy and was told to bring the machine back in and that the repair to the computer drive bay would be expedited. Also took re-load CDs into store so that operating system could be re-loaded.   July 4, 2009 called Best Buy on way home from vacation. Was told that computer was NOT ready yet and was scheduled to be in on Monday July 6, 2009.  July 6, 2009 called Best Buy and was told that machine was NOT in and would not be in for another 5 or 6 days since it was being sent UPS and NOT expedited. Was also told that it may be in this afternoon, so will be stopping by to check on it. July 6, 2009 stopped at Best Buy on way home from work. Was informed that the unit was in. Tech went to get it at which time I informed them that they had my software and were supposed to re-load the OS. After about 20 minutes, he finally found the disks. Told me it would take 5-6 hours to re-install the OS. I informed them that I would be back the next day to pick up my machine.    July 7, 2009 Arrived at Best Buy 24 hours after last visit. After a long delay, I was finally informed that they were having issue loading the OS. Was finally told that it would probably have to go back to the repair center since they couldnt load it!!! Left store called and spoke to manager Mark Bass to express my dissatisfaction. Got the standard Im so sorry about this and call Corporate. Called 1-888-Best-Buy spoke to Geraldine. After a 50-minute phone call was told that I would be receiving a $50 gift card in the mail and that a request would be submitted for a machine replacement. This would take 3-5 business days.  July 10 Called Best-Buy for a status. Was told that it would actually take 5-7 business days so no news yet.  July 13 Called 1-888-Best-Buy. Person I spoke to was unable to find any information about my prior phone calls. Was informed that I would be getting a phone call from Geraldine within a hour. No phone call was ever received.  Other issue EVERYTIME I call the Geek Squad at the Glen Burnie, Maryland Best Buy, the phone rings endlessly and then someone picks up the phone, then immediately hangs up the line. This is VERY frustrating and happens at LEAST 3 times before I get through to a Geek Squad member.  I have now been without my computer for almost 8 full weeks.  Sherri of Pasadena, MD     7/15/09  Over the past several we have bought 3 computers, 2 microwaves, several phones, misc. videos, batteries. For my birthday Jerry surprised me with a digital camera on April 23, 2009. Today, July 03,2009 I went to take pictures and the battery was dead. We went to this store and ask for help. We needed not only a battery charger but the cables that were missing. After several people and numerous excuses we were told they WOULD NOT do anything for us, so we left with the camera NOT FIXED OR WORKING.   This did not set well as you can imagine, not only because of all the money we've spent in their store, but the way we were treated. We've had several experiences with computer problems, which they fixed after having to take it in many times, do to a different person telling us different problems. We are NOT pleased with their services and hopefully we'll find a better place to do business with. It's a shame they don't live up to the standards of the Best Buy name. We, thank goodness, have corrected the problem with the camera ourselves. Jerry/Janet of Washburn, IA     7/3/09  In March of this year I took my HP laptop to Best Buy because I could not get on the internet. All other systems on the system were working fine. The next day I got an email saying the hard drive was bad so I went back to the store. The young guy at the desk told me if I would bring them my receipt of purchase from Staples they could replace the hard drive under the manufactures warranty. I promptly took the receipt to the store. The next day I got an email telling me the computer was repaired and ready for pick up. I drove the 25 miles to the store only to be told that the email was in error and the computer was not ready. I was upset and told the agent as much and he was extremely rude and arrogant. He told me that I had not brought a receipt in and it was my fault. By this time I was getting a little upset and asked to speak to the manager. She determined that I had in fact brought the receipt in but they had not entered it into their system. She apologized and told me that she would make it right with a gift certificate or something (which they did not honor). The following day I went back to pick the computer up (5 trips, now) only to discover a large scratch across the cover. The same agent that was ugly to me before apologized and told me he'd like to give me a gift certificate for the damage. I refused, initially, but felt like $25.00 was a small fee for the damage so I accepted. Now, thirty-one (31) days later my laptop began blue screening so I took it back to Geek Squad since they had done the work. They looked it up and told me it was one (1) day past their warranty but if it was the hard drive again they would replace it at no charge. The agent even called the manager over and he said the same thing to my granddaughter and me. The next day I get a call saying the hard drive is bad and they will replace it but I need to bring in all discs that came with the computer. No disks come with this particular computer and they should have known how to restore it as it is customary with this particular model. I took the paper work I have back out to them and he again told me and my granddaughter they would replace the defective hard drive at no charge. The next day I get a call from the agent (Hello, this is agent?) and he informs me that I am several days out of their 30 day warranty and it will be $100.00 for them to replace the hard drive or I can order it directly from the manufacturer. I told him that he and his supervisor had told me twice previously that the hard drive would be replaced at no charge. He was rude and abrupt and told me he was trying to help me in a very condescending tone. I told him the manager said he'd honor the warranty since it was just one day over the 30 days but he told me he could not do that. I told him to leave it as is and I'd come to pick it up. If all this was not bad enough, I went just now to pick up my laptop and was told I needed to sign a piece of paper. When I read the paper it stated that I had been informed that my work was out of their warranty and the hard drive was not under warranty. I refused to sign the form and told them I would not sign anything stating that the hard drive was not under warranty when it was only 31 days old and had a one year warranty. The agent became angry and told me I could not take my laptop unless I signed the paper. I already had it in my hands so I proceeded out the door. He yelled at the security guy to stop me. I stopped once outside and explained the situation to the security guy.  The angry agent came out the door and told me he would not allow me to take my computer unless I signed the form. I finally told him it was my computer, I did not owe them anything and I was leaving. He yelled at the security guy and told him never to let me back in the store. I made a total of 8 trips (40 x 8) for a total of 320 miles and they did not repair my laptop. Being verball accosted in public was very humiliating. Diane of Hillsborough, NC     6/18/09  I purchased a mac book along with an additional damage protection that was good for a yr i had the laptop 8 months and it was dropped and the lcd screened cracked they took the laptop and dent it off 6 different times each time NOT fixing the unit now that they have had it for 6 months and it is out of the warranty they are not fixing the unit. Now they are saying that because it is out of the warranty that I have to pay to fix it. I have not taken the unit home at no point in the last 6 months and all they have done is put me off again and again till it was out of the warranty. Lisa of Phenix City, AL     6/11/09  My wife Terry took my computer to best buy (geek squad) to have it cleaned out, diagnosed and a new security program put in. I did this as my son just moved out and had used my computer for music... and wanted all of his stuff removed... When I got it back and tried to go online, I couldn't. I called the store and they said to bring it back, so I did. They redid the work and needed me to bring back the security program so they can reinstall it, so I did. I got it back and tried to go online again and couldn't. So I called geek squad and they said dial-up was not reinstalled as they use high speed internet at the store.  They said I needed to call my provider to get it back (why wasn't I told this the first time?). I called my provider and when talking to SBC to get back online, I realized a disk was left in the computer. It was a customizer 3.7.0 disk from geek squad was still in my computer. While getting online my computer screen went blue with white lettering superimposed on top of it self. SBC said since it was just worked on that I should shut it off and try it again and it should work like it's suppose to. But it went to the blue screen again. I called geek squad again and they said to bring it in. I left the laptop open to show them in writing (I also took a picture with my cell phone) but the laptop shut off before I got to the front of the line. They kept it and redid it again. Again I had to bring the security program back (had to drive back home to get). When I got the laptop back I tried to go online again and agian it went to blue screen.  I called the geek squad again and again they wanted me to bring it back, so I did (even brought the security program with me this time). I reminded them I only have dial-up. They told me again they only have high speed. I asked how they can see the problem if they don't have dial up (the speed I use at home). The guy behind the counter said he knows of one person that can hook it up to dial up (only 1 person and now they can hook it up to dial up????). I left the computer again and explained I was going to be in the hospital and was getting out on the 23rd of April and wanted it by the 24th. That would give them at least 5 days to fix it (when my computer had no problems but needed cleaning and a new security program...). On Monday April the 27th we had recieved no call from best buy so my wife goes in and talks to a JP. He tells my wife (after looking for the computer and only bringing up paper work without the computer) that it is "most likely" the motherboard going out (he said it must have been bad since we purchased it???) He said he is willing to give us the $120. for the clean out back. They will keep the $70. for the diagnostic check (???) and they will reinstall the new security program.  Why do I need a new security program on a laptop with a bad motherboard that doesn't work? My wife said she needed to talk with me about the problem and left (remind you they searched for my laptop, didn't bring it up with them and only brought the paper work). To us this was odd as the times that we have taken a computer to geek squad and when we would go for pick up they wouldn't just bring us paper work. The next day on Tuesday the 28th we called the store and spoke to Edwin (general manager) who said he had to speak with JP and would get back to us either later that evening or morning the next day, Wednesday. Well Wednesday the 29th comes and at 2pm after not receiving any call we called them and spoke to Brian. Brian said he would give us all of our money back and our non working computer (????). I speak to a Janelle (very nice) and told her my story. Janelle said that Edwin had started at noon and was in meetings since then. (????) She said that she would have Edwin call me after his meetings. Brian called me instead. Edwin had passed us to him. Brian gave me the same offer so I asked for the district managers phone number. Brian said there wasn't one. I would have to get it from the Best Buy consumer help peole at the 888 best buy number. I call it and spoke with a Frank and told him the situation. He put me on hold and tried to contact the manager at the store. After 16 minutes of being on hold he came back on the pone and said he couldn't get a hold of anyone. Then he said he would call me back later, probably the next day. I asked him for the district manager's number. Frank said that he didn't have it. I would have to get it from the store. I told him the store told me that I would have to get it from you and asked him to get it for me when he contacted the store. He said would not. He said it wasn't part of his job. Frank told me he had a supervisor that might have the number. I asked if I could talk to his supervisor to get the district manager's number. He said yes but as soon as I talk to his supervisor to get the district manager's number he would not be able to help me anymore. I asked him to get me his supervisor. Jesse, his supervisor got on the phone. He said he needed to call the store and put me on hold. He came back on the phone and with the same offer that the store had previously offered us. That is all he said he would do. I asked him why I would take a computer in to be cleaned out and be happy with my money back and a computer back that didn't work anymore??? Again he said that was ll he was willing to do. I asked for his supervisor and he said he has none. I said somebody has to write you a review. Then he said the only person I could write to that could change his offer was the CEO, Brian Dunn and gave me the address. I write Brian Dunn, sent it ups with tracking and yes he did receive it back in May of 2009. I gave Mr. Dunn all info pertaining to my complaints and also asked why didn't the diagnostics find anything wrong with my computer and does their deal sound like a good deal to him. Today is the 6th of June 2009 and still no word from Mr. Dunn and yes this Best Buy still hasn't presented me with my now not working computer. Yes Best Buy still has this computer so they say... All I want is for my computer to be returned in the working condition they received it in. But we know this is not going to happen. I need someone to help as Best Buy not even their CEO is contacting me to resolve this and in the fashion I requested them to do. Give me back my computer that is working like it was before they did what all they did to it.  Larry of Palmdale, CA     6/6/09  My boy friend bought me an Easy Share Kodak camera for Christmas (2008). I have only used it twice since I received it. It has been in a dry closet in a camera carrier and in the box it came in. My camera has not been exposed to any water, fluids ect. I took my camera out first part of May 2009 - and discovered that it does not work. I took it to Best Buy where my boyfriend bought it with the receipt. Geek Squad said they would send it in for repairs. 2 weeks later I recieved a call and was told it was not repairable.  I called Best Buy to find out more information. What they told me was liquid damage. I was stunned - how could that be when it has not been exposed to any liquids. At this point I feel I am SOL. I do believe and have heard other people say that this is a scam so they can get out of the warranty. I will never ever buy another Kodak product! My camera went in for repair May 3, 2009 and it is already June 4, 2009 and I still do not have my camera. So far my boy friend and myself are out of $189.00 - the cost of the camera. debra of Overland Park, KS     6/4/09  Had defective hard drive replaced on HP Computer under full manufactures warranty. Now Geek Squard is asking for a recovery disc. to reprogram the computer, I advised this computer did not come with a back up disc and that the recovery program is built into the hard drive and being that the hard drive was changed the recovery program is gone. Then told me it is my responsability to get a back up disc, so I had to purchase one at a cost of $16.00.  Now I get a call from there Kentucky Service center saying they want $249.00 to transfere my saved documents to the new hard drive. I complained so they gave me the # to there corp. office only to be told by "JASON" that they have no connection with the Geek Squad or there local stores and can't help me either. They said they will hold my old hard drive until 6/03/09 then is will be thrown out.  If it's under full manufactures warranty why shoud I have to pay for this service? This has been going on for 3 weeks and Best Buy refuse's to do anything for me, I just keep getting transfered from dept. to dept. and told by all that they can't help me. Please help me with this problem, Best Buy still not only has my computer but all my personal information. Louis of Seaford, NY     5/28/09  My 4-year old laptop was running very slow. I was advised by Geek Squad that I had numerous viruses which were slowing it down, and that they would fix the viruses for $199. But in order to fix the viruses, I would need to have my data backed up somehow, which I was not equipped to do myself. The higher point of service for data backup was an additional $159.  So with a total estimate of $359 to fix a 4-year old laptop, I asked the Geek Squad rep if it even made sense to fix this laptop, when brand new laptops were starting at $400 apiece. He suggested that yes, mine was a very nice laptop and worth spending the money to fix. He indicated that by cleaning up the viruses, my laptop would certainly speed up. While this seemed to be the case when I first picked up my laptop after service, it slowed down again after just a few days. When I brought the laptop back in, they ran additional diagnostics and then claimed that my laptop was running slow because I had too many desktop icons and not enough memory to support all the programs that I had. They suggested that I spend another $100 to purchase more RAM and have it installed by them.  When I approached the Best Buy manager about the situation, he compared it to having a car fixed, and that there might be more than one problem after the initial diagnosis. He was not going to refund my money, because the virus removal work and data backup was done.  I was not happy at this outcome. Having spent $360 to speed up my computer, it was still just a slow as before I brought it in. Fortunately, a friend of mine subsequently and correctly determined that I had too many programs loaded onto the computer, and that my virus software was also contributing to the slowdown. He removed 20 programs that I never knew I had, and downloaded new virus software for me. Instantly, my computer sped right up, and the problems were solved. I have since tried to reach the store manager at Best Buy several times, including through the mail.  Michael of Cardiff, CA     5/28/09  I can not get my tv set fixed after I bought a in house repair policy, For a month they have tried to fix it but always are sent the wrong parts so I have done with out a set for this long. coleman of haltom city, TX     5/6/09  In January 2009 I purchased a HP computer bundle from Best Buy. I paid for their 2nd level extended warranty and left my computer to be loaded and backed up on discs. In the beginning i noticed the computer moving very slow for a brand new computer with lots of memory. I called Best Buy and was told it had to be my server FIOS. Within a month it sporadically froze. This got more and more frequent.  In May i took it back to Best Buy as I had an extended warranty. I was told automatically that all my problems were because I had Limewire on my computer. I was very surprised to learn this since it was on my very old computer before this one with no problem. I was told that this was not a problem covered by my very expnsive warranty and was a soft ware problem. I had to pay to have all my files backed up and also pay to have the repair. Totaly over $250. They had the computer for almost a week.  When I got it home and the discs were loaded on, I noticed most of my photos and music was not on the computer, I again called Best Buy and was told to bring the discs back. When the discs were returned I was told that everything that wasn't there was corrupted . Why would I pay to have everything backed up and get nothing? I was never told this was even a possibility. I would have backed up my files myself for free. Now i have my very expensive HP computer minus music and minus photos and no limewire.  The very next day the computer freezes again. At this point I feel I should get a replacement computer. There was evidently something wrong with this computer from the start. Best Buys return policy makes no sense for the type of products they sell. I should not have to keep a faulty computer that I spent over $1000 for when it is determined to not be working properly before even 3 mos is up. I think the GEEK squad is a rip off and I was charged for absolutely nothing. Kim of Elmont, NY     5/6/09  I bought a plazma tv,receiver,small flat screen tv, lg.flat screen tv, 7 speakers for the receiver and paid for installation plus paid for extra on plazma tv to have them fine tune the tv. I paid over $6000.00 for all this. It has been a night mare. no one will listen when I called corp. offices or local store. They delivered the equipment what I could not carry. First appt. with the geek squad the guy did not know how to hook all the equipment. He left 2 times that day and came back doing out calls in between.I waited an extra week on the install to get a full day from them to get the install done in one day. I was told he would be back the next day 1:00pm, he called had to do another job, called at 5pm said he could come by in a hour. It was mothers day and we had plans. Scheduled for Wed that week (i took off work) he did not show. I could not reach anyone by phone.  They returned call 3 days later. Rescheduled again, Did not show, no call. I called left them my number, got a call 8 days later from them they came out SOMETIME THE NEXT week but unable to finish the install. Main TV and receiver still not working. I work alot of hours, had a death in family and was not able to pursue calling them every day, needless to say this went on 2 months they finanally showed up after I started calling them again everyday.  They came one evening on a work night and was here until after 12:am. I had gone to bed and they had to get me up to explain how the system basically work. They assured me they would come back and finish a couple of things and bring things they didn't have with them. I could never get them to finish the job, I called the manager and told him I was going to get an attorney if they didn't come back promptly. They were to call me that week ..no call.  Several months later I paid another local company around $450.00 to finish the job. ABsolutely a night mare! I WOULD NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN AND I TELL ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN. THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD. I had a quote it cost me over $1000.00 more, still don't know why manager was not reasonalable to talk, kept saying installer said nothing was wrong. They damaged my hardwood floors that I have to live with. Mary of Lexington, KY     4/28/09  I contacted Best Buy customer service on March 18, 2009 to report a problem with the Panasonic Plasma TV I purchased on January 17, 2008. A Geek Squad technician was dispatched to diagnose the problem on March 21st. After a diagnosis, he determined that a major component had to be ordered and replaced. After two weeks and many failed inquiries on the status of the ordered part, the technician returned on April 3rd. He then informed me that another large component had to be replaced and that the repair can only be done at the service center. He also told me that someone from Best Buy will contact me to pick up the TV. More than two weeks passed since he told me that Best Buy will contact me. My wait continues.  In the mean time, Ive contacted customer service numerous times and spoken to two different supervisors and a few Geek Squad agents. One of the supervisors agreed to submit a replacement request and assured me that I will be contacted with the decision. I am still waiting. Soon itll be a month since I first contacted Best Buy with this problem and more than a month without a working TV. During this ordeal, while dealing with customer service, Ive spent a lot of time being on hold and explaining my problem to every agent that was connected to me.  Furthermore, because of the distance from work to home, I was forced to take a couple of hours from work to meet the technician on April 3rd. This episode has also cost me two months of subscription fees to Netflix and DirecTV. I wouldve suspended both the accounts had I had known the repair would take this long. Everytime I talked to a Best Buy agent, after apologizing profusely, he/she assured me it will be repaired very soon.  In April 2008, the FCC fined Best Buy $280,000 for failing to alert customers about the digital conversion (Los Angeles Times, April 11, 2008.) In March 2009, a class action suit was filed against Best Buy in U.S. District Court for allegedly violating its Price Match policy in NY State. Two former Best Buy employees claimed the retailer had an undisclosed Anti-Price Matching Policy and encouraged employees in part through training and financial bonuses to deny price match requests (HD Guru 3/21/09). It is evident that Best Buy engages in unfair and unethical practices. I believe theyve deployed delay tactics on me hoping to avoid repair/replacement costs. Decide for yourself whether you want to patronize a company like this.  Rad of Chicago, IL     4/17/09  Jan 2009 Geek Squad said that the desktop HP would not start due to software issues, $200 to perform diagnostics and fix. Worked only if you never turned it off. Returned to store in March and diagnosis was now the Motherboard. Received back today and it will not even turn on at home although we tested it in the store and it did work. Now we are told to bring back along with all peripheral equip, monitor, keyboard and mouse.  Second issue is the AAA 20% off Coupon for REPAIRS, brought into the store, was not honored for the Motherboard repair. Nicole is stating that this is due to the fact that it is a part which is not sold in the local store and therefore cannot be discounted. It sounds like the consumers are being held accountable for third party vendor contract arrangements. Right now I am out $350 and still do not have a functioning computer. Trisha of Eden Prairie, MN     4/14/09  I ordered my lap top through their online store. Did a huge amount of research on what I wanted to get. The girl on the phone (I called in to place my order) gave me the warranty for 1 year no accidental. When the lap top arrived I went into Best Buy and was smart enough to ask about the warranty and found that I did not get what she stated I would have. Cost me an addtl $200 out of pocket to fix.  I purchased the Dell XPS16 and have had issues from the first week I got it. The system crashed the first week, which I was able to get back up, only to have all my songs gone and my vpn hookup. Was a miracle, really didn't have to do anything, except to keep trying. Seemed to be working ok until yesterday when I was checking a disk I burned to see what was on it and my dvd/cd blue ray disk froze. Wasn't able to close anything down even with shift control esc. Resulted in having to close the power button down. Turned it back on, restart using normal system. Got the initial log in screen back, was able to log in only to get no response except welcome. Welcome to what, the system never came back up again.  I spent over $2000 after adding a number of things, warranty, etc. Now my lap top has been sent out and I am again without a lap top (I used for work business) for 10 days. No replacements were offered or available. They even wanted to charge me $100 to save what I did have on the computer. I work from home periodically, (commissions analyst for a stock firm)through vpn. I also have a side business doing weddings. All my data will be gone (thank goodness I didn't have the lap top long). It frustates you that you spend good money and get lemons in return. Kim of Redwood City, CA     4/13/09  On April 1, 2008, I bought a Gateway laptop from a Best Buy near my home town. I happy with the computer until I went away to college. About 2 months after being in college the power cord broke and I had to take the computer back to the store I bought it from when I went home for a weekend. It took 2 weeks for the laptop to get mailed to the dorm rooms where I go to school. The computer was fine for about 3 more months.  However, on February 27th, the computer stopped charging all together even with the replacement power cord. I had to drive 30 minutes to the nearest Best Buy location in order to have something done with the laptop. They told me at the Geek Squad, after about a half of an hour of staring at the laptop and fumbling through different ac adapters, that the laptop's power supply intake was broken. They then took my laptop and told me that they had to send it into repair, of which they did not tell me how long it will be at the shop. I am a college student who it is very inconvenient to have no computer to do work on, and most of my classes require some work on the computer. It is now March 30th and the computer is still not back at the store or in my possession.  I called the store today in order to find out where my computer was and they had no idea. After a frustrating 2 hours of them searching, a member of the Geek Squad returned a call and stated that We do not have your computer here, however it is still at the shop. We recieved your computer on February 27th and it is still there. I asked how long it was going to be there, because it's rediculous to have to wait for a computer to get repaired, which only takes 3 days. He told me that, Looking at your case it will take another week, 2-3 days for repair and another 4 for transport. 4 Days for transport!  I was shocked because they have had my computer for about a month and they still have not done ANYTHING to help. I can see if it took 2 weeks for the entire process but it has been a month with no, ABSOLUTLY NO, word from them.  Sean of Larksville, PA     3/30/09  A Geek Squad technician was here to finish follow up work on my television. A tune up and changing out a panel were the only things to take place. The television was working prior to the technician, some sort of issue came about and the technician said the TV malfunctioned. Daniel stated someone would call me with a claim number so I could would be replaced by another television. I haven't received a phone call. Instead, I am calling the 888 number and no one seems to know what I am talking about. One lady (Melvena) in the Geek Squad dept stated it would take 2 days. However, Daniel made it seem like someone will call me today. April of San Diego, CA     3/24/09  In January 2009, I took my Dell computer in to be tweeked. The computer was 5 years old and I had some very important information on it. My family pictures, legal documents, addresses, etc. were stored on that computer. When I returned to pick up the computer, I was informed that the computer was infected and they would need the restore disk to set up my computer. I told them to forget it and I wanted to get my computer and back-up that they had done when they were cleaning up the computer. I had to end up having them send them to me as they had not made the disks yet. I had to have another computer repairman finish the work that they should done. He informed me that they had damaged the boot drive and tried to restore it themselves. In addition, they did not back-up the program files so now all my data files are no good. Some were purchased online and now I will to repurchase them. I called the store and was informed that they do not back up the program files, which I was not aware of. My advise is never and I repeat never take anything to the Geek Squad for repair. Joann of Saint George Island, FL     3/22/09  We had a issue with Best Buy # 1499 [Tulsa, OK] because they did not secure our car & they refuse to cover damage because their employee did not take items or fill out paper work completely which is false. Our Complaint Description was: Store install of radio caused electronic climate control below radio to start blinking lights off & on, damaged front right head light cover-crack plastic. Did not secure vehicle when they put car in their parking lot. Vintage 1988 Mark Vll has missing items, but we don't claim store took items. We do claim lost because car was not secured when they put it into their parking lot under their care.  They had a duty to secure car left in their care because any reasonable person should of foreseen a problem if vehicle was not secured. Their paper work is incomplete, so I do not know names of installers, serial number, but items are checked off in good shape before they worked on car that were damage while in their care. We repeat, we did not think installer took items, but car was left vulnerable with unlocked doors etc.  Desired Resolution: Replacement of damaged and stolen items from car & repair / refund of unused wrong parts they sold us. Use of new electrical harness vs them using old harness left behind after Alpine stereo theft. Is this a department of Insurance issue? Michael of Henryetta, OK     3/19/09  I purchased a Whirlpool Washer & Dryer 4 years ago from Best Buy in Brandon FL. After being strongly advised to purchase the extended warranty I complied. I purchased a 5 year warranty that expires in the fall of 2009. In all fairness, I have used the extended warranty once before 2/11/09 with great success. This now appears to have been a fluke as I have been waiting since 2/11/09 for a part/parts to repair my dryer and everytime I call the Geeksquad/Bestbuy, I end up with the same response. 1) Someone will call me back with a status in 3-5 business days. 2)Someone is going to research why the service repair person hasn't returned any calls with the status of the parts ordered. 3)I will be submitted for a replacement because they can't reach the Service Repair contractor and can't locate the parts. 4)Then I'm told my request for replacement was denied because I've had the dryer for more than 30 days and their policy is to have the unit repaired and if that doesn't work they will resubmit another request for a replacement. I didn't even know I was eligible for a replacement until the Customer Service Rep mentioned it to me and that he didn't see why there would be a problem. Again, I'm told to wait 3-5 business days. I have been told by numerous supervisors that I would receive a return call from them by close of business. This is clearly a trained response and one that is never actually carried out! There is clearly a disconnect with Best Buy/Geeksquad & their local service contractors regarding customer service. I welcome any attorney that wants to contact me regarding a class action suit and will be more than happy to join any existing class action suits. I know my taking my business else where clearly won't affect Best Buys bottom line but I refuse to sit here and take whatever they decide to dish out. So now after six weeks, I end up being instructed to wait 2-3 additional business days for parts that may or may not have been ordered.  As late as 3/16/09 I was told by CSR Amanda and her Supervisor Terri, that the Supervisor, Terri would research the problem and submit for replacement. I would receive a call by close of business. Guess you know by now I didn't receive a call. I call again on 3/16/09 around 4:30pm as this has been a whole day and no return call even though they have more than one number on file, that I update EVERYTIME I have called regarding this problem. So I call again 3/18/09 and now I'm told I was denied a replacement and that the parts somehow magically were sent out overnight on 3/16/09 to the local service technician Mel's appliance and that the supervisor would...you guessed it call me back by the end of the day. I don't find this remotely funny entertaining etc., Mel's appliance doesn't return my calls so I have ceased to call them and apparently they don't answer Best Buys calls because no one has been able to reach them.  Around the 3 week mark, I even requested to have a new local company come and service my dryer and was told that would not be in my best interest because I would have to wait 3-5 business days before another company would be able to contact to set an appointment to troubleshoot and then order another part. I clearly, calmly explained all of this to Ashley who is the Manager for Supervisor Trisha. I asked for Trisha's last name and was told it's against company policy. I asked for an employee number to accompany the first name only that I was given and was told Ashley (employee #152912)couldn't give me that either but she could provide hers and the address to file a formal complaint.  My next recourse is to write a formal complaint to as many corporate officers at Best Buy I can locate, the BBB and any local media. I will picket the Best Buy in Brandon FL. I'm sure this will only result in me being arrested, but hopefully it will bring enough media attention to the poor customer service and extended warranty service Best Buy continues to force feed its customers. Any help that can be provided is greatly appreciated. Thank you, Karl of Riverview, FL     3/18/09  I am very unhappy with my service with Best Buy. I purchased an Insignia LCD HD TV in April 2007. Model 32 LCD-NS (discontinued model). I called for service, and it took 18 days for someone to come out to look at it. (that was the 1st appt available, fortunately I was available!) On Feb 28, The technician was here for a whole 4-6 mins, and informed me that he had to order a part, and that I would receive a call within 3 days. (I had been without a TV for 3 weeks) I didnt receive a call, but I received a email statement (bill) in an amt that exceeds the amt I paid for the TV.  On March 2, I sent an email to customer service and never received a reply. After multiple calls to customer service, I was connected to the consumer relations department., March 5. I spoke with Billy, and he said that this was wrong, and that he would get me a voucher for a new TV within the next 3 days. He apologized, and said that this should NOT have been overlooked by the Geek Squad, and that he (Billy) would fix the matter. He got a geek squad manager on the phone , Gary, to apologize. Again , they said that I would receive a call within 3 days to get a voucher for a new TV.  I DID receive a voice message 4 days later, that said that the request that I submitted that the unavailable part request was denied, and that I would have to wait for the part. I did not apply for an unavailable part request.' I applied to have a new TV because the amount they are charging to fix the TV exceeds the amount I paid for the TV. I still do not have anyone to help me. I have made at least 9 calls, and the only person who remotely acted in my behalf was Billy. However, his actions did not do ANYTHING for me.  I have now been without a TV for weeks. And no one is helping me. When I call the store, they say that they cannot help me and that I have to deal with 1-888. It is March 11, and STILL NO CALL. I paid a lot of money for this TV, and a lot for the warranty. I haven't had it for 2 years yet. It stopped working at the beginning of February, and as of yet have not had anyone fix or replace it. It is hard to be without a TV. I am ill, and I use my TV a lot. Rosalie of Akron, OH     3/11/09  I bought a laptop computer/DV9408NR/TURION TL-MODEL:GA356UA with a 17screen on 09/02/07 from the BEST BUY STORE.With the installation of some softwares like spy sweeper GS PRECINCT,TREND MICRO AV ,the price was $839.54.(this was a $200 instant rebate price).This computer I bought for my son who is in college.On 12/26/2008 I gave this computer to the above Best Buy store to fix some problems like screen flickering,wireless switch does not work,overheats,battery last less than an hour etc.After 2 weeks they contacted us saying $700 some to fix the problem and I declined it as the price seemed too high. On January 21 they called to pick up the computer and when I went there they told me that they lost the computer.We told them that we couldn't lose it because so many important files and documents in it.They offered $300 gift certificate or $400 off on computer purchace.We want a fair settlement like a new computer with equal or more memmory and technology,more functions etc. my son could not do his home works on time because he did not have a personal computer with him.He lost so many important files he needed for future use. Thomas of Des Plaines, IL     3/10/09  The MPs player (Insignia) I purchased developed a malfunctioning tuning wheel within a year. I called the repair number and was told they would issue a shipping label and I should return the player for a replacement which they would send within two weeks. The label arrived promptly and I returned the player on January 5, 2009. I noted that UPS had delivered the player to Best Buy/Deal Tree a day later. One month after that I called to ask why I had not received my replacement. I was told the player had arrived, that it was in the warehouse, and they would elevate its status to get it out.  A month later I received a player with a new set of earbuds and computer connection. Only problem was it was the same MP3 player I'd sent them and it worked no better than it did before, still broken. I emailed and got a reply that if I had any questions I should call the number I originally called. I emailed back that for a $59 product I'd already spent too much time and they could forget it. I also told them we'd bought numerous appliances and electronics from Best Buy but they'd lost a customer. Worse service I've ever known with any company. Much time on the phone getting nowhere. Still have the same defective problem I had before. Jh of Arlington, TX     3/6/09  I purchased an acer extensa laptop dec 29 2008. Within 2 months the laptop started timing out on websites and one night after putting it down and coming back to the laptop I noticed what looked like a feather line and then plaid colors all over the monitor. I took it back to Best Buy to the Geek Squad counter and opened up the laptop. The salesman Victor told me there was a crack in the monitor. However, I could not see or feel any crack. He said it was my doing. I told him he was wrong; the problem with the monitor is internal. I told him to send it back to Acer to have it repaird and he rudely told me that it was not worth it because people replace laptops every three months! I then had him show me some other laptops and he tried to talk me into a extended warranty with the new laptop. I asked him why I would buy a warranty if like he said people replace laptops every three months and he just smiled. He went back to the counter to write up the slip to send the laptop back to Acer and he then came back and told me Best Buy could not send it because it was under warranty.  So, now I'm confused. [They] wouldn't fix it because It's not under warranty, yet Best Buy would not sent it back for me because it's under warranty. Bottom Line: Best Buy sold me a computer for $500 and now will not stand behind their products or help out their customer by attempting to resolve the issue, fix the computer, or since the computer was less than 60 days old and was not abused, would not offer even a discount on a new computer. That is bad customer service and bad business - especially in this type of economy.  I am out %500.00 for a brand new computer. I have looked into getting the computer repaired and the cost is over %200. That is $700 for a lemon laptop! Kimberly of East Rockaway, NY     3/6/09  I have been a faithful Best Buy customer since you opened. I have spent thousands of dollars over the years and brought several items in for repairs. I have bought several big ticket? items, dishwasher, washer and dryer, cameras & computers along with the extended service plans. I have never had a problem with one of your stores until now. I brought my computer to the Best Buy store in Simi Valley, California on 1-28-09 for repair because it failed to boot and I suspected it needed a new hard drive. I also requested to have the CF card slot replaced since it didnt work anymore. I dropped it off at lunch time and Victor from the Geek Squad told me it would be done in 1 week to 1 weeks. I noticed on the paperwork that it was scheduled to be done by 2-14-09 but figured it couldnt possibly take that long since it takes less than 1 hour to install a new hard drive.  I received a call from the service center on 2-4-09 that they had received my computer and it needed a new hard drive. I asked where they were located since I wondered why it took 1 week from when I dropped the computer off for them to call me. The woman who called told me they were located in Chino, California. I asked why it took so long for my computer to get to the repair site but she did not know. I told her they could have shipped it to India faster.  I stopped in the store on 2-13-09 and was told by Victor that my computer was almost ready. It was still at the service center but should be shipped back on Monday by the latest and that he would put a Rush? order in on it.  I called the store on 2-16-09. After several attempts to get someone in the Geek Squad to answer the phone I got frustrated and called back asking to speak to a supervisor. I spoke to Lamont. I asked why no one ever answers the phone at the Geek Squad. He said that they have had some budget cuts so the Geek Squad is very busy. I told him that was no excuse for bad service. He checked the status of my computer and said that the service center was done with it and they should be shipping it back to the store that week. I told him that last week I had spoken to Victor who said that it was almost ready. He said that was not correct because they were still waiting for parts last week. I told him that my patience was running out with them considering that they had my computer for 2 weeks and something needed to be done to get it back. I said that if this were his computer Im sure he would not be very happy about this. He said that he would mark the order as Rush? and it should be in by the end of the week.  I received a call from Best Buys computer system on 2-18-09 at 6:30 p.m. stating that my computer was ready and I had 5 days to pick it up. I was thrilled even though that meant it was exactly 3 weeks from the date that I dropped it off for repair.  I went to the store on 2-19-09 and saw my computer behind the counter. A Geek Squad member came to the counter. I told her that I was here to pick up my computer. She said that it wasnt ready yet. I said that it was right there under the counter and that the Best Buy computer had called me last night saying it was ready and to come and pick it up. She said that the computer calls when the item is received back to the store. I said, Why did it tell me to pick it up and it was ready.? She said that she didnt know but it was not ready because they still needed to install drivers on it. I asked her how long this would take since it has now been over 3 weeks since I dropped off my computer. She said that it should be done by tomorrow, 2-20-09.  I called the store at 3:30 p.m. on 2-20-09 and was told by Jeff in the Geek Squad that it was done. I said, It is completely done and I can pick it up?? He said, It was just about done and it would be ready by the time I got there. I went to the store at a little after 4:00 p.m. Victor was very rude to me when he saw me. I said that I was there to pick up my computer. He went back to the back of the Geek Squad and brought it to me. He then wanted me to sign a paper stating that I Christy, recognize that repairs have been performed in a manner that is satisfactory to me? before he would give me the computer. Why wouldnt this form just state that the item was received? How would I know that the repairs have been done satisfactory to me without turning on the computer myself which I wouldnt be able to do until I got home? I signed the paper but told Victor that I wanted a copy of what I had signed. He was really put out by this. The girl who had been working the day before showed up and told him all he had to do was make a copy of the paper. He made a copy and handed it to me without even saving anything. I said, Youre welcome.?  I got the computer home and found out that they did not actually replace the media reader even though it states that they did. If they did, it still doesnt work. Considering that it took over 3 weeks to get my computer back there is no way I will bring it back in for the media reader. I tried to call the store several times to see what to do about the media reader but no one answered the phone in the Geek Squad. Big Surprise!!! I also noticed that they did not properly partition the drive since it should always have a recovery? section.   The service I received is very disappointing to say the least. It is ridiculous that it took over 3 weeks to install a new hard drive. It isnt like they had to get the old data off. All they had to do is stick a new drive in. There is no excuse as to why it took so long.  I am sure now that Circuit City is out of the picture Best Buy thinks it has no competition but that is not the case. Frys Electronics, Costco, Staples and others all sell computers and offer repair services. Poor customer service is one of the factors that led to Circuit Citys ultimate demise.  I still have one more year on my extended service with Best Buy. Hopefully my computer keeps working because I do not want to deal with the morons working there ever again. I would rather pay someone who is competent to fix it and have it back in a reasonable amount of time. I am going to spread the word to stay clear from Best Buy and the Geek Squad. No one else should have to experience the horrible service that I received.  Christy of Fillmore, CA     2/23/09  As much I have with this new Tosiba and reading all your complaints, it's not worth the trouble writing my complaint down. As a was loyal customer for years as well as my whole family we've been, I feel that best buy has let me and my family down alot. That's alright as there are other company's been wanting our business and more than likely will get it and that's [due] to Best Buy so called professional people working at stores. AGGRAVATION Poncho of Port Isabel, TX     2/23/09  Our Frigidaire, Model #FRS3R5EMBO was purchased in August 2005 according to Best Buy, firmly believe it was several months after this date. The freezer stopped working in Nov. 08, we called to get repair under the extended service plan that we paid additional for. We had to wait a WEEK before the service tech was available to come out for service, by the time he arrive the freezer started to work again. Unfortunatley the service tech was unable to determine what was wrong and left w/o any repair or insight as to what was wrong. After this time, the freezer stopped on 2 diff occasions but started working right away and no groceries were lost (We did NOT place call to Best Buy/ Geek Squad for these 2 times).   Then again in Jan 08 I woke up to another puddle on the kitchen floor and a whole freezer of groceries lost, called to place another service was advised they had no record of the last call but would have someone come out, the soonest was another week wait time. Of course as I suspected would happen, it started to work by the time the service tech came out. The tech still unsure what was wrong assumed it might be the thermostat as both the frige and freezer are set at the highest possible settings of 6 and should not need to be set this high according to the tech.   We were advised that we would need to empty out all of the frige and freezer before this part could be installed. Well since it appeared to be in working order and not having a place to store the groceries I asked that the installation be held off. Well, the freezer has stopped working AGAIN (now for the 5th time), I called to schedule and was advised that someone will be calling me within 24-48 hours to schedule, this could be as late as Monday. I have since called several times and have been given the run-around on the automated system only to be disconnected after holding for long periods. This warranty is going to be up the end of the year and I am fearful we are going to be stuck with an appliance that we are going to have to replace after a couple of years.  Jessica of Seminole, FL     2/19/09  Our 56 inch Samsung TV stopped working on Dec. 24, 2008. We received an appt for Jan. 3, 2009. The tech came on Saturday, January 24 (the part came in and the TV still does not work). Now they ordered 2 more parts and one part came in (Feb. 11) but the 2nd part is not due until March 21! I called to request a loaner TV, they said they can't do that. I asked for an extension on my warranty since my TV hasnt worked in 56 days (and counting), they said they cannot extend the warranty.  I then asked what CAN they do for me, and she said Nothing, just wait for the part. I paid for an additional 4-year warranty and they are unwilling to help me, all I want is for a TV for my living room to work. I paid over $3,000 for a HDTV that hasn't worked in over 56 days and counting...all I want is for them to provide customer service assistance and a working large screen HD television set. Andromeda of Ridgefield Park, NJ     2/18/09  When I bought the HP Pavilion Tablet PC, one of the two big selling points was the swivel top and the Tablet component which allowed the translation of written text on a touch screen with a stylus. After having the computer for a few months and not being able to configure the Touch screen, I went to best buy and asked for help wherein, I was informed that while my computer had the capacity for the touch screen, it lacked the hardware (i.e. not the right SCREEN nor the stylus, nor the software). So in essence, it does not have the capacity at all. This model theoretically has the capacity, it says so on line, but apparently, the actual generation my particular model is, does not.  Best Buy then, offered to sell me an exterior component--a Tablet PC add on that would allow me the use of this option on my computer. I refused, furious at being lied to. Now, the computer is not working, due to a defect that has arisen in the same family of computers mine is from. Again, Best Buy refuses to deal with the issues despite my independent research online proves they are aware of the issue. They are shady. I still am paying by credit for the computer, which now does not work after less than two years. What can I do? A great deal of wasted time and effort and stress as I use this notebook for my livelihood. I am homeless, and financially strapped, so I need access to online resources to get on my feet. I have nothing now. This computer and my car are the only things in my life worth more than twenty dollars. I am sick to think that I will have to pay for two more years on something the people who sold it to me, knew was defective. My stomach hurts. Jennifer of Austin, TX     2/16/09  took the tower to best buy to do a back up, and brought home system failure, took tower back. the hard drive was unplug. took home again and vista windows were gone. left at best buy on 2/3/09 and left several messages and no call back. its going 13 days, call Best Corp to file complaint. still no calls and they have mine tower. Renee of Burbank, CA     2/12/09  In late November of 2008 I purchased some electronic devices from Best Buy. I also opened an account in the store and charged purchases to the account. I set up a delivery date for Dec 8th for 2 TVs and installation by the geek squad on the 9th. (I took off both days from my job)I was charged for the delivery of 2 TVs and only one was delivered. On the 8th of Dec only one TV was delivered. When I called the store I was told to come in and pick up the other so that it would be available for installation the next day. I drove to the store at 8pm to pick up the TV. The next day no one called or came for the installation.   I returned to the store to have the charges for installation removed from my bill. However I have never been reimbursed for having to drive back into the store to get the other TV. (At least for half of my delivery fee as the product was not delivered)As I looked forward to getting my bill and paying it off and having nothing more ever to do with BEST BUY I never received a card or bill till approximately Jan 10th. The first mail I got was a BILL NOT CARD and it showed a late charge assessment, dispute release, and amount in dispute etc. I knew since I hadnt had any contact with them since my purchase something was wrong.   It turns out that my purchases had been put on my sisters account she happens to have the same last name and she had called in to dispute the charges. Once I found out that this company cannot keep accurate records I decided to close the account because I knew that future purchases would result in a similar problem. Now I called and spoke to a supervisor who told me to pay the balance of 3477.00 to close down the account. I sent that out immediately. My bank records show that the check cleared on the 26th of Jan. I kept calling to get a letter stating that the account had been closed. First I was told when I called account balance that my check had not been received. So I immediately called my bank to get records. Then I was told I had two different accounts. I finally spoke to a supervisor Jennifer ID JCF who figured out that the check was used to credit one account and the other had a balance with the same amount so some how I had two accounts in the same name. She recently told me to expect a letter stating that those two accounts have been closed down in 7-10 days. I would like other consumers to note the following:  1) Best Buy is highly unprofessional and cannot keep accurate records within the store of purchases made by an individual. This could endanger a persons credit rating if not closely monitored. 2) Employees at the Best Buy store at Mt Vernon, NY knowing lie to customers about delivery and installation dates. (GEEK SQUAD).   It used to be the case that those businesses who said they could provide a service charged and delivered on that service. Now consumers shell out tons of money to make purchases and get the worst experience ever. Some action needs to be put in place when these types of businesses cannot deliver and decided to give you the run around?  In closing I need to state I will NEVER be making a purchase at any BEST BUY store ever and I intend to share my experiences at BEST BUY to discourage sales to and victimization of other potential customers. It turns our BEST BUY should indeed rename it self WORST BUY! Nse of Bronx, NY     2/7/09  We purchased a DVD recorder in OCTOBER 2008 and have yet to be able to use it! It has been to the GEEK squad for repair, I believe this is the 5th time! And they apparently have put over $1,000.00 worth of parts in a $200.00 recorder...who does that? We still do not have the recorder and they refuse to replace it. They just want to fix it...which they can't seem to do either!  We purchased the dvd recorder only to send it for repair this is the 5th time and have not been able to use it! We will NEVER do business with Best Buy again and as for their GEEK squad, they couldn't get themselves out of a paper bag if that's the intelligence of someone who cannot FIX a BRAND NEW device. I will also never buy LG again! Teresa of Eugene, OR     2/5/09  Service for the Geek Squad is simply terrible--DO NOT buy a service contract from Best Buy. I placed a service call 7 days ago for my 46 television. At that time the lady in customer service stated that I needed and new lamp...so she set up and appt for service (one week from the call (that was as soon as I could get). The service tech show up and says you need a lamp and I dont have one we will have to order it it'll take 7-9 days to get one (even after the rep told me i need one 7 days ago). Then the service rep explains as soon as you receive the lamp give us a call and schedule an appt for service to replace which may take another 7 days. Three weeks -no super bowl-for a lamp to be replaced in my television. The thing that bothers me most is the 16 year old who sold me the contract said we generally service with 2-3 days....Best Buy we deserve better and I will never purchase from you again.  Tom of Cleveland, OH     1/27/09  My 5-month old HP laptop ceased functioning so I returned it to the Middletown, RI Best Buy. I was told by the Geek Squad that it had a bad motherboard and had to be mailed back to HP for repair as part of the manufacturer warranty. I was called a week later by the Middletown Best Buy Geeks and told that they found the problem and had a quote for how much it would cost to repair. I told the Geek that it was under warranty and was supposed to be mailed to HP. I was told that the Geeks had no record of this. I asked to speak to a manager. I never did.   Two weeks later I was called by Best Buy and told that my laptop was repaired. Upon picking up my laptop I was told that it had been tested by the Geeks and that it worked just like new. I tested it myself and it still was non-functioning! I was clearly lied to by the Geek Squad. I asked to speak to the manager. I was told there wasn't one available. I asked that a manager call me. They never did. I still have no idea what is happening with my laptop. The Middletown, RI Best Buy is a disaster and should be avoided at all costs! David of Middletown, RI     1/20/09  I wanted to order software from Best Buy on line. Before I did I wanted to be sure I was purchasing the correct software so I called the store to speak to someone in the Geek Squad. I started dialing at 10:11am and by 10:45am there still was no answer. I finally was able to get through at 11:10 but by then I had already gone on line and ordered software from another company other then Best Buy.  Elizabeth of Philadelphia, PA     1/12/09  Ibought a Gateway laptop in May of 2007. I also purchased the 3year service plan covering anything that happened to the computer.I dropped off my computer on Dec 21st to be repaired. It is now January 8th and my computer is still at the repair center in TN,they told me it would be ready to pick up on January 7th.It could be another week before I receive my computer. I am a student and It is very hard to be without my laptop.I paid $300.00 for that service plan. I don't understand why it wasn't replaced since the equipment was faulty after a year and 8 months of owning the computer. It should have been replaced.When I do call to check the status of my computer the geek squad employees are very rude.I'm afraid that I might not even receive my computer back at all. I use my computer to do research for school (college projects).I also must travel to the library everytime I need to gain access to information.It becomes a huge inconvienence and this is why I spent my hard earned money to get the laptop in the first place.  Amy of Deland, Fl, FL     1/8/09  I had to return a Dell Laptop because it was defective back to bestbuy. Geek suad checked it and confirmed it was defective. I ended up exchanging it for a sony vaio and paid more money. Bestbuy charged me a restocking fee of 90 dollars and plus failed to return the 39.99 optamization fee as well. I feel we were taken advantage of and were treated very poorly by these employees. All We want is fairness. Please help !!!  I lost about $140.00 dollars because I was unfairly charged and this is a violation of bestbuys own policy's as listed behind their reciept. I have also suffered extreme embarrassment/ humiliation and feel it was very discriminating.  Sheralyn of Forest Hills, NY     1/4/09  Purchased 4 yr ext. warranty on a 52 television - its now 3 1/2 years later. Reported problem 2nd week of Dec. Repair subcontractor determined the TV should be replaced (cost to repair exceeds the value). The Geek Squad the Home Theatre Specialist Best Buy employs have been sitting on a replacement authorization number required to initiate the replacement. Each time I call I am told 1-2 business days I will have it. Nothing. Obviously this isn't a law suit. It is an inconvenience to not have a television after purchasing a $400 warranty plan to avoid such a situation. With the New Year's sales around the corner, I could benefit greatly if I could replace the TV soon. Laura of Delta, PA     12/31/08  I purchased a Emachines from Best Buy on 9/4/08. Best Buy load all program to the computer. I tried using mu headphone and mic on the pc and it would not work. I called Best Buy and was put through to the Geek Squad they didnt even try to help me me,they told me to bring it in. I took it in on 12/5/08 and was told the the motherboad need to be replaced. Just to back track when i received the pc the speaker were working. I got a call to pick up the PC on December 16th to pick up my pc. I did and I asked the rep that was dealing with me if all was well, he told me yes.  When I got home I found out the the speaker wasnt working, the headphone phone was but the speakers wasnt. I called Best Buy again and was told to call Emachine. I called Emachine machine and the rep trouble shoot the machine with me on the line and told me that the speaker was not good. He told me to to return it where I purchase the pc. He gave me a return reference number, 1-46JQCX.  I called Best Buy and Bob told me that they dont have any control over that and I should call Best Buy coorperate office. They lady check the return reference number and said why didnt they replace the speaker and should go back to Best Buy in West Paterson. I called Best Buy in West Paterson and was told by Bob they they can not do anything about that and in plain language I should go buy one.  nothing was done in regards to my speakers. I am out of a speaker. When this problem started my machine wasnt 4 montht old. Marcia of Paterson, NJ     12/24/08  Took laptop in to get serviced. Went to the Geek Squad desk and waited... and waited. There were quite a few service staff standing around talking (some personal some work) and no one asked if we needed any help. There were 3 or 4 people in the Geek Squad room behind the desk that we were waiting at .... they all saw us ... and no one came to help us. ... we just kept waiting... I finally asked one of the service people that was walking past me if I could get some help.... he said questioningly ... from the Geek Squad ?? .... I said yes.... I was standing at the Geek Squad Service Desk.... what did he think.... he went into the back and about another 5 minutes a service guy came out and when I told him the problem he said they could help me and I had to send it to HP for service.... when I asked for an address or phone number he said he didn't have it handy.... I asked him to find it.... he was very upset by this... I will not ever shop and Best Buy again.... I cannot believe that all these service personnel standing around and walking past us and no one asked if they could help us and then when I finally got someone to help, they were very unfriendly, unhelpful. They looked at us as if we were disturbing their space.  Glenda of Kars, ON     12/24/08  On August 24, 2008 I purchased a Samsung 46 LCD HDTV with 1080 P at 1499.99, a T.V. calibration for 249.99 and the extended 4 year Black Tie Performance Service Plan for 219.99. On October 2nd, I came to return the product because the T.V. had 3 defected pixels, the back lighting was blotchy and the graphic engine DNIe would not turn on. They said they would not let us return it because it was past 30 days, they told us we needed to call the geek squad and have them come out to assess the problem to see if it the T.V. needed repair or replacement. I called on Oct. 20th, talked with Geek Squad, and they told us they could see we purchased the warranty but they could not retrieve the warranty information on our acct. They said I would need to go to the store to reprint the receipt in order to acquire the warranty number, but since I was covered under a 1 yr manufacture warranty they could continue to send the claim information. They said they would send the claim information to a third party (Precision Television Service) and that the third party would contact us in 2 -3 business days for an appointment for service. They did not contact me.  On Oct. 29th I called Precision Television Service to ask why they have yet to call me, they said they had not received any claim information from BEST BUY, and that they would call me back when they received the information. On Nov. 3rd, we called Precision Television again and they said that they still had not received any claim information from Best Buy. I called Best Buy, and asked why they had not sent any claim information, they said that they would resend it and Precision would call me back in 2-3 business days to schedule a service date. Precision called and left a message stating that they could have given us service on Tuesday Nov. 4th but they needed additional information, therefore they could not proceed with the service.  On Thursday, Nov. 7, I called Best Buy and asked why it was that they did not send all of the necessary information for me to receive service. Best buy said they would call Precision and give them the additional information for me to receive service. They said that they would place a note on my acct to cancel the scheduled TV Calibration for Nov. 8th since the T.V. was defected. Precision was supposed to contact me to schedule service. Again when they called, they said they still required additional information in order to proceed with service. I contacted Best Buy on November 12, and spoke with a woman named Jessica ext. 155140. She told me that she found the warranty information and it was put under my wife's telephone number, which is why they were unable to retrieve it previously. I asked to receive service directly from the Geek squad. She that they would be more than happy to do so since they were trying to eliminate using service from third parties. She said that she would have a scheduling specialist to call me back within 24 hours to schedule me for a service. No call was received.  I called Best Buy again on Nov. 25th. I explained my frustration with the delay and incompetence in service, and told them that a complaint would be filed unless this matter was resolved. The agent then scheduled a maintenance appointment for Dec. 17, from 12-4p.m. He confirmed the appointment three times during the phone call. On December 17, I called Geek Squad at 7:00am to confirm the appointment. They said that their computer showed there was no appointment scheduled on the acct. Four days later, on Dec. 20, Best Buy left a message to reschedule the appointment. They called again on Sunday. Agent Smith explained that an appointment was scheduled for December 17 but did not know why the computer failed to show it on that day. Best Buys performance service plan states to include prompt, professional product service. I have not received either prompt or professional service from the company. There is no physical damage, only inconvenience and lost time from prearranged appointments that were never filled by Best Buy. Ryan of Tucson, AZ     12/22/08  Bought 19 TV for son, speaker died on one side, took to Best Buy to ship out from Tallahassee, FL to Tampa, FL. Tampa, FL says they never received the TV and Best Buy in Tallahassee has no record of it being dropped off. I was given a piece of paper that said it would be shipped back on Dec. 8, 2008. I do not have that piece of paper and now I am out the TV (old one unrepaired or new one).  This is called stealing, fraud, theft, you name it - an all of it is illegal. They have nothing in their computer system and I am the person who is at fault because I cannot prove that the TV was dropped off. Please do whatever you can to sue them. They deserve it. I am a single parent with little money and two kids. I work for the State of Florida and times are difficult for everyone. This should not be allowed to happen. loss of 19 TV that was sent to repair Elizabeth of Tallahassee, FL     12/15/08  I purchased a 30in Samsung television from Best Buy at Secaucus NJ. We purchased the extended warranty to cover any product malfunction up to including replacement. The television had problems turn on and off on its own,discoloration on the screen and the sound will shift from side to side. I placed the first service phone call on August 15th, 2008 it is now December 11th nothing has been resolved. The last time a technician came to the house on December 2nd he replaced two pieces and now the television does not turn on.  All I wanted was for best buy to fix the problem. Four months and not one person accountable for the situation. I need at this point for my television to be replaced. I think the word customer service means nothing to this company. They have incompetent people working for them. They offered the best technicians not once has they been able to fix the problems. In one of the many phone call one David from Geek Squad told me that if it takes one year for the problem to be fixed it takes a year. The stress that this situation has caused is tremendous. I feel nobody cares how I feel. I has cross my mind they are doing this because I live in the Bronx. I wonder if the treatment will be different if I live some place else. No one has compensated me for every time I used the minutes in my cell phone. I feel trap in a never ending situation. I don't know if the company will be able to resolve the situation. I am a unhappy customer that never in a million year expected this treatment from Best Buy. Cruz of Bronx, NY     12/12/08  I purchased a new HP laptop in on or around July 4, 2008 along with an extended 2-yr service plan through the Geek Squad. On November 7, 2008, I noticed that I could not connect to the internet. After contacting my ISP as well as HP, I was advised to return the laptop to the Geek Squad at Bestbuy, which is what I did that same day. I went into the store on November 7 and completed the paperwork to have the problem diagnosed. On November 9, I was called by a recording which said to come down to the store to pick up the laptop. I was surprised that it would be ready so quickly, but not know what the problem was, I figured it may be something reasonable.  When I arrived at the store, I was told that the problem was a faulty hard drive which would have to shipped to their service center to be repaired - estimated time would be 3-4 weeks. On November 21, I was called by a Geek Squad representative who told me that my computer never got shipped on November 9. Apparently, someone put the wrong tag on the laptop and it had been sitting in the store all this time. Since Nov 21 is a Friday, the laptop would be shipped on Monday, Nov 24. They said they would expedite things and I could have it back in 2 weeks. Obviously, this is just before Thanksgiving, so I was not happy. I am also a college student and this was around mid-terms and approaching my final exam period, so the hardship on me was difficult.  After a few weeks, I called the store on December 6, only to be told that the service center fixed the hard drive, but while it was in their possession, they broke the motherboard. On December 11, I got a call from the Bestbuy store saying that the laptop had finally arrived, however, the damage done to the motherboard and subsequent speaker system was still NOT repaired and would have to be sent back out to the service center.  At this point, it has been over a month since they have had my laptop. I have not gotten an apology or any type of reassurance that they will fix my product. Christmas is coming up and I would like to have my laptop back BEFORE that time. I want an apology since they have damaged my equipment, but no one at Bestbuy, the service center or the Geek Squad seem to be too concerned about their lack of commitment to service and customer satisfaction. Kathy of Washington, DC     12/11/08  I purchased a Dell Lap top from Best buys in June 2008. Last week 11/26/08 an error message came up so I took it into the geek counter at the Towson store and was told I needed a new hard drive. I was told that it was covered under the manufacturer warranty. I left it and recieved a call on Saturday 11/29 saying it had been repaired. I picked it up on Saturday and tried to use it on Sunday yesterday 11/30/08 and immediately got another error message and nothiced before the message it kept skipping while trying to use it. I carried it back to the Best Buys store today and was told the hard drive was gone up. I was so upset because this is a computer that is six months old and two hard drives have been put in the unit.  I told Bill at Geek squad at Best Buys don't you think there is something wrong with the computer since the hard drives keep going up? He told me at first there was little they could do. I asked to seen the manager and Dave came over saying they would send it back to Dell. I asked for the phone number for Dell and called while I stood at the counter waiting. I got a man who asked for the numbers from the bottom of the computer and when I told him what happen he told me they wanted nothing to do with Best Buys and that if there was problems it was Best Buys problem he also mentioned that if you make a purchase from Best Buys and there is a problem take it back to the store. By the way he was in India and very frank saying I bascially only thing I could do is deal with Best Buys. I explain again that they computer hard drive was covered under the manufacture warrantly.  Now Bill hears the conversation and tells me that they would install another hard drive there in the store. Bill said that is all the Geek squad headquaters was going to do. I spoke to the manager Scott when the hard drive originally went up telling him I would have to buy another computer because I must have one for my business. OK now I get it Best Buys sells the products and if anything goes wrong and you have a warranty they will do some limited things to resolve the issue but if it is older than 14 days too bad. They told me something about the enviroment and other junk.  I didn't bother telling them that I own an Internet radio station and have multiple servers housed in a data center and work with computers 24/7 so I certainly know the best enviroment and how to care for my computers. Best Buys wants to sell the products and then tell you you are on your own. If Best Buy had any ethic they would have just replaced the faulty lap top and sent the faulty one to the manufacturer. Instead they give you the run around and Dell says they can't do anything to help me and want nothing to do with Best Buys.  I have been greatly incovienced and unable to do my work. That is in addition to the mental and personal anguish I experienced in the store. It is so sad that today customers are treated so badly and Dell I have nothing good to say about them and will never purchase any of their products ever again and will tell everyone I know to do so also. Thank you for any help you can give me. Wenda of Baltimore, MD     12/1/08  I am writing because of some of the complaints on your site. The person that said Best Buy refused to honor the last few months of the warranty after having the set unsuccessfuly worked on I do not believe. I do know from experience that customers might not tell everything that happened. I am one of those repair shops that you refur to as one that you would never use.  My technicians are all factory trained and bonded. We have to be checked out before we are excepted for the Best Buy program or any of the other programs we administer. We also are authorized service center for the brand we are servicing. We have been repairing consumer electronics for 25 years and have a very good reputation.  I have been doing Best Buy's work for over 10 years and I will admit that they are far from perfect but they are trying very hard to take care of there customers. I agree that most extended warrantys are not worth the money but I do recommend them on High-end camcorders and large (not 32) flat screen TVs to my customers. I see very high repair bills all the time and the only ones that get repaired are the ones with extended warrantys.  I have several large flat screens that have been scrapped by the customer because of the cost to repair. I also see sets that we can't get parts for and Best Buy will go to bat with the factory for you and replace the set if parts can't be found. Some of the sets are still under the factory warranty but Best Buy still tries to take care of their customer.  If you want to get mad at someone you should blame the shoddy products that most manufacturers are selling and the lack of spare parts. I see sets all the time that are less than a year old but the factory cannot provide parts. These are household brand named products not off the wall Chinese junk.  The customers also have to take part of the blame. All most of you want is the cheapest price you can find. But then you expect free delivery, free setup, free lessons on how to operate the set, free service calls because you will not read the owners manaul, and the cheap set to perform like the high-end product. All this support cost money and the stores have to train people to do the work. That cost has to be added to the price of the product. This country used to have many local stores that spent money training their salsesman and techs but they could not compete with the big box stores on price. Since customers are not willing to pay for that the local stores are gone. My grandmonther new you get what you pay for.  One of the manufaturers I do repairs for did a national survey a few years ago and the average age of a electronics repair tech was 42 years old. The reason is that a tech can make more money in another field of electronics and have alot less hassle. He doesn't have to deal with unrealistic retail customers or factories that pay 1970s rates and give no support. Does that scare you? It should. I hate to think how upset customers will be when they have to send their product to a regional depot for several months because their local TV shop closed it's doors.  For the woman that can't take off work to have something repaired. We do our best to accommodate the customer's schedule but you might try working with the tech. as well. Believe it or not most of us have kids and wifes we like to see just like you do!   Richard of Midland, TX     12/1/08  Bought a Hewlett Packard M8100n x2 Model # GC673AA 7/8/2007. Paid 2,145.10 which included HP 19" screen and other software. The extras were needed because of the small business we own. We also paid over 300.00 extra for Geek Squad. An appointment was set for 7/20/07 at out home. Everything stayed in boxes. The appointment was cancelled by the Geek Tech. A second appt was set for 8/14/07. The very first thing he said as he was hooking everything up was that something was wrong with the Hard Drive. He also added that he could work with it to make it right. My husband and I were not worried, because we knew that he would.   9/6/07 we called best buy to complain of windows popping up to initiate a sleep of some sort. I was confused and we hoped that someone at Best Buy would know. We took the tower to Best Buy 9/6/07. Received a comment " Unit has passed all hardware diagnostics, consisting of PC check as well as memtest. Unit has many corrupted and missing files. Please reinstall vista in precinct". My husband and I were convinced that the problem was fixed. Understanding that our business had to hold all computer transactions during this time in repair. Best Buy has a history of everything that they did with all of this equipment. Out Tower paid another visit to Best Buy for another issue a couple months later.   I finally followed it and took all my notes to ask for new equipment. They refused because we had gone beyond our 2 week alloted warranty after purchasing. I informed the tech that it had stayed in boxes for a month waiting for the Geek squad person. He said that they could fix it by sending it away but could not refund us. I left frustrated and still hoped they would help us. Everything was fine and a couple months went by. Finally after 8 months had expired which brought us to a year, the system started acting up. We were informed that after 3 times, we could be refunded. I knew that Best Buy was no help so we called a friend to possibly get us up and running. He explained that our Hard Drive had crashed.  Now, I'm not a computer wiz and both my husband and I have been very patient. I had to pay out 400.00 more to rebuild our hard drive and clean it for personal pics. Best buy quoted us around 1,000.00 to help build and clean out pics. I hope someone can help us. We used a Hewlett Packard for 10 years before this one and never had a problem. I want an answer. I feel that we have been taken. Everything is working fine for now, but how long. We would like to buy a laptop and always felt comfortable with Best Buy. They were worthless in their answers. Our 1 year warranty has now passed. Please e-mail me or call. We welcome any response. Thank you.  Christine of Norway, ME     11/24/08  I purchased a 4 year extended warranty from Best Buy when I purchased a Sony TV. Three years later the bulb in the TV needed a replacement. I called Best Buy on November 10th, and told them that I needed a replacement bulb for my TV. They told me the soonest they could have someone come out to the house for an in-home repair was the 15th.  Five days later, the technician from Geek Squad arrives. He looks at the TV and says, yep, it needs a replacement bulb. He didn't come with a bulb. And, it will take 3 to 5 business days to order one. So on the 19th, we get a call saying the bulb has come in, but the soonest that they can get someone out to put it in the TV is on the 26th, a full WEEK later. Replacing a bulb is a quick, easy thing that I could do myself, and the only reason for having Best Buy do it is because it's covered under the warranty. So, I ask to speak with a manager and am put on hold for over 36 minutes. Then, the manager says she can't do anything about it until the next day because it's after normal business hours, but the only reason it was after normal hours is because I was kept on hold for so long!  First of all, almost three weeks without a television. Then, the cost of the cable service that's sitting unused because I haven't been able to watch TV for three weeks. Also, the fact that I paid $400 for a warranty and the customer service I've recieved has been terrible. Katie of Phoenix, AZ     11/20/08  I bought a Whirpool washing machine from Best Buy in Juy, 2008. It stopped working on October 15, 2008. I have had a Geek Squad rep out 2x to fix it and seperately, a Whirpool rep 2x to fix it, and all total, 6 parts have been ordered and the machine is still not fixed. Yesterday, November 15, the latest Whirlpool rep arrived, could not fix it and ordered yet another part and told me he would be next Saturday to try to fix it.  Frustrated, I went to Best Buy with the 6 parts I did have and placed them on the Customer Service counter and requested a new washter - as I have been out of one for month and paid $750 for the lemon of a washer. Best Buy Customer Service was rude, not accomodating at all and told me Whirlpool can only authorize a replacement. Interesting since both the Best Buy Geek Squad and Whirlpool reps had both told me only Best Buy can only authorize the replacement after 3 visits.  I have a Best Buy Geek Squad rep coming out on Tuesday. By next Saturday, I will have had 3 visits from each, and probably no new washer not the current one fixed. I am beyond frustated and in tears - litteraly.  DO NOT EVER buy a washer from Best Buy or any applicance. It is just not worth it, the frustration and the Customer Service is unbelievably horrible!  Mary of Columbia, MD     11/16/08  I took my computer to Best Buy to be serviced because it was running slow. The saleman told me I had a virus after running the computer for about 15 seconds. I was charged $199.00 plus tax for a full virus checkup. I didn't think my computer had a virus because I ran my Norton Protection before I brought it to the store, and no virus was found. Also, it took him only 15 seconds to determine it had a virus, and I thought maybe he's rushing with me so he can help the girls that were next in line. They were young, very attractive, and he was flirting with one of them. So I told him I did not think I had a virus. I have Norton Protection on my computer. My computer was repaired there previously for a virus. After my computer was repaired I bought vius protection like they suggested. He said Norton can't catch everything and there are new virus out. I figured maybe he know what he's talking about,he's the expert. About three days later I called Best Buy to inquire about the computer. I was told they never got to the computer to service it, it would take a couple of days or more. They will call me when it's finished. After I got off the phone I went to Best Buy , and asked for the computer that they never serviced. Three days was too long for me. Especially since they hadn't even gotten to it. A salesman went to the back and got the computer. He did not get it from the side where they put repaired computers waiting for customers pick-up. I know their procedure because I had my computer serviced there before, for a virus.  A salesman got the computer from the back. He decided to run it before he gave it to me. It was running too slow. He said it would take a while. I could walk around the store. Then he went to help other customers in line. I walked around the store until it's finished. Then he went to help another customer. When I came back the guy that ran the computer was working with another customer. So a female salesperson came over to help me. She looked at the computer and said she did not see a virus, and the computer seemed okay. I told her that was strange because I just got off the phone with them, and was told they never got to my computer to repair it. If they never repaired it, it should still have a virus. They said it would take a couple of days or more before they could get to it, and they would call me. I was confused, because in the beginning I was told I had a virus. On the phone I was told they never repaired it. Now she's telling me there is no virus. She said if there is a problem bring it back. I tooked the computer home. The computer was running the exact same way it ran when brought it to Best buy. Therefore, I took the computer back to Best. The same female helped me. She ran it and told me it did not have a virus, it was running slow, and advised me on what part to buy to get it running again. I bought the part she suggested, took my computer home, and put the part in the computer. After that the computer was running again. The problem was my computer had too many games, and downloaded programs. It ran perfect after I bought the part to add more space. I also took off some of the games. I had over 60 games downloaded. I never had a virus problem. My computer was never serviced for a virus because I picked it up before they repaired it, and the female salesperson admitted it did not have a virus. The salesman that started off helping me didn't tell her it was in for a virus and I was taking it out because the wait was too long. So she spilled the beans because she didn't know what was going on. I called to inquire about the return of my money. The manager was not in. So I called days later and was told I had to write the company. I felt jipped, and figured I wouldn't get my money back anyway.  I eventually wrote a letter to Best Buy to explain what happened, and never heard anything from them. I think they just ignored the letter.  I think Best Buy should return my money because they charged me for a full virus cleanup when my computer was running slow. Also they never repaired it or cleaned it for a virus or anything else because they didn't get a chance to get to my computer before I got it out. I fixed my own computer with a part I purchased from them and put in myself.  Julia of New Orleans, LA     11/12/08  I bought a flat screen, high definition TV last November (Magnavox) from Best Buy. About 2 months ago it started shutting off on its own and then restarting. I brought it back to Best Buy 6 weeks ago and haven't heard from them since. They told me it would be ready between 1-2 weeks. Every time I call they say they're waiting for a part and there's nothing they can do. They would put it on an alert.  I am totally frustrated with Best Buy and Magnavox's quality. I've been passed around from one person to another person on the phone and then put on hold for quite a while. I have also bought other products from Best Buy (Frigidaire). After 3 years my motor went on my refrigerator and after 4 years the glass on my oven door broke (after doing the self-cleaning).  The economic damage is paying for the motor myself. I have asked Frigidaire to split it with me to no avail. I would also like my oven door fixed. I am afraid to do the self-cleaning for fear that it now might shatter. Karen of Watertown, MA     11/8/08  I called back in October 08 about my Insigna 32 in TV that I purchase in 11-07. The picture was disarrayed and many different colors. They said they would send out a geek. He came and took it apart on 10-11 and said oh I have to order a part. We have been going back and forth & I was told finally on Oct 31 that someone would call me about coming in to pick up a new TV.  I still have not heard anything from that call as well as many other calls I have made. This has been over a Month with out a TV and I am suppose to be patient with Best Buy and the Geeks. This is very disturbing to me if this is how a business is run and how other customers are treated. I can not under stand how it would take so long to get one part for a TV and if there were a problem why a part was not Up's in one day to satisfy a customer.  I know when I get this taken care of and hopefully soon I will not be buying another thing from this store. I think I would have gotten better service from Walmart. Why do I have to have some to call me to instruct me on how I should bring a TV back to store to receive another one. This is crazy. Hopefull I will hear something soon from someone.  Linda of Chesapeake,, VA     11/5/08  I purchased a dell computer along with a printer and paid $599.00 for computer, 59.99 for printer and 279.00 for service contract on Sept 26th 2008. I had problems with installing the printer and contacted HP for two days they tried to install in over the phone and finally told me to take it back to the store since I had a service contract. I returned on Oct 18th which was past the 14day return policy.  They had it for two days and talked me into a optimatzation on the computer for 49.00. They said it would help the computer I also paid 49.99 to install printer. It did not work when I got home and windows kept having a problem and shutting down. I returned it on Oct 20th for repair and have still not received it back. The dept that repairs them in Best Buy keeps sending emails that my computer is in good hands. I purchased this for work and now have to go to my daughters to complete my assignments. Since its purchase on Sept 26th, the computer has been in repair more than I have had it at home. I need to know what my options are. I have put a dispute in on the credit card but it is a Best Buy card. I purchased my computer for job and have to go elsewhere to complete assignments.When I try to contact them I am placed on hold and no one ever comes back. It is very frustrating Carolyn of Deer Park, NY     11/4/08  Last year in 2007, I purchased an ASUS Gaming Laptop from these jokers. It had issues with the wireless card. When I took it back to them, the Geek Squad push the power button, turning it on, and said it works. I told them that they were not dealing with someone who does not understand computers, furthermore letting them know that their in violation of their policy by not supporting their warranty. After having enough of their non-sense, I left the computer there at the store.  Of course I had my receipt and called Bestbuy Corporate. I told them if they did not refund my money which was used in down payment with their phony credit card, I would take legal action against them. It didn't take long and their Consumer Affairs/Legal representative called me back. She tried to throw me a curve with her legal limbo knowledge. However I informed her that I have a business degree and know the laws of business inside and out.  They ended up settling with me without having to go to court, however I feel sorry for many of you that have been burnt by these counterfeits. Unfortunately My wife decided to give them another chance and order some DVD's at bestbuy.com. They seem to be up to no-good once again. I called them today 10/30/08, and I was as kind as I could be. However, I'm only giving them a reasonable time frame to send these DVD'S, before taking action against them.  Scott of Kendallville, IN     10/30/08  When I purchased a tv and home theater system the agent told me that an extended warranty with a Geek Squad installation would provide that a repairman would come out for any problem. The first thing to go was the remote. When I called I was told I had to bring the remote in. Since they did not have a similar remote I had to wait until they could ship me one. I then had to schedule three different times to have GS come out and reinstall.  The first time they were late so had to reschedule, the second time their laptop did not work for the programming so had to reschedule, the third time the remote battery would not recharge so that is when they said I had to take it in. When I finally got it back the DVD receiver sound was defective so they said I had to take that in. Took it in, all guts replaced and picked it up. GS came out and said now it did not work at all. Took it in, got a call from the technician asking why I sent it in as it worked fine for him. They sent it back to store, Ipicked it up and scheduled GS with original crew. Just got call that new crew is coming out so it will take them much longer to install. I feel I was deceived by the agent who sold me the warranty that I would have an agent come out to fix any probolems. Manager, although slightly apologetic, said there was nothing he could do.  I hope I can find another electronics supplier to work with in the future.  Michael of Willis, TX     10/29/08  On 2/1/07 I purchased an HP desktop computer, Microsoft Software, and services of the Geek Squad to load & install software that I had purchased, transfer software from my old PC, delivery & set-up of the new PC, computer optimization, etc. Part of the services mentioned here was to correctly load the operating system and software. Until recently, there seemed to be no problem. Now I receive an error message each and every time I start the PC. The message is that Im running low on disk space on drive D. Upon investigation Ive found that Office Files are on drive D. Drive D is normally and usually used for recovery purposes and no software is to be loaded on this drive. This is causing problems with my PC.  Today, October 22, 2008, I drove to the Best Buy store where I purchased the PC. Having purchased a 2 year on-site service contract, I felt that this problem that was caused by Best Buy would be taken care of. Terry L, highest ranking person in the store at that time of day, according to him, told me he cant fix this problem for free. He will have to charge me to fix a problem (that was originally caused by the Geek Squad) because of the time that had lapsed since purchase. I only had 30 days after purchase to notify Best Buy of the problem. I explained over and over that this problem just came up and why it was a Best Buy error to load the office files in the wrong drive. Verification of this is to look at the date of install of the office files and it will be shown that the files are dated at the time of installation.  Since I was only getting more and more upset by this attitude of I cant do anything for you when clearly it was Best Buys error, I left the store with no resolution except to bring my PC tower in the store for an unspecified period of time while they fix the problem that they would charge me for. There is absolutely no way I can be without my computer for multiple days. My living depends on PC access. There is absolutely no way I will pay Best Buy to fix a mistake that they made originally.  As I was leaving the store, a gentleman and his young son were standing next to me and told me that Best Buy did the exact same thing to him. This problem needs a resolution by Best Buy and that resolution is to take responsibility for their error and fix the problem for free.   Carla of Las Vegas, NV     10/23/08  We bought an Acer computer from the Best Buy store in Bangor Maine. We live over one and twenty hundred miles from this store, as we live in a rural northern Maine town. From the first day we brought this junk pile home, it has not worked properly. The first problem is that it wouldn't recognize the internet connection, so it would not go on line. We took it back, and was told there was nothing wrong with it. We thought that this was strange, but since they wouldn't do anything more for us, we went home, and it worked. Then, we downloaded some software that we bought with the computer, and it turned out to be incompatible with the systems, so it corrupted the drivers. We were told by Geek Squad that we had to bring it back to them to check it out.  So back to Best Buy we went AGAIN. The saleman that sold us the computer and software told us that it was compatible, but apparently the software was for a 32 bit system, and ours was a 64 bit system. Best Buy told us that we needed to have the entire system cleaned out. It would cost $130.00. I argued with them until they admitted that it was their fault and swept the system for free. They also told us that there is almost no software out for 64 bit systems bcause its so new, so we can't download naything on it. We bring it home, AGAIN and about two weeks later, it won't recognize the internet connection, AGAIN. We take it back AGAIN. This time they have to send the computer out to ACER themselves to solve the problem because they can't figure it out.  By this time, I am so mad that I go to Wal-Mart and buy an HP like I wanted to in the first place. Which, by the way is the computer that I am writing to you on, and it works perfectly. My wife called Best Buy a couple of days ago, and asked if the computer was ready, and what was wrong. She was told it was back, and the motherboard had been replaced. We were not impressed as this computer is now barely three months old and a major component has been replaced.  Today, I get a call from Geek squad telling me that the computer was still not running right, and did not pass the store's inspection, so they were going to have to send it back, again. They told me on my voicemail that I needed to call them and approve them sending it back to ACER. I was so screaming mad that my wife had to call for me instead. She told them that we would not accept this computer back, and that we either should get a new replacement, or get our money back. We are waiting for the Geek squad supervisor to call her back. I doubt that we'll get anywhere with them.  This ordeal has now costed us over $2,000.00. The ACER computer was just over $700.00. We have made four trips to the store we bought it in, and we still have to go back and pick it up again. So, we've put over 1000 miles on our car running this computer up and down the highway. That's alot of gas money Plus it takes at least 5 hours round trip. So we have over twenty hours lost time, and we usually have to buy a meal. Then, since we need a computer for our daughter, which is why we bought that ACER in the first, we had to buy a second computer to replace the first one at over $700.00.  We're getting the run around. either way, I'm about done with Best Buy and ACER. ACER does't even have a tab on their web site for people to contact them directly. So you have to go through several middlemen to get anywhere. I'm almost fearful of them giving us a replacement computer since we've had so many problems with this one. But, we should get some kind of satisfaction out of this. Stephen of Houlton, ME     10/22/08  i purchased a laptop for my daughter's birthday in april. i asked for certain programs and warranty and specified to eric that it was for an 11 yr old so i wanted specific warranty. he said he put. i went the next day, her birthday, with her to pick it up, brought it home only to find that the programs i had paid for were not installed. i had to leave her birthday party to go back to the store and have it corrected only to be accused by the employee of fraud and i showed him the receipt that i had paid for the installations. when he felt like it he showed it to another employee who told him that i was correct the work had not been done. he brought in a manager to apologize to me and offer me a gift card ($20) for the inconvenience and i had to looeave it overnight again to be done.  now comes september and she was having problems with the laptop so i took it in for repair they told me it would be about 2-3 weeks. a week later david contacts me from customer service to tell me the repairs are not covered by the warranty and that the laptop that i had purchased for $549 (without counting the installations and warranties) would cost me $891 to fix. he said something had spilled on the laptop, i told him that i had asked for that coverage and he said that it didnt show up but that if i could speak to customer service they could fix it and the warranty adjusted. for 2 days i tried calling and got the run around so i went in person to the store and asked for the manager.  Eaen was called and i explained the situation to him. he had the nerve to tell me to purchase another laptop and he would try to give me 10% off. i told him that all i wanted was the original fixed because i had paid for the warranty i didnt want to be out almost $1000. Eaen then told me to sell the laptops for parts and insisted that i buy another laptop. i got upset at this and asked for the laptop back because i didnt want to be jerked again. is there anything that can be done to stop these people from fooling us? i feel so betrayed and jilted and my daughter cannot even use her birthday gift. i am out a total of $941.76, the purpose of her having the laptop was for school and now i have to run around with her to borrow a laptop whenever she has homework which is often Migdalia of Bronx, NY     10/21/08  I brought in a computer after 1 month of ownership because it was completely un-usable due to some malfunction. The computer would crash and BSOD and not boot up again. I took the computer back and Best Buy kept it for 5 days. When I went to pick it up they said they replaced the Hard Drive and that everything was okay. They didn't offer to recover any of the data from my old Hard Drive, they just took it out and put in a new one. I did recover the data on my own time and expense. They couldn't reinstall the OS for me, so I ordered recovery disks from HP.   When those came, I tried re-installing the OS and at about 3% of the install, the same problem occurred, BSOD and the machine would not even start install the next time I tried. I took the computer back to BB and GS and they said they would look into it. No apologies, no "oops, we didn't fix your problem, what else can we do for you?" They called me back about a day later, went to pick up my computer, they assured me that the computer was working. I got home that night and the machine would not even boot. This made me think that they didn't even turn the thing on to make sure it was working.   At this point I was very frustrated, so I called BB and asked to speak to a manager. The manager was very nice, and went to talk to the Geek Squad, they assured the manager that the machine was in working order and that they tested it. So I brought the machine in that same night and the Geek Squad plugged it in and it started up to a Blue Screen and would not boot up. They looked a bit embarrassed, but then told me the only thing they could do for me at this point was send the machine back to HP. So after a week and a half of dealing with the Geek Squad, they still needed to send it to HP.  I am a freelance Graphic Designer, and have not been able to work for 2 weeks now. The experience with the BB Geek Squad was so horrible that I will not be purchasing anything from Best Buy again. It is a shame to, since I used to use Best Buy for most of my small business purchases and used to refer people to Best Buy. I am now taking an active opposite approach and letting people know about this situation and the poor service provided and pointing people away from Best Buy for purchases and support. I understand that computers have trouble, but the service provided was horrible and has drawn out the problem for far longer than needed. I should have a working computer at my home office, and still do not. Luckily I found a fellow freelance designer who has let me rent some time on his machine in order to keep working. If the Geek Squad knew they couldn't fix the problem they should have sent it back to HP right away.  I was also very disconcerted to hear some conversations between other people and Geek Squad employees, who were selling them services and products that they absolutely did not need, without giving them any options. I talked to one lady in particular about her situation, and she was very surprised to hear that there were 4 or 5 ways to solve her problem, all of which were about half the cost to her and much more convenient. All in all, my experience was the worst I have ever had with any service department. Jacob of Milwaukee, WI     10/13/08  We bought 3 computers from best buy in the last two years and we have had problems like clock work with our Velocity and Hewlet packard for the past year, we have to bring it in every month and we are without our computer from two to one month at a time and they try to charge us $100 to back up the data every time. There is no rhyme or reason to have us bring the computer in so many times, and they should have replaced the computers by now according to their policy, but they have not. Our businesses are affected and we can not perform our duties and the loss of money is beyond repair during down time. Karin of Huntington Beach, CA     10/12/08  On 5-30-08 I purchasesd a 59 inch plasma TV for 2,000.00, plus 318.00 for a extended 4 year warranty. I only had the TV for 4 months. The TV has no picture or sound as of 10-7-08. I called 1-888-bestbuy to have the TV serviced under my warranty. When I called, they couldnt give an appointment to come out to my house until 3 days later. I finally accepted the appointment for friday 10-10-08. I was told I would receive a call from the technician around 7am-9am on 10-10-08 to comfirm a time bracket.  No one never called. So I called the warranty number again. The employee told me that the systems were updating and some how my appointment had been cancelled in the updating process. She also informed me that warrany I had was a special performance warranty, and my TV should have been looked at within 48 hours. I asked to speak to a manager. I was then transfered to Stephanie(manager). She informed me that the next available appt was 10-23-08. Stephanie also told me she knew nothing about systems being updated and appts getting cancelled. Stephanie then told me she would send an email to a local technician and have them call me witin 2 hours. I get a call from the tech, and the tech gives me a number for Samsung and told me I had to have them troubleshoot me over phone!! All of this is because best buy lost my appt in the system allegedly.  I feel like best buy is not keeping their warranty promises. They should not offer a warranty if they cant honor the warranty issued. Im presently taking a TV course for school and this issue is affecting my grade. Im not to sure why the manager was not aware of system updates but other employees were. I think the employee was lying to me because she didnt know what to say. Afer all that I still didnt get an appointment... Rasheeda of Trenton, NJ     10/10/08  My IPod repair at Best Buy was a total diaster. I took the Ipod into Best Buy to repair with my extended warranty on July 2,08. Every other week, I would go in & check on status. The service dept. have lied & took my cell no. that someone will call me tomorrow. Of course no one ever called. This happened until Oct.6,08. Then they said the Ipod has been sent out via UPS from TX repair center. They demanded I bring in proof of address that I've lived in my new address. The next day that I brought in the proofs, the service dept. changed the story again, screaming to me in public that I should track down the package thru UPS. Finally a print out of the UPS shipping infor. was giving to me. I called the TX Best Buy repair Center twice & left the message. No one ever return my calls.  This kind of no service is totally insane. I lost an Ipod worth over $300. plus $69. for the extended warranty that's useless.  Gloria of Southport, NC     10/10/08  purchased an extended warranty for our HDTV. Technician did not call within 3 days listed regarding part order status. He arrived on 9/30/08 did not call. I called was placed on hold- gave up after 40 minutes. today i called again after being shuffled to 4 different people within 45 minutes told the part would not be in until the 23rd of this month. They have the absolute worse customer service and really do not back up their warranties.  I've had problems with them in the past regarding a lap top that I had done something to so the warranty did not cover repair, of course this was not the case as i had an outside technician repair it. i am without a tv for at least a month- my computer had to be repaired out of pocket Dorothy of Duluth, MN     10/7/08  My brother is on disability. It took him two years to save for a new computer. So to be safe, he bought the extended warranty for an extra $200 bucks above the $1400 dollar price tag on the computer. What a joke. Our computer started having some issues a couple of years after we bought it. No big deal we thought, we bought the extended warranty right? Wrong. My brother called Best Buy and they told him they don't handle problems in house so it has to be shipped somewhere.  We shipped it out, got it back, problem. The computer was still not acting right. He called again and was told they just replaced the mother board. So, in other words, they didn't bother to try and find and diagnose the problem? They just replace the mother board without even seeing if the mother board was the cause? They told us they'd sent out their Geek Squad guys to our apartment since he also paid for home service. He wishes he had done that in the first place. With most things like this, you have to schedule an appointment. My brother is on disability, so the guy shows up too early, my brother can't get to the door, and the guy leaves. My brother calls Best Buy only to be told the guy has no intentions of coming back and my brother will have to reschedule.  When a guy does finally show up for the next appointment, he's rude, and treats my brother like an idiot. He replaces the hard drive without diagnosing the problem. He leaves and eventually, the computer starts acting glitchy again. So clearly, the new motherboard and hard drive, did not fix it. My brother makes another appointment, this time (the guy is a jerk again) they replace some other stuff. Same result after he leaves, computer is not ok.  My brother finds out that Best Buy can substitute generic parts, instead of installing the original brand parts that came with your computer. The memory card they gave us, did not have as much memory as our original card and was a cheap generic. Also, the guy from the first visit took to case screws from our computer, along with the old hard drive, and claimed he can't find the case screws. My brother is now so frustrated, he goes to Best Buy demanding our original hard drive and the case screws. Best Buy says they will set up another apartment visit, and put back some of the original hard ware. They send another guy, and this time, he's not such a jerk. He puts back our original hard drive and the rest of the original stuff but leaves the [bad] new memory chip.  Our computer is now working again, but the memory chip has made everything slower. If they had just replaced the memory chip in the first place, when my brother shipped it out, instead of replacing the mother board, which was apparently fine, it would not have taken several months, for our computer to get fixed. My brother is now spending his own money, on getting a better memory chip since Best Buy will only give us a generic one. Extended warranty? What a complete waste of money.  Mmmm of Ingleside, IL     9/13/08  My compaq laptop working even though it is less than 1 yr old. Best Buy and HP refuse to help me. They refused to allow me to speak with a supervisor.  I cannot complete school because of no computer or use it to access medical resources at work that I need to do my job. I'd like the computer fixed. It worked until 3 weeks ago. The damage is not accidental and a computer should not quit after 8 months Cindy of Cedar Rapids, IA     8/28/08  I Purchased IPOD Classic 80G on 6/10/08. Also puchased extended warranty $59.00. The IPod was considered defective by the Busy Buy Geek Tech, after approx. 6 weeks of use. Also by the repair company. The Tech stated it would be returned to factory and replaced with a NEW IPod. I returned to Best Buy one week later to Pick-Up my replacement. I asked the manager if the IPod is a NEW one, since I observed the packaged IPod rattled inside the box. She stated Yes it is new. It was not New, it was a refurbished IPod.  I called the manager of the Geek Squad about the IPod 2 hours later, telling her I was mislead into believing my IPod would be a new replacement. I did not get any results from my compaint. Best Buy stated that it was my responsibility to return the product within 30 days from purchase. EXCUSE ME! The IPOD revealed problems 40 days after purchase.  Best Buy suggested I could BUY a new IPOD, if I didn't want the used replacement. Best Buys does not appreciate how much I have spent on numerous purchases in the past year. NO MORE. Bye-Bye to Best Buy.  I am stuck with a used ipod. In other words, $300.00, plus, for a used IPod. Nannette of Bradenton Beach, FL     8/26/08  I purchased a computer package from Best Buy on 4/9/08. In June i began having problems with the system. Took it in and the Mother Board had to be replaced. July 2008, the modem had to be replaced. August I had to take it back again....modem was replaced again. I was told on 8/08/08 by a geek squad agent that the system would be replaced since I had incurred so many problems with the new system. However, when I was called in to pick up the system, I was informed that the manufactuers had to ok the swap out.  I contacted the manufacturer and was told by a Phillip that it was Best Buy's responsibility. I was at the customer service desk and informed the geek squad agent of the same and he spoke with the manufacturer. The agent hooked the system up and told the manufacturer the system was working. I was given the option by the manufacturer to send the machine to them and they would fix it or replace it with a rebuilt system. I was told by Best Buy that they could not swap out the system. I'd only had the new system since April and was unable to use the computer more than half the time.  I didn't want a refund from Best Buy, I just wanted a machine that worked. I paid for a new machine and I believe I am entitled to a new machine that works properly. Needless to say, I was sent home with the repaired system. After getting it home, the machine still did not operate properly. What is my recourse, if any. Seems like Best Buy's motto is You Brought It, Now You Are Stuck With It!. They did not say that, but I can read between the lines. Geneva of Darlington, SC     8/26/08  I purchased a brand new computer in Sacramento at BB for my daughter to use in college. Then I asked that it be set up and they sent out Geek Squad. The computer was $660; the service was $130. We got down to Northridge and it immediately got two viruses; the GS did not put any virus protection on it and I'm sure I wanted that.  Had to take it to BB Northridge; he said it would be another $130 to fix it and put on her files. After that she got it home; files cannot be found. I called and asked that he call her to trouble shoot the thing. No, we can't do that; it's against policy. If she wants help over the phone it is another bill. I asked for a new computer; It's against our policy. We can't do that. Brand new computer that is not functioning the way it should. $800 for a brand new computer that does not work effectively. No cooperation from BB's Geek Squad.  Denise of Sacramento, CA     8/26/08  07/26/08, I took my computer to Best's Buy's Geek Squad to have repaired due to it randomly shutting down. I gave specific details (shuts down while on internet and when disc is running in the CD ROM) on what the problem was and when it occurs. I paid $69.99 to have a dianogstics test performed. I received a call stating that the trouble with my computer was due to viruses and to have the promblem resolved it will cost me $129, I agreed.  07/31/08, I went to pick up my computer and paid the $129 for the repairs. 08/02/08, I returned with my computer due to it shutting down, which is why I brought it to the Geek Squad initially. After the supposely repair (more virues removed), I went to pick up my computer, took it home just to have it shut down again.  08/17/08, I brought my computer back for the 3rd time for the same problem. 08/21/08, I call the Geek Squad in reference to my computer. I was told that they finally found the problem but it will cost me an additional $150 to have my power supply replaced. I spoke to a very RUDE store manager name Darrell, who basically told me in so many words, that I will have to pay for all of the service to my computer wether it was a fix or not or wether I requested it or not. I spoke with Best Buy's complaint department (Frank) and was offered a $50 gift card.  I've spent $200 for a dianogstic and viruses removed when after a 3rd visit the Geek Squad dianosed it is my power supply that needs to be replaced, I've driven approximately 10 miles back and forth 5 times, and my computer is still not repaired. Why should I pay Best Buy an additional $150 due to thier lack of? I had intention of not spending no more than $200 to have my computer repaired. If I was told initially that I will have to pay $129 for virus removal & $150 for a new power supply after paying the dianogstic fee ,$79.99, I would have not agreed to any further service and purchased another computer. If, I was told initially that it was the power supply, I would have agreed and maybe? only made 1 trip and not 5. This is now becoming very stressful and a finance burden, especially with the price of gas and I may not be able to apply for my on-line courses. Alvin of Chicago, IL     8/21/08  On 8/2/08, my daughter dropped off her computer for extended warranty repair which we purchased when we purchased the computer. She was told that it would have to be sent to the repair center and would take 2 weeks for it to be returned. She asked if the data on the hard drive would be lost and they informed her that they could not guarantee it but they could back it for $100. She borrowed the money to have the data backed up and was told it would take 24 hours for it to be ready. It took 6 days for the data to be ready to be picked after my daughter checked on it several times. When she inquired why it took so long, they would not/could not give her an answer. Since it took 6 days to back up the data, which meant it wasnt sent off to the repair center for 6 days.  On 8/15/08, I went with my daughter to check on the status of the computer. We asked the customer service rep if her computer was ready, he told us no. We asked when it would be ready, he said he did not know and could not tell us. I asked to talk to a manager at that point, 10:15AM, and was told none was available, that they were in a meeting. I left my cell phone number with the customer service rep and asked him to have the manager call me. The manager never did call me.  I called the store that night and asked to speak with a store manager and was told that there was no store manager present at this time, approximately 7PM. I asked to speak to any manager present. When a manager answered the phone, I explained to him everything that had happened and the poor service my daughter had received and expressed my anger. He put a geek squad member on the phone to tell me the computer was fixed and ready to ship back to the store. He then hung up the phone.  I called back to the store and requested to speak to the manager again, I told him I wanted my daughters money refunded for the poor service she received. I was told by the manager that he would not refund her money and that I could talk to a store manager, Charles, which magically appeared at the store. He told me the same thing and told me it only took 3 days to download her data.  My daughter received her computer on 8/20/08 with scratches all over the cover of the computer. She was so happy to get her computer back and get out of Best Buy; she left without even complaining about it, which would not do her any good anyway! I have spent well over $6,000 at this store in the past 2 years. If this is what Best Buy considers customer service, I have spent the last penny in any Best Buy store. This is one of the worst examples of customer care and customer service I have ever witnessed.  Lester of Hamilton, OH     8/21/08  On 8/12/08 the red Lamp light came on my Sony LCD TV. I had purchased the TV from Best Buy in Lacey Washington and had purchased the extended warranty for the TV. When the light came on we looked up the number to call for service and talked to someone in their service department. The man there told me that he would have a repair person come to my home and put in a new lamp. I asked him if I could pick up the lamp and put it in myself as the procedure is detailed in the manual and seems straight forward. The Best Buy person told me that NO the local store would not have a lamp and he would order one and have the repair man come by on Thursday 8/14/08.  A repair person from Geek Squad came to my home to diagnose the problem. We knew what the problem was, just a simple lamp replacement. He said he was not told what the problem was and did not have a lamp. Evidently the Bust Buy person was incompetent and did not do his job, or just plain told me a bold faced lie. The Geek Squad person did pull the bulb out and looked at it and said yup the lamp is broken. He said we dont have one, but I will overnight one and you should have it tomorrow. Oh and buy the way, I may not be able to get back to you for a few days so do you mind putting in the lamp? I thought that was poor service but agreed.  Well Friday came and went, no lamp, no lamp on Saturday either. Of course there was no lamp on Sunday so we waited Monday. Still no lamp. I called Bust Buy service and after being transferred to Keith, to his supervisor Karen, who told me there was not record of my problem. I gave her a complete detail of the history of the problem which I had already done with Keith. She seemed to not believe me. I quoted all information that the Geek Squad guy left me on the work order. She even asked me what the truck number was on the vehicle he used. Do I have to record things like that? Anyway they tried to transfer me to Geek Squad but lost me. I had to do it all over again including listening to the music for about 15 minutes. I went over the problem completely again to first a call taker then to another supervisor. They again transferred me to Geek Squad. I had to tell the same story to the guy there. As we were talking I heard a click and the phone went dead. I called again and got a different person at Geek Squad who I had to go over the problem again. He just hung up on me. I was not rude or abusive in anyway. I then got into my car and went to the Lacey Best Buy store.  I asked to talk to the store manager. They gave me a person by the name of Dennis. The employees used some kind of other name for the manager and I am not sure he was, but he said he was and I asked him to take me to his office. He said he did not have an office. He corrects and talks about employees performance in the middle of the store, He promised me he would call me at home during that evening. At about 7PM he called and said I am sorry but we can not order a new lamp until 8/25/08. And then it would be up to 10 days before the lamp would get here. I could not believe what he was saying. I had looked on the Internet and there were numerous places that had the lamp in stock. I could have one overnighted to me.  I told him to refund my money and I would get one myself which I did with no problems at all. To me Geek Squad is just a bunch of kids with their first job and have very little experience. I fixed a computer for a friend who had not been able to have the Geek Squad fix their computer. The heat sink on the processor had come lose and the CPU was over heating. I asked the Geek Squad employee to get me a heat sink and they did not even know what it was. That is pretty basic.  When they can not perform they just bail our and give you what little funds you may have left in and extended warranty. There could not be a simpler support problem than replacing the lamp on a LCD TV. They could not even do that simple task for a loyal customer who had bought many products from them over the years.  I replaced the lamp at my own expense. Larry of Lacey, WA     8/19/08  had computer serviced 3 times for the idetical item (mother board) each time picked up the computer returned it the next day. 2 week turn around each time.  Mark of Alliance, OH     8/16/08  I purchased a Sony home computer from Best Buy 1-27-08. I had to take it in for repair to Geek Squad 6-23. They said the hard drive was cracked and they would need to ship it to Sony as it was still under factory warranty. 7-30-08 I contacted Best Buy and Geek Squad via email and phone and told them if they could not repair my computer in a timely matter they should replace it. I was put on hold,ignored countless times so I contacted the BBB and my Attorney General.  Mean while I get a phone call from Best Buy corp. The customer service rep. Mike tells me that Geek Squad has finally received my computer back from Sony but without an operating system. I called Sony to request the recovery discs and the Sony rep. asks me for the original work order number they gave Geek Squad before shipping it to them.8-13 I talked to a Geek Squad rep. and asked him for that number and he told me that there wasn't a sony work order because they had done the repair. I have a recording of Mike, the Best Buy customer service rep. stating very clearly to me that geek squad could not touch my computer as it was still under factory warranty and if they were to repair my computer it would void the factory warranty.  I have now asked for a complete refund $1,413.86. As I have lost my year factory warranty, was lied to countless times by several of their employees. I purchased a 3 year warranty, which would mean I would have to deal with these unscrupulous people for that amount of time. I want nothing more to do with Best Buy or Geek Squad as their business practices are shoddy at best. I told Mike exactly that last night when he offered me a $200,00 gift certificate that I flatly refused. Jayna of Grove City, OH     8/14/08  3 yrs ago I purchased several appliances from Best Buy one of them was a Samsung refridgerator. About 3 weeks ago the evap system started to freeze over. I did not purchase the extended warranty on the items so I called best buy for service understanding I would have to pay for service. I told them about the problem. They gave me a date they would be out. I had to keep defrosting the evap system with a hair dryer every other day for two weeks. I told the people at the time I called for service that it would not defrost the evap coils.  Service day came the guy shows up I told him the defrost heater is not coming on. He looked in the freezer, no trouble shooting, and tells me the defrost the defrost heater is not coming on however he does not have parts. The trip charge for today is $100. Now we have to wait for the part. Which by the way we have to pay for the whole evap coil unit even though all we need is the heater which is a seperate unit from the evap coil. He is going to remove the heater from the new evap coil and install it and let me keep the new evap coil if I want it.  The evap coil being the major assembly in the freezer and the major part of the cost and I don't even need it. He also made a derogatory comment to my wife and myself about us beign COD customers like we were some kind of not to be trusted low life because we did not buy an extended warranty. I have purchased many things from Best Buy---Never will darken their doorway again. Lost a freezer full of meat and other foods. Will have to pay for parts I don't even need. Daniel of Plano, TX     7/31/08  My emachine computor has been into the Geek Squad 4 time this year and the mother board replaced 3 times! This computor was one year old in Jan.'08. The service has been very slow and I feel the computor is a lemon.  The downtime of this computor has affected my job search, and a computor class I have been trying to take online. Besides the inconvenience and cost of gasoline back and forth to BestBuy. I cannot even be contacted by email at this time since my computor has not yet been returned. K. of Portage, IN     7/29/08  My computer had a virus, therefore I took it to best buy. Immediately they looked into everything first before trying to remove the virus. They said I needed more memory, which I had already had installed. When I didn't want to upgrade, suddenly they couldn't clear the virus until they added more memory. They were to have the work done in 2 days, however they kept my computer for 12 days and it was returned to me still with a virus, slowere, desktop disabled, etc. I ended up paying $293.00 with no improvements.  I then check out complaints filed against them and I found several people all over the United states have received the same problems, treatment, high charges. I believe their practice is to charge as much as possible for their service, do as little as possible, not stand behind their products, they refuse to call, return calls, and/or answer calls. I'm looking to have my money refuned since I have to put the computer back into the shop. Thank you Slower system, loss of use for several days, still have a virus, desktop disabled. Rita of Fort Wayne, IN     7/28/08  The cd rom drive on my pc quit working i called best buy geek squad and asked how much to look at it and told them what was wrong with my pc and she keep saying bring it in they will give you an estimate for free.I made my husband take me to best buy which is across town when i got there and waited in line for an hour they said it will cost 69.95 to give me a estimate. The manager keep saying it was a miss communication and there was nothing she could do.Then the manager says my computer would still be under warranty but i had my phone number changed shortly after i got my pc over a year ago so i could not remember my old number she could not find my warranty info on my pc.I then asked for a number to complain all she could say 1-800-best buy and walked away. The fun part having to listen to my husband yell at me for dragging him out and wasting gas for nothing plus tearing my pc down and taking it to best buy made me fear that all the carrying it and the ride will further break it Linda of Saint Petersburg, FL     7/23/08  I purchased a laptop computer from Best Buy location in Albuquerque, NM. Best Buy people at Albuquerque did not tell me about the functionality check, which they perform for electronic products like computers, etc. before selling it. I took the packaged good and went to my place. It was around 11.00 pm when I reached home, so the Best Buy was closed. When I opened the package, I found that at least Operating System (OS)Re-installation Disc was missing; initially I thought that they don't provide it. Then I turned on the computer and found that the OS was not loading (it showed 'blue screen').  I had a flight next day to Baltimore. The product comes with 1 year manufacturers warranty; however, if there's any problem with the product I am required to see Best Buy as their tech support is recognized by the manufacturer. I can go to any Best Buy location (that was the reason in the first place that I bought it from Albuquerque). So when I reached Baltimore, I went to the Best Buy store near Inner Harbor. The tech support people were very inefficient and did not take any responsibility for the malfunctioning of the product. Initially they said that I can exchange it for another model (apparently, they did not have the same model in-store and also couldn't order from nearby store; they only had one for display for anyone to use and experience the product) or I can get the money back.  I spent the whole day there, but after wards they told me that if I exchange/return it, they will charge 15% restocking fee. The manager initially said that 15% may not be applicable for 'blue screen' problem, but later he didn't respond as well. Afterwards, I said that if they can make it functional I'll just take it. So they gave me a service receipt and took my computer for the night, saying they will install OS and drivers and asked me to come next day at 10.30 am. I reached there at Best Buy, at 1.00 pm I had my doctor's appointment. When I went there, one person told me it'll take 10 min. The after wards it became 2 hrs or so. I went back but was late for the doctor's appointment.  When I returned at 3 pm or so, I was told that my computer is crashed. But 10 min later another person told me it's perfectly fine and working. He showed me the computer, but I could see that it was not the one I purchased (it was the same model though). I pointed out a defect; the component near the screen was loose and deformed slightly. But there attitude was not good and told me that it's the one that I purchased and they are not responsible for any damage. Later I found that the computer has a different service tag no. than the one I bought.  I contacted the manufacturer and found that it's a different computer which was surprising because they didn't have any for sale, except the old demo computer. I tried calling the consumer relation at best buy, but I usually get the voice messaging system. They haven't contacted me yet for 2 days. Best Buy in Baltimore gave me another computer which is defected and told me its the same one. Please let me know what can I do in this case. I can provide more details about the product, my dealings with these people, warranty, etc. Thank you very much Cost of the product is 1066. Lot of mental tension, time loss and work loss. Bhasker of Baltimore, MD     7/18/08  I spent $1100.00 for a Dell Computer at the Best Buy in Millville, New Jersey. I'm not very computer savvy so I had some questions about connecting to the internet and such. Further, it appears that the new Windows Vista was not allowing me to log on to my AOL Instant Messenger program and was freezing on videos on youtube.com.  Naturally, I called Dell Computer. I was told by their customer service rep that Dell could not help me because they had a contract with Best Buy. So he suggested I speak to someone on Best Buy's Geek Squad about my problems. So I called Best Buy's number and was eventually connected to a Geek Squad specialist. When I told her my problems she said that she could help me but I had to pay $29.00. I told her that I just bought the computer and she said that it didn't matter, I still had to pay $29.00.  You know, when I bought a Dell laptop at Circuit City a few months ago, I was able to talk to a Dell computer specialist for free. Best Buy's customer service [is bad]. Reggie of Millville, NJ     7/16/08  Took my Gateway model 7330GZ laptop in for repairs under my extended Warranty/service Plan which is valid until early August 2008. The laptop has developed a cracked/broken hinge, which has spread over the past several weeks (similar to how a windshield crack may spread over time but on a different scale). After about a week and a half I got phone call from Best Buy Geek Squad saying that my computer was ready but my request to repair/replace the parts necessary to fix the hinge was denied.  I had a conversation with the Geek Squad employee about how I was mislead that the extended warranty was supposed to cover all things no questions asked and that I could even get Free battery replacement if there was any doubt that the factory battery was flawed....in other words, deception at the time of purchase by the sales agent. At any rate I went to the store to pick up my computer and/or confront the staff about their deception and failure to honor the service plan they sold me..a 3-yr plan. The continuous replies I got from Geek Squad Staff and Mr Addison is that my unit only has cosmetic damage and therefore does not affect the operation of the computer.  I took my copy of the svc. agreement to the store show the staff I should be covered according to the service plan regardless of the deceptive sales tactics used when I purchased the unit and here's why... The particular model computer I bought and several other models built with the same or similar chassis is nortoriously known to have a manufacturer defect in the construction/design of the hinges...they crack, break, etc and it is well documented. It plainly says ton the Extended warranty that Manufacturers Defects are covered under the warranty... In another section of the warranty it states that cosmetic damage is not covered under the warranty, nut it does not state anything about this condition overruling the condition about manufacturer defect coverage inclusive.  Also, the Geek Squad staff and Mr. Addison stated that my cracked hinge (which will eventually cause the lid and screen to detatch itself from the base) did not affect performance of the OC and was considered cosmetic damage.... Well, Cosmetic damage to Mr Addison is like a scratch on a new car...My scenerio is more like a hinge/fitting on my hood that is cracked and about to break, leaving my hood in jeopardy of becoming detached and possibly ajar in the near future. As of right now, I have to gingerly raise and lower the hinged screen because I don't want the crack to spread any bigger....so the manner by which I'm handling my computer is a mechanical aspect of it's performance, and has been compromised doe to the manufacturer defect. It is very obvious that Best Buy is trying to wiggle their way out of their obligation, and also that the sales of the extended warranty at purchase was a true act of deception in itself. I probably won't be buying anything at best buy anytime soon.  I was led to believe and Deceived that the extended warranty/svc/ plan would cover anything that happened to that laptop, even if I simply dropped it on the floor and it burst into a thousand pieces. The extended warranty terms and conditions are no where near the bumper to bumper-like protection that the salesperson indicated, but nonetheless there is a clause in the protection plan that should have covered me anyway, and Best Buy will not honor it. They have lied and are now trying to cheat me.  Damaged Hinge ~199.00 sale of the 3 year extended warranty $949.00 Replacement cost of the computer of they are unable or refuse to fix the one that I purchased $20 for expenses incurred for any additional trips to Best Buy to attempt to remedy the situation Gene of Clayton, NC     7/15/08  My teenage son took his laptop into Best Buy for a technician to look at it because his video card wasn't working. The technician told him he needed a new vidio card and picked one out for him. He called me to get approval and charged the new video card to my MasterCard. When he got home, we immediately opened the shrink wrapped box with the video card and in it was a 3.5 floppy. No video card!  He immediately took it back and they refused to give him a new one because they told him the box was shrinkwrapped. This is true, but we are not crooks and did not switch anything in that box. The floppy drive looked brand new and was all wrapped up, so I don't know if it was a mistake at the factory or something eles is going on in their warehouse. I do know they have shrink wrap machines and can rewrap anything. I am out $151.54 dollars if MasterCard will not stand up for me in this dispute. Judging from the number of Best Buy complaints on the internet, these people are definitely lacking morals and must need to do this to make a profit. Kathy of Sugar Land, TX     7/7/08  My daughters bought a Fuji digital camera on sale at Best Buy Jan 07 for 159.99 plus we purchased a $30.00 2 yr extended warranty for it. For whatever reason the camera stopped functioning after 5 months sowe took into Best Buy to honor their warranty and the infamous Geek Squad took the camera and sent it out for repair. one and a half months later and several phone calls to the Geek Squad they stated, it's going to cost more to repair it so just go into the Best Buy store and they will replace the camera with the same or better camera.  My wife, daughters and I went to the store yesterday and the service counter tries to pawn off a camera that A): $30.00 less and B): had less features and zoom capability. My wife and 14 yr daughter said, no way that is totally unexceptable, so customer service rep goes into the back to talk to service manager then returns and says we will give you store credit for 159.99. I tell the rep that I would rather have my money back since you can't honor your warranty. At that point the service manager goes out after he hears my wife and I repeat our request for our money back. The service rep explains that the the only camera comparable to the one my daughters bought cost $180.00 so we would have to pay out of our pocket another $20.00. This is when I starrted to heat up a little and demanded my money back.  The Service manager then tries to rectify the issue. So I repeat to the manager that I'm not paying an additional $20.00 for a camera when your Geek Squad and my warranty state different so give me my money back and I'll take my buisness else where. The service manager then states, I need to know who I'm talking with you or youe wife because I feel like I'm in stero surround sound. I tell him your talking to me and don't be smart with me and give me my money back. Then he gives me the whole ordeal againg about we would get store credit and have to pay the additional cost for the new camera and another $30.00 service warranty for that camera.  At that point I told him to refund my cash again. At that point the service manager ask me to leave his store, which I complied with because my blood was starting to boil dealing with idiots refusing to give my money back. After waiting for about 45 minutes, my wife and daughters finally emerged from the store. They store got permission to give my daughters the $180.00 which was the only camera in comparison and they carried over the original service plan from the first camera to the new replacement.  If my wife and I wouldn't of been persistent in making them honor their warranty and also what they told us on the phone, Best Buy would have screwed another consumer out of $20-50 dollars. If you ask me, Best Buy has a pretty good scam going on: tell the consumer it can't be fixed and that your product is no longer being made but the next one in comparison is this product which cost more so we will store credit you and you make up the difference plus anthor warranty on that product.  As for me, I will never give Best Buy my buisness again and have told all my neighbors, family and friends to stay away from Best Buy. Roger of 323 Deep River Rd,, SC     7/3/08  I am writing as I am at my wits end with Best Buy. I purchased a television from them over a year ago. Along with a service protection plan. My TV broke down over 2 weeks ago ( 6/408 ) and we were told by the repair man who was here for about 5 min that he had never seen that before tried calling several people no one answered their phones and he left stating that it could be a month or so he guessed and wasn't even sure that the part he was ordering was the right one.  So now to Best Buy, we have since been in contact with them, we have been told on several occasions that if our TV was not fixed in 14 days that we would be issued a voucher to go back to Best Buy and pick out a new TV of equal or lesser value. ( emails and a voice mail to back this up ) So tomorrow is day 14 no part to fix the TV. my husband called to get an answer out of them as this has been going on for several weeks that we have had no TV. He was told today that it is now up to 45 days for a resolution and that if we don't like it we can cancel out service plan and get the TV repaired at our cost.  Apparently they have the right at anytime to basically not stand behind their warranty and tell you to just take it. Basically they have written a warranty that they can take their sweet time and when they feel like getting to it they will, there is no cap on time you must be without. Just a we will fix it and you don't have to pay for it, but we will get to it. We have made several attempts to resolve this in a timely and professional manner, and yet we get told no when asked to speak with a supervisor etc. ( 7/1/08 )  So it has been a month and still no repair and no new tv as promised by several people. the tv repair people came out with the wrong part and has subsequently ordered this new part but it is not ordered it is in research status now. so they keep denying our claim for a replacement, but they keep changing the policy, to fit them not the consumer. if i would have known what i was in for with this company and their supposed svc protection plan i would have walked out of the store. We have been without a tv for a month still paying a cable bill, and phone bill calling minnesota to talk to this seng person and such and about a total of 5 minutes of time wasted for the first time visit of technician but waited at home all day for the guy to show up and then the second visit with the wrong part to another tv wasted at home all day and he was here for not even and hour this time. but atleast he brough tools this time and had a clue as to why he was here although not a clue how to fix it. Anne of Bristol, CT     7/2/08  Purchase an inspiron from best buy. I told at time of purchase that not only did I have a 1 year dell warranty I also had a queek squad service. Well when four months later the cd drive went the run around started.... The Dell website says All Dell products sold at Best Buy come with a 1-year limited warranty. When I enter my service code into the dell website, it says I have 209 days left on next day shipping of all parts. HOWEVER, either best buy, geek squad or dell will send me a replacement part!  Dell tech support referred me to best buy. Best buy referred me to geek squad. Geek squad told me I had to bring the machine into best buy. I brought the machine into best buy spent 45 min waiting in best buy and was finally told geek squad that I had to leave my computer with them so they could send it to KY for repair. I would be without my computer for 3 weeks! I use my computer daily and can't be without it. The machine works perfectly it's just the cd. I asked them to order the part & I would bring my machine back into best buy to replace it. No, they had to send the machine to KY. I ask them to send the part to me & I would replace it. No, they couldn't do that because they couldn't guarentee my quality of work.  I then spoke to the best buy manager. I said if that if I had to be with my computer for 3 weeks, then best buy should give me a loaner computer. No, that she couldn't authorize. Send the machine to KY or nothing. I then came home & called dell. After all it's a dell and it is only 4 months old. I asked dell to send me the part. They said because I bought it at best buy I had to call best buy, they couldn't speak to me. I went though everything that had happened at best buy. The non-native speaking english person just keep reading the same line of the script. I had to call best buy...I called best AGAIN, they told me to call geek squad. I called geek squad AGAIN and guess what geek squad told me this time? I could either bring it back to best buy to send to KY or, I could purchase a cd drive and they (geek squad) could come to my house to install it; for a charge.  That sounds like a ZERO warrenty to me.... I have purchase a comination of 10 optiplexs & latitudes from dell for my company (self owned) in the past 8 years. I find it absoluetly outrages that I can not get service for this dell nor can I get a stupid $20.00 part sent to me for me to replace myself! Do I have any recourse? I'll buy the dumb part, it's the principal. Just aggrevation & stress. Lisa of Chappaqua, NY     6/28/08  A Panasonic Camera DMC-TZ1, purchased 06-03-06, took about 150 pictures with it. Camera and all accessories cost $581.+ Around February 2008, the camera would not turn ON. Finally, on 04/05/08, after contacting Best Buy who refused to accept the camera if I sent it Parcel Post, insured and signature requested, that I was willing to pay for that service both ways...I had to drive 150 miles round trip twice.That cost an extra $105.00 in fuel, totally using up the $60.00 4 year service contract.  After about 3 weeks I was called to P.U my camera. Came home, placed the fully charged battery in, still would not go ON! Called them again, same scenario experienced, The clerk was beligerent, insulting, insisting I needed to personally deliver it, discusted I hung up. Called Panasonic in Chicago,was instructed to send it to them. I wrote a complete explanation of experiences with Best Buy, and sent letter and mailed, insured, signature requested. After 3 weeks and more repeticious explanation, 3 different quotes were made to repair it, all over $126.00 I finally told them to ship it back un-repaired. This WHITE ELEPHANT has cost enough. Panasonic was asked to intercede with Best Buy, the subject was ignored. I think that a climatic Class action suit needs to be filed and persued vigorously by an aggressive law firm to resolve and set Best Buy straight or take them out of business. The officials also need to be held accountable and sentenced severely for fraudulent behavior,etc. I will not patronize Best Buy nor purchase another Panasonic product ever. I have spent at least 100 hours so far, investigating this issue, my costs of the camera, and traveling expenses, surely my time has value, plus the inconveniences of NO camera. Any future contacts will all be in writing, forming a paper trail with these characters. Jude of Crossville, TN     6/25/08  I am receiving very poor service from this Geek Squad location. I have bought three computers from best buy. I just wish there was service to go with it.  All I wanted done was a data transfer. After loosing my computer and having it under another person phone number. They give it back to me saying they could not do the work. I get it home. I find that the operating system is gone and I am unable to access my files. I took it back and I am unable to get a response from Geek Squad.  Wesley of Texarkana, TX     6/23/08  On Tuesday at 5pm I dropped off my car for installation. The speakers cost about $106 and the installation fees were $85. At 10 pm I left the store with my driver side window unable to close, speakers were not working the radio did not work and my remote entry was flawless. All of these things worked at 5pm per installation pre-check. Jonathan the installer told me to bring it back the next day and if the systems aren't working they (BB) would have it towed and pay to get it fixed. He indicated there was absolutely no liability on my part.  The next day I brought the car back at 10 am. On a rainy Wednesday at 11:40 Bernie said take your car to the dealership to get it looked at and if its our fault we will pay for it. So I took my car to Jim Ellis. After 2 hours I was told that the rear speaker started a chain reaction and a switch went out etc. Two hundred, fifty seven dollars later and the next morning I picked up the car at the dealership. That Thursday morning we spoke with Colson and left him with estimate/diagnostic information and he said his installation team would take a look at it. Later we spoke to Joshua. He indicated that the window motor was unplugged and that the window now worked. The dealership told me not to plug in the motor in fears that a switch would be blown again. The dealership reset the codes which apparently fixed the radio and speaker system. The keyless entry system still acts funny.  So Thursday 2 days after the installation was complete my car appeared to be back to the way it was when I left it there for speakers. Joshua offered half the dealer's fee, we did not feel that was adequate and he said he would call us back within 24 hours. He never called. We called him Friday at 4pm, Friday night and Monday and all he left was a message today around noon saying that he had not talked with dealership.  All we are asking for is that Best Buy stand behind their installation guarantee and promises. The problem took me personally 10 hours of my time to resolve so we gracefully request that you refund the installation charge as well. The email below is what occured to me almost a month when i went to Best Buy to get speakers installed. The Diagnostic charge was $257 and Best Buy only refunded half of the charge because it could not be proven that it was there fault, but they still could not get my window up, only VW could. I think that if they could not get my window up and I had to take it elsewhere, Best Buy should have to pay? Am I correct? Well they said no and that I got ripped off. I was patient with them and kind but I believe that Best Buy took advantage of me.  Now recently my air condition stopped working a couple of weeks ago, A mechanic said it needed new relays under dash which is where Best Buy did some work. I called Best Buy, they said again let us look and if its our fault, we will pay for it. But they never admitted any wrongdoing before yet everything worked before I went in, but not after I left. They also said that it to dealership get a diagnostic again and if its our fault we will pay for it. I lost $125 for the installation charge, air conditioner, and would also like installation charge Chris of Lawrencville, GA     6/9/08  Representative for Geeksquad services Client not happy with the service that she received. Geeksquad installed Norton on to her computer and now computer is not working. Says she has been given the run around about her problems with the computer. Says that she wants a refund . Geeksquad assured her that they would fix her computer and she is very upset because even after her computer messed up she bought multiple applications to help fix the computer but her computer still is not working.  On the 11th she set up new password so that she can do a system restore and the computer shut her out. Computer wont let her go to safemode at all. Contacted a Double Agent and they tried to troubleshoot her through safe mode and it still didnt work. Agent in store downloaded a whole bunch of updates and computer completely shut down. Getting error messages contact application manager. She has taken 4 round trips in one week. Client is very upset and definately wants her money back. Client stated that the Geeksquad Double Agents were very rude to her and she is very upset because she states she is a loyal customer with Best Buy. Everytime she took her computer in to best buy to have her computer repaired Best buy and Geeksquad representatives were VERY RUDE.  Cj of Marina Del Ray, CA     5/16/08  I purchased a home theater system, full-motion wall mount for my 46 flatscreen & installation service for mounting the flatscreen & home theater. I was assured by the sales rep that the 2 installation services purchased would cover the cost of mounting the flatscreen & concealing all wires. I read the terms & agreement and once again further clarified with the sales rep that the installation costs included concealment of all wires; he replied it did. In fact, he provided his email address & cell phone number in the event of a problem during installation I took the day off from work so that I was present for the installation which was to occur between 8am - 12pm. The technicians arrived at 12:15pm and immediately let me know that in order to conceal all the wires for the installation and mount the speakers for my home theater it would be an additional ~$200-$300. In fact, the current installation services that I purchased only covered the the mounting of the flatscreen, connecting the flatscreen/home theater and clearly exposing all wires.  I was pretty displeased with news and explained that my one expectation was that the wires would be concealed during installation and when I repeatedly asked the sales rep, he repeatedly assured me that it was included. I was more than willing to pay extra at the time of my original purchase to ensure that the installation was clean/concealed but for this to occur during the day of installation was a complete lost of trust and feel that I'm incurring fairly steep hidden costs. To the credit of one of the Geek Squad techs, he was apologetic about the misunderstanding and attempted to explain the reasoning behind the additional costs. He went a step further and called the Best Buys store and talked with the manager of the Magnolia Home Theater and General Store. The MHT manager stated he would credit my account 1/2 the cost of the wall mount system, which was a reasonable attempt to correct the situation. Unfortunately, the 2nd tech kept quoting prices in generalities and it was until I requested a written estimate of the costs that I was informed that it would cost an additional ~$600.  At this point it was nearly 2pm and I was still without my original request. At this point, I opted to continue with just the basic wall mounting, returning the home theater installation + home theater system + brackets. Unfortunately, there were some structural issues with my home/studs and I was forced to return the original mounting system for a larger one. Once at the original BB store, the customer service desk was abhorent. The MHT manager who offered to reduce the wall mount cost had departed for the day but assured me on the phone earlier that he would explain my situation to the next manager. This manager was present and his attitude was suspicious and extremely reluctant to accept any of the merchandise for return. It should be noted that all merchandise was in it's original packaging and with the exception of the wall mounting system, unopened. This manager then called a second manager who was even more unfriendly and uncooperative. At one point, I felt lucky to receive my money back...forget about trying to seek some sort of compensation for the hassle of dealing with all this.  Needless to say, I purchased a less expensive wall mounting system and the credit I was afforded earlier in the day was quickly rescinded and I would receive no credit since I was making a smaller purchase; in addition to returning my home theater system. The one silver lining to this whole experience are the efforts of one of the Geek Squad technicians who called me back later in the day to follow up on the situation. This tech explained that they were at a second job and would be unable to return to mount the system as he had explained they might be able to earlier. I explained that I had already rescheduled the install and was hoping he, specifically, would return to install. He explained that he would not be able to since he was merely filling in for another tech and was assigned as a district manager or in the district office. My only hope is that this tech/manager influences his office and other techs to apply solid customer relations, professionalism and genuine empathy in future installs...without him, I'd likely never to have continued with this BB purchase. As it stands now, I'm not likely to return to BB nor recommend this store to others. Jason of Alexandria, VA     4/15/08  Our company bought a Laptop 8/22/07 from the Best Buy in Minnetonka, MN, for one of our work stations. We called Best buy 5 days later and said the laptop will not turn on--it takes about 5-7 tries to get this turned on. They (GeekSquad) said to bring it in and they would look at it, so we did. It worked for about two weeks and had the same problem. We brought it back to the store, and they sent it off to another state to be fixed. Picked up the Laptop on the day they said he would be there, came back to the office and guess what? It still does not work. I called Best Buy and asked why they let me out of the store and did NOT tell me it still did not work. NO answer to the questions; they said it would have to go back to HP. Just to let you know--we DID buy the extended warranty for $230.00 for five years. No one will call me back and let me know what to do.... I called the Customer Relation department and spoke with Beth, and she could not help me, either. She said I need to speak with someone at the store. I was on hold for 17 minutes for nothing.... Sandy of Plymouth, MN     3/14/08  On a Wednesday evening a sales person told me that an XM radio for my vehicle would cost $149. Upon arriving at the store, she told me that if I wanted clear reception, I would have to buy another antenna for $19. On Wednesday, I was told that it would take about an hour or an hour and a half to install it. Thursday, after purchasing the XM, she told me drive up to the installation bay, and the tech would come out and and get the keys. I drove up to the bay, and the young man just stood there and stared at me. Then another customer walked in, and the tech waited on them. I then got out of the car and approached the tech, and he told me it would be several hours to install the XM. I complained inside the store, and the people just looked at me. I then got my money back and went to Mother's Window Tint and got an XM and installation. Bait advertising--and a sorry way to run a railroad. I'm very upset! Randy of Bastrop, TX     3/8/08  I have been unable to use my printer attached to my Compac PC or my Flash Drive. I signed up for online help through The Geek Squad's online service for $129.00 . The first representative spend 4 hours running virus scans and told me to call back when they were complete. I called back and spent another 3 hours with a different rep who wanted to rerun the virus scan; she disconnected from my computer mid virus scan. I called back and got a different service rep, who was so bad I requested to speak with a Supervisor. He hung up on me. I called a fourth time and spent another 2 hours with a representative who finally tried to fix my issue with the printer, which he was not able to correct. The process was horrible and time consuming, and my issue is STILL not corrected.  I spent $129.00 and 10 hours of my time, and I still do not have a resolution of my issue. I should least have written documentation on what was done to correct the problem so I can take that to a different professional. The first three reps wasted so much time on unnecessary virus scans and NO time on the actual issue. I should not have to call back in a get a different rep every time, there is no way to reconnect with the person you were previously speaking with. No Supervisor's were available to speak with at anytime. A complete waste of time and money. I think the Geek Squad's online service is a scam! Vicki of Diamond Springs, CA     2/20/08  Dropped off my laptop on 01-31-2008 at the Albany, NY Best Buy store, specifically at the Geek Squad, concerning an issue with the DVD drive - does not play DVDs. This is an expensive laptop with an extended warranty. This is my 3rd laptop with Best Buy & dealing with their Geek Squad - never had any reportable issues with them prior to this debacle. I was advised that the estimated completion date = 02-08-2008 (printed on my receipt). Now I understand that this is an estimate, no issue here.  Best Buy was to call me in a few days after 01-31-2008 to verify what exactly the issue is & to give me an updated completion date. Never received a call, so I called Best Buy on 02-10-2008 & was advised that they have not looked at my laptop yet. I wrote an email to Best Buy consumer affairs office and was basically told that the Albany store was evaluating the laptop: no additional info, no updated completion date and of course to apology or concern, just a boilerplate response. I just called the store AGAIN, today 02-17-2008, and was advised that have yet to LOOK AT my laptop! So I get absolutely nowhere with calling the store. I get no assistance from Best Buy consumer relations. I am unable to use the internet (cable modem) at my home... wasting $44.95 per month + taxes, etc.  Robert of Guilderland, NY     2/17/08  On March 2, 2005, I purchased a Gateway laptop from Best Buy in West Hartford, CT. I also purchased the extended warranty at that time. The salesman told me it was considered multi-functional and that because dirt and dust could be so detrimental to the machine, I could send it off for an internal cleaning as often as once a month. On January 26, 2008, I took my laptop to the Geek Squad so they could repair the plug in for the AC adapter and do an internal cleaning. The Geek Agent Ed said that I could lose all my information when they worked on the computer, so I paid him $159 for him to backup my information. He said he would do it that evening and send the laptop out in the morning. When I called two days later to pick up my backup disks, I was informed that they had not performed the backup. I asked to speak to the manager, as I had paid for this service which had not been performed. The manager was not in the least bit helpful and did not want to refund my $159, but put me in touch with Agent Ryan. Agent Ryan informed me that he had contacted the service center in Kentucky, and he would have them do the backup prior to any work on my computer.  Next thing I know Agent Ryan is calling me, and the service center has fixed my laptop and it is on the way back. Did they back it up? No. I went to pick it up on 2/6/08, and this incredibly rude Geek Squad guy named Chris did not like the fact that I was unhappy about my information not being backed up. He wanted me to just take my computer and go away. I told him I thought it would be a good idea if I turned on my laptop to see if it even worked. Well wonder of wonders, it did not! My hard drive was missing. Chris snatched my receipt for the backup and left. Out comes Agent Ryan. They have found my hard drive and are backing it up. I said what is the point in that? Just put the hard drive back in the laptop, and I'll back it up for free at home. The hard drive gets put back in the laptop, and now it doesn't work. It's looping. It was working fine prior to going to Best Buy!  Agent Ryan now states that it could have happened at any time, but he will give me a new hard drive and load Windows. Now I notice that my battery is not in my laptop. Agent Ryan points out that on the paper I was given when I brought the laptop in it only listed my AC adapter under accessories. Well forgive me for not knowing that my battery should have been listed in the same area. No one informed me. Now my hard drive with all my pictures and information for the last three years are wrecked, and I can't retrieve anything; and my $300 battery is gone. As for the internal cleaning, the snit Chris presented me with a brochure on the extended warranty which stated that cleanings were not covered. I immediately flipped it over and pointed out to him that the brochure was revised in June of '05, and I purchased my computer in March of '05. I went home and found my brochure which stated that fax/multi-functional machines should be internally cleaned at least once a year. Well surprise, surprise, now Agent Ryan claims a laptop is not multi-functional, printers are. So besides my hard drive being wrecked and my battery missing, my laptop is filthy. Best Buy should be closed down. I have lost three years of information and pictures. I no longer have a battery for my laptop. Leslie of Canton, CT     2/12/08  Viper Remote Start was purchased as a Christmas gift. My son was advised ANY Best Buy would install it (paid extra for the installation), as it was being sent to his dad in South Jersey, 2 hours away. That is not the case. Best Buy in Cherry Hill, Mt. Laurel and Deptford would not install it because they did not accept the prepaid installation charge and advised me it had to be in-stalled at the BB where it was purchased or pay another installation fee. This is totally inappropriate, and my personal feeling is my son was lied to just to make a sale.  I am not driving 2 hours to return this item or have it installed, and I am not paying to have it returned by mail. BB would not pay for shipping to have the item returned. This is the worst business practice I have ever dealt with. And your attorney may contact me at any time. Marlene of Cherry Hill, NJ     2/2/08  I purchased a cutting edge dual core processor computer when they first came out in August 2005. It NEVER worked. I have taken it to there GEEK SQUAD over 18 times. They have been promising to replace it, but Corporate never approves it. I spend 4 hours at a time on this and over 150 hours to date. I spent over $2500 on this computer AND bought an extended service plan. What is their problem? How do we stand up against this gross negligence? AT this point they had the gall to tell me how old the computer is. I have not used this computer, NOT once since November 2006. It never worked.  I ate it for a computer that cost over $2500 and never worked. They have not replaced it two years later after sending it to corporate over 4 times and me submitting it to be repaired to their Geek squad over 18 times. Don't buy ANYTHING from Best Buy. Sandra of Sausalito, CA     2/1/08  On 12/28/2007 I took my personal desktop computer to Best Buy for repair under an extended warranty policy. I purchased this warranty policy when I purchased the PC new at Best Buy. The computer appeared to have caught on fire internally during normal use. The Geek Squad Agent removed the side panel to visually view the inside of the PC to confirm my complaint. Upon viewing the PC we found the Power Supply and Mother Board damaged along with the PC case black inside and on outside at cooling fan opening. I requested a credit to the store to purchase another PC through my extended warranty policy due to the extent of damage. The Geek Squad Agent along with Travis, one of the Managers in the store at that time, agreed that the PC was beyond repair but must follow procedure, and the PC must be sent out to their service center. They stated that I should receive a phone call from one of the Geek Squad Agents in a few days authorizing me to receive credit to purchase another PC through my extended warranty program. A service Order was written up with an Estimated Completion Date of 1/5/2008.  As of present time I still have not received authorization for store credit to purchase another PC nor have received my original PC back from the repair center. I have called the Best Buy Store a number of times to find out the status. I have been told that the PC is being repaired. I talked to Travis, and Steve, another store manager, with my concern of repairing a PC that caught on fire. I am concerned that it may happen again and also shocked that the PC is being repaired. Calling Best Buy at the number given to me on my service order has been an experience in itself. I have stayed on the phone for over 30 minutes during business hours waiting for them to just pick it up. I have spoken to Karim, Jen, Travis (Manager), Steve (Manager), Mathew, Soka (Sales Manager), and finally Brian (Manager) who I told that I was going to file a case with Consumer Affairs and who replied, OK. I called the Best Buy Customer Service Center at 1-888-237-8289 and spoke to Branden and Tom with my problem, case #44956483--which did not help at all, since to date I am still without a PC. I feel that if you put on a Service Order estimated Completion Date of 1/5/2008 that your PC should be completed within a few days of that time frame. I feel that the service I have received has been horrible and very unprofessional. I have purchased a TV, and recently a clothes Washer, and Microwave oven from this store in the past few months. At this time, I wish I had never purchased anything from this retail store.  Richard of Elk Grove, CA     1/22/08  I made an appointment for Sirius radio and new speakers to be installed in truck. George was rude from the first phone call. When I made the appointment I told him I am not knowledgeable whatsoever about this process and needed to be informed on everything I need. He asked me what kind of radio; I told him Sirius and he asked what kind of truck. He said nothing about needing an FM adapter. I had to wait 2 weeks for an appointment. On the morning of the appointment I called the store to confirm. He again asked me for information, and for the first time he asked if I had an FM Adapter. He very unfriendly-like said they are sold out of them, and I can pick one up at a store on way. There are no stores on way there, and I told him I was very upset that he did not tell me this before and at least hold one, knowing I made an appt. 2 weeks ago. George said a lot of people don't show up for appointments.  I told him I am not a lot of people; I was ready to have a system put in my car also and spend almost $1,000 there today; but his customer service skills are terrible, and he can forget me coming there ever! I called back 5 more times to complain to his boss, and each time George himself answered the phone and just laughed at me.  This upset me so much I have been severely stressed out, and my husband's vehicle still does not have this system installed properly. I will never shop at any Best Buys again and will tell family and friends to do the same. The Waldorf Best Buys has a history of poor customer service, and recently this same store appeared in local paper because an employee ripped off a customer.  Karen of Owings, MD     1/22/08  On November 24, 2007 I took my computer to Best Buy for a diagnosis on what was wrong with it. After four days I was called and told it was checked out, that the hard drive was dead, and I would need a new one. I was told it would cost approx $230 to replace and reprogram the new hard drive. The diagnostic was $60 for this information. I decided to get a second opinion since the computer was only 1.5 years old but nevertheless, out of the warranty period. I took my computer to a friend who repairs computers for the hospital where I have worked. He checked it out, removed a Virus from it and returned it to me working as good as new.  I contacted Best Buy's Geek Squad supervisor and told him what had occurred. His response was that although he was appalled that this had happened, there was nothing he could do about paying me back the money for the misdiagnosed computer. There was nothing he could do except offer his empathy. Frank of Shasta, CA     1/17/08  I purchased a new Gateway Desktop Serial Number CCH66-810-08133 in Oct. 06. In April or May 07, the video card went bad and was replaced with no problems at Best Buy in Lawrence, KS. Then in Aug. 07 the computer crashed. I returned it to Best Buy and was told it would need to be returned to the factory. This was done the first time early in Sept 07. About a month later it was returned to me and wasn't working correctly. So I called customer service and again returned it to the factory. The second time it was returned, the front of the computer was broken. So for the third time it was returned. This was in early Nov. 07. At that time I talked to a Supervisor named Bob, I believe. He was going to build a new upgraded computer with WXP, not Vista, and have it shipped to me ASAP. It's now almost the new year, and I still have no computer. I did call over 3 weeks ago and was told it was ready to be shipped, but on hold. I questioned why and didn't receive an answer. I have been without a computer for almost 6 months. I was concerned about buying a Gateway at the time of purchase and will never purchase another or recommend anyone else purchasing one. I have the Supervisors name and badge number, it's just not at my fingertips at the moment. Trying to run a home based business without my computer, losing all my documents and files related to the business, has been difficult if not almost impossible. I didn't have a complete backup. Carolyn of Baldwin City, KS     12/28/07  I have a problem with the vendor, the Geek Squad. The problem right now is that they sent someone to my home and the person caused a problem with the sound portion of the computer. We do not have any sound. Brad came to our home on a Sunday and then we had a problem on Monday and he came on Wednesday and we now have no sound. I spoke with Michael from the Geek Squad who is Bryan's boss. He wants to charge us again to have someone come out.  I will not shop at this stores. I have purchased computer, TV, washer/dryer, CD, DVD, IPODs etc. from this store. I want help in resolving this problem now. I feel very frustrated and angry at the lack of help and understanding. I have been told that their company can't do anything to help, but they are in the stores and when you purchase a computer from Best Buy, they are the ones who hook it up. Therefore Best Buy should be able to help. Patricia of Toms River, NJ     12/11/07  I went into the Best Buy store because my daughter's computer was not working properly. I told the Geek Squad Agent the problem, and he insisted that it was a computer virus. He charged $299.00 plus installation of a virus program, $89.00. They called one week later telling me the computer was working. I came in and had them test it in front of me. Well, it was still not working, but the installation technician quite adamantly stated that he had done all the work, minus the installation because I did not give him the software. I was never told to bring in software. To make a long story short, I brought the computer back that evening because it the same problems. I was told that I needed to increase my RAM. I found that funny, as I had just increase the RAM three weeks prior and they had no record of it.  Three weeks later after many phone calls they told me to come in and they would refund me. When I got there they wanted to refund me $84.00 and refused to tell me for what. I wanted to speak to a manager. This man yelled in my face in front of my daughter and said that he was not refunding me. I requested a new RAM because I felt that this was the problem, and he insisted that I pay for all work including the removal of the RAM. When I turned to get the RAM chip, no one wanted to help me as he made it seem that I was stealing. When I brought the RAM chip to the GEEK squad counter, they admitted that they had already taken the chip out and that was the refund they were trying to give me. What's worse was that I paid $130.00 for the RAM. Plus, when I got home, my daughter's computer was still not able to get into the internet and her game was not working. What was worse was that she had viruses.  I still have a non-working laptop with viruses, minus internet service and my daughter's sims game is unable to function. Plus, I am out $400. I also have a bruised ego, as the GOON squad bouncer yelled in my face and made it seem that I was stealing. Hilda of New City, NY     12/2/07  I gave my computer to Best Buy for service since it's under warranty. They ran a diagnostic, didn't find anything, and a week later it wouldn't work again. They sent it to a service station in Texas where the problems were fixed and sent it back to Best Buy on Nov. 21. It has been 7 days now; nobody knows where is my pc. The Texas service says it is in Roseville, CA, and Roseville says it must be in Texas. When I called again the guy was rude and acted like I was dumb and stupid. He said if it is stolen, then I have to waite 60 days to get a new pc. To me this is unacceptable. I will never ever buy anything from Best Buy again. I can handle a lot of things, but being treated as if stupid is uncalled for. I also found that if they don't want to talk with you, they do not answer the phone. Elke of Roseville, CA     11/28/07  I own a 1998 BMW 528i that was in excellent condition when I took it to Best Buy in Heath, OH on October 21, 2007 to have a Viper Remote Security System installed. The install appointment was scheduled in advance, and the car was dropped off with them when they opened at 11 A.M. I returned 8 hours later and only part of the work was done. I had to schedule the remaining work (door lock/unlock feature) to be completed that Thursday, October 25. I returned on Thursday and again the car was left for the entire day. When I went back to my car, it was obvious that certain wires were crossed as my panel lights were flashing, the lock/unlock feature was not working properly, the door handle to open the vehicle wasn't the same, and I noticed obvious gouge marks in the side panel where the technician either pried loose or forced open the panel to gain access.  All of this was brought to the attention of store management, and I was assured they would address it the next day. A review of the work order (copy obtained when I dropped the vehicle off compared to the copy when I picked the vehicle up) clearly shows the technician covered his tracks by adding comments indicating the damage was done previously, which it wasn't. The paperwork proving the technician cove-up was presented to the manager. Best Buy assumed liability for the damages to the door panel, and a Best Buy Insurance claim was generated. The store manager assured me that the technician would be fired and his other techs would look at the installation and fix it. The store had my car for 4 more days before making the decision on October 29 that they decided to remove the system from my vehicle because, according to the manager, they couldn't figure out how to do the complete installation properly on my vehicle. The next day when I called the store to inquire of status, I was informed that arrangements were underway by the store to have my vehicle towed to the BMW dealership, Kelly BMW in Easton, OH. The store had my car towed by a non-affiliated AAA tow company without my authorization, and as it turns out, I had to pay the tow bill to get my car from the dealership. I am a AAA Plus member, and if I wanted to have it towed, I would have had it arranged under my coverage. Best Buy Claims did not cover the entire cost of repairs, and I had to incur even more out of pocket to get my car back. Bottom line, I was without my car for over a month, and it cost me almost $600 to get my car back. Surely there are consumer rights issues with my case. I have documented all conversations with all the parties involved, and am very much interested in leveraging a lawsuit at Best Buy. Loss of use, aggravation, $600 out of pocket expense to get my car back -- this is unbelievable...please help. Peter of Granville, OH     11/26/07  I took my HP desk top computer into Best Buy Geek Squad because my desktop would not open. I was getting an error message every time I tried to reboot. The Geek Squad told me it would be $59.00 to diagnostic test, and once that was done they could tell me what the problem was. I called them several days later to get the verdict. The guy told me that I would have to pay an additional $99.00 to get all my files saved before they could continue to fix the problem or I would lose everything. I gave them the o.k.; I am a tax preparer for over 15 years and I asked him to save tax seasons 03, 04, 05 and 06. I finally picked up my computer on Nov 17th, along with a disk from them that I was told had my backup files on. I brought my computer to my home office, plugged everything up, and got the same error message I had when I took it into the store. I marched it right back to Best Buy, and the customer service I received was worse than ever. They refused to plug the system up and confirm my findings and ordered me out the store. I had to pay another computer company to come to my home and get my system operating again.  Also, the Best Buy disk with my back files supposedly on it, was blank. Now they have lost or stolen all of my customers' personal data that can be used for the purpose of identity theft. I called the store and spoke with the Geek, and again no concern or consideration at all. Is this cause for a law suit against Best Buy? Emma of Bartlett, TN     11/26/07  I purchased a Sony Vaio Laptop 3/06. I did not receive the OS re-install nor any of the drivers for the laptop. It never occurred to me to ask for them until 11/07, I am having issues and could reinstall the OS and the drivers myself. I am a professional IT person. Why I didn't think to ask for the re-install I can't recall. So I call the Best Buy in Logan, UT where I purchased the laptop from, requesting to pick-up the re-install discs. I was told it would cost me $29.95 and that I should just get them from the Internet. That isn't the point. I paid over $2600 for this laptop and I purchased a 2year service agreement. I should have been provided all driver and re-install discs at the time of purchase. Kate of Ogden, UT     11/19/07  My 2 1/2-year-old Canon Powershot S70 suddenly stopped working. I had bought the camera and a 4-year warranty from Best Buy, which inspected my camera and sent it to their repair lab, PrecisionCameras.com. They called me and said that my camera had been damaged in a way that voided the warranty, and e-mailed me a photo showing a gouge caused by a tool forcing the two halves of the body apart, and said it would be $199 to fix it. That damage was done AFTER I turned the camera over to Best Buy, but since I wanted the camera to be fixed, I authorized the repair, planning to settle it with Best Buy when I picked it up.  At Best Buy in Emeryville, CA, I explained the situation, showed them the written condition of the camera when I turned it in for repair (minor wear of the paint) and expected to get my camera and leave. They said I had not followed their Procedure. I literally went through FOUR Managers having to explain to each one the circumstances; the guy at the Geek Squad counter; another Geek Squad person (about 19 years old); then his supervisor, a woman of perhaps 30; and finally a man who could make a decision. Even he had to disappear for 5 minutes to talk with precisioncameras, I assume, after offering me to split the difference. I had to stand at the counter for 45 minutes! I refused to pay for any part of the repair. Finally, he gave me my camera at no cost to me. Moral of the Story. IF you buy a Best Buy Warranty, it is no guarantee that it will be honored. Gary of Oakland, CA     11/4/07  I purchased a camera with accident warranty from Best Buy. When I purchased the warranty the salesperson said if anything happens just bring it in and we will replace it. My camera fell and broke; we took it in, and the first time they kept it for four weeks and supposedly fixed it. A month later we took it in, and again they stated that it was fixed. My camera broke again (lens error), and it has been there for two more weeks. I have called the geek squad; no one answers, no recording and my camera is still not fixed. They have very poor customer service! I called teh 800 number to file a complaint about them not picking up the phone, and the operator stated that they are busy and it is best for me to just go into the store. The camera is in the store for the third time, not fixed, and we will most likely have an on-going problem with them. Haydee of New Milford, NJ     10/30/07  I took my Dell laptop in to Best Buy's Geek Squad because of multiple problems. Left with Geek Squad after explanation. After initial diagnosis, they informed me that I had a virus that had wrapped itself around a system file, and they would have to reload my operating system. I knew as recently as two days before that my operating system disk was in the D drive. When I informed them of this, they said it was not there and they couldn't find it. Then I paid over $450 for them to do the above and install Spy Sweeper and an antivirus program. I asked them to only save my Excel and email info. When I picked up the computer, it was running slower and the built-in mouse was not functioning properly, while it was working when I took it in.  The night before my fourth physical visit I discovered that my PCMCIA card was missing. I just about lost it. I went in the next day and asked to see the service manager. He met me at the service counter, and in the presence of one of the robotic geeks, I explained the whole sad story. He then checked the computer and experienced all the things I was complaining about, and suggested to the geek that it may need to be cleaned. I then left for the fourth time, to return later that day to retrieve it.  I got the same robotic response every time I went. There was absolutely no concern, compassion or customer service. I am now out the money and have a missing disc and PCMCIA card. This was one of the most nightmarish experiences I have had recently. I will never darken the door to Best Buy again. Logan of Lakeway, TX     10/11/07  I purchased a Toshiba Satellite laptop computer on March 9, 2007 for personal, at-home use. I also purchased an extended service plan. I purchased it at Best Buy in Trumbull, CT. The computer was working beautifully. The laptop cost me $699; the extended service plan was $129.99. Four weeks ago, I took it out of the drawer I keep it in and opened it up to find the LCD monitor screen seemingly fractured internally. I had never dropped it, nor used it carelessly. There is not one single mark on the entire case. No scratch, no bump, nothing to indicate the cause of this damage. I brought it back to Best Buy, thinking it should be fully warranteed especially since it was just under six months old (when I brought it in) AND I had purchased the extended service plan. I received a call several days ago from Agent Knoxson at Geek Squad telling me it was not covered at all and the cost would be $591 to replace the monitor. Apparently, no one believed that I had not damaged my computer myself. For $591.00 I could buy another laptop ! But that isnt why I'm writing to you. I researched on-line and found that a laptop monitor could be purchased for $220; two of my sons are computer techs and either could do the labor. I also knew I could thus cancel the extended service plan I purchased; after all, I certainly did not need it now. My plan states that this can be done at any Best Buy store. So on Wednesday, October 3, 2007, I went to Best Buy to do so. After much argument with Customer Service, I went home without my refund. The employees were not familiar with refunding for a service plan and told me I'd have to do this by mail (which is not true). I then telephoned Best Buy intending to speak with a manager. I found myself connected with the same clerk I had spoken to. He apologized to me, stating that he had been wrong and that I could indeed cancel the service plan at the store. His name was Steve. I returned on March 5, 2007 expecting to be treated correctly and either get my refund or have my checking account credited with the amount I was due. However, Best Buy refuses to give me a refund or to credit my account. I am entitled to approximately $100 refunded on the price of the two year service plan. Best Buy refuses to give me anything but store credit. This is not acceptable to me. I used my debit card to pay for the laptop and for the service plan. I have no need for store credit. It's unlikely I will ever shop there again. Additionally, my service plan does not state I have to accept store credit. It says refund. I am a 53-year-old widow disabled from multiple sclerosis; in all actuality, I have just given Best Buy $699 for absolutely nothing in return. I have no working laptop and no refund. In order for me to repair the computer, I need money. I feel I am being treated unfairly, possibly illegally. Certainly "customer service" is an incorrect term. Dis-service is more accurate.  I live on a small fixed income; so far, I haven't gotten my money back. I'm still fighting. Alison of Stratford, CT     10/7/07  This is the status and what appears to be a dead end regarding this issue as Best Buy successfully stalled to allow the warrantee to expire. Since August I have been dealing with this. To date I have written over 7 letters to the State of Tennessee regarding this issue. The computer is back in my possession and still is not working. The computer continues to freeze up; the screen is working ok now. I contacted the Geek Squad's main headquarters in August in an attempt to locate my computer and to find out what is the problem. Per the main office at the Geek Squad, there is and has been no record of my computer ever being serviced. There is no record despite my invoices from the Geek Squad of any repairs being done on my computer; the invoice numbers dont even show on record. Now, after all these attempts Best Buy/Geek Squad has advised me that they will no longer service my computer as the warrantee has expired on it. Again, I wrote the State of Tennessee regarding this with no reply received. Now I am stuck with a computer that I paid almost 1,600.00 for it and it does not work properly, is very undependable, and I will have to pay to have it fixed. On the 5 October 2007 I received a letter from the State of Tennessee advising me that there is nothing they can do. One letter from Best Buy dated 21 August states that it was fixed and returned, nothing else. There was no mention of Best Buy refusing to service the computer and delaying service to have the warranty expire, there was no mention that now Best Buy has never fixed the computer and now won't service it even though it has been failing since it broke about 2 months after it was purchased. Best Buy sold me a computer that failed 2 months after it was purchased, I made 8 stops by the store, the computer still is not fixed, and now they won't service it because they delayed the repairs until after the manufactures warranty expired. BEWARE OF BEST BUY! There are clearly many unanswered questions and what appears to be fraud on the part of Best Buy and the Geek Squad.  I'm out a $1560.00 computer, lost over $6000 income, 26 hours drive time from home to Best Buy, and time attempting to resolve issue--weeks! John of Thorn Hill, TN     10/6/07  My Compaq Presario PC with Windows Vista keeps becoming unstable. I can't download Windows Updates and I have gotten blue screened twice. I brought it to Geek Squad after the first time it wouldn't allow me to download updates and paid EXTRA for Geek Squad to fix that. Apparently, they took my money for doing nothing, because the computer is acting as weird as before. Geek Squad (and Best Buy, for that matter) NEVER pick up their phones. The way they handle customers is a glaring disgrace!  Christopher of Stamford, CT     9/22/07  Recently, the Geek Squad did a very poor job of installing software and hardware onto my home computer. As a result, the computer is now unusable. Geek Squad refuses to make fixing their mistakes a priority, and has informed me that I will have to wait weeks for a service person to return to my house. I then informed them that I would not pay for this installation, because it was not properly done the first time, and since the store would not correct the problem in a timely manner, then I was not going to pay for the installation. One of the store managers insisted that I did have to pay for the installation, whether it was done properly or not.  Robert of Randolph, NJ     9/22/07  I purchased an LCD monitor from Best Buy along with a 2 year warranty plan. Within a year my monitor stopped working so I took it in to Best Buy in Castleton and dropped it off at the Geed Squad repair center on March 30th 2007. I was expecting that I would hear something about the monitor within a few weeks of dropping it off, but I never did. I finally attempted to contact Best Buy Castleton store on June 8th 2007. At first they could not find any record of my transaction in their system. After several phone calls and a supposed investigation? they found a very mixed up record of my transaction.  When I asked what would be done to replace my monitor he told me that his system also showed that I had already been issued a replacement monitor (a 22 widescreen monitor) and that was why I never received a call from them. When I told him that a replacement had never been issued, he said that there was nothing he could do because that is what his system showed and that there was nothing further they could do for me from the store level.  He said that he was going to conduct and investigation into the matter and would be calling me back. He gave me the case # of 38665075 along with a direct extension of X60387 for contacting him at Customer Service. Of course I never heard back from him or anyone at customer service. I did try to call again in early August and got a similar run-around where I spoke to an agent, had to explain my whole story again, and was told after conducting an investigation? that someone was looking into it and would get back with me. I did get a follow up message on my voice mail a few days later that someone was working on this and that I would get another call soon, but never got another call after that.  Lisa of Indianapolis, IN     9/21/07   On 2/14/2007 I bought a Compaq computer at Best Buy. I was told they had to burn recovery cd`s for the comp that would be an additional cost to me. The comp was purchased as a gift to my daughter. She barely used it and had only had it 2 months when it wouldn’t even go into windows. I tried running the recovery disk’s. They failed to work. On 4/11/2007 I took it back to Best Buy and was told I would get it back by the 19th. Today is April 26 and when I called they told me everything checks out on the hard ware so they have to rerun the recovery software and I will have to pay an additional 129.00. Amy of Indpls, IN     4/26/07  my son purchased a compaq laptop from Wal-Mart in Oct-Nov 2006. Over the months he developed a virus on my computer. So he took his computer to the best geeks to check what was happening with it. A few days later he had to call them to find out what is going on with his computer, they stated that the computer had a trojan virus, so he asked how much would it be for it to be removed and for them to bring the computer back to working order, they stated between 2 to 3 hundred dollars, he allowed them to go ahead and remove the virus and anything else necessary needed to be done.  After receiving his computer back from best buy. He came home and set up his computer and found that his computer doesn't work at all. He has no files, no programs, no nothing. He took his computer back to best buy to have the problem resolved and they stated that they are not responsible for the damages done and they didn't know that this problem was gonna arise. They refuse to resolve the problem or even reimburse my son's money. So now my son's computer sits in a corner collecting dust which he only had for 5 months from date of purchase for best buy to screw it up then tells us that we cannot do anything about it. Lisa of Waianae, HI     3/30/07  I took my 3 month old p c into the best buy because it was shutting down on me. I had gotten extended 2 year warranty, they assured me they would fix it. Well, after 8 days of calling all the time and driving way to Biddeford to drop off the recovery disk i had, I finally got the machine home -- and less then 24 hours later it is doing the same thing. Shirley of Sanford, ME     3/26/07  My HP owuld not allow me to access the internet. I know I was connected because I hooked up my mac and I had internet access. Unlike other pc's the ethernet card cannot be replaced because it it soddered to the mother board. when I took it in to the geek squad they said they had to do a diagnostic and they will call me in a week.   Here it is almost two weeks later and no call and when I visited them they said its about 3rd on the list to get to. This is taking to freaking long for a lousy diagnostic. I'm just ****** because it seems I deal with someone different every time and who knows what goes on behind that wall if anything.
