As founder and “chief inspector,” as he likes to refer to himself, Stephens is responsible for positioning The Geek Squad as the nation’s largest technology support company.                     Stephens’ lecture, Geeks Unite: How Geek Squad Used Reputation to Build a Strong Brand, was insightful, relevant and unexpectedly humorous. While delving into his past he shared some of his most significant public relations and business management tactics. His most noteworthy points included creating an interesting brand, the importance of practicing transparency and authenticity, tips for managing new businesses and the value of visualizing your competition.                      “Above all else, a company must have a great logo.” Stephens emphasized iconic corporate brands, such as Apple, with timeless graphic designs inspired by simplicity. He advised attendees to envision a company’s brand as a movie title; he believes a brand should project heart, soul and social relevance.       Authenticity and transparency start with employees. It is important to inspire and influence from the top so employees understand and project the story behind the brand. “Authenticity can’t be faked. PR has to be earned,” says Stephens.      Three techniques that facilitated Stephens’ success as an entrepreneur: take care of your employees, don’t take yourself too seriously and make decisions that are true to your brand.         Envision and attempt to create your business’s arch enemy to proactively address your shortcomings and promote innovation. You will always benefit from knowing your competition.                  Reminiscing of childhood memories, like watching “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,” Stephens emphasized the importance of having a fun and interesting corporate culture just as Wonka did. “Don’t be afraid to be different and remember it’s all about living.”                   -Emily Randisi, Gillian Love      Posted by Jason Anthoine on June 02, 2009 at 12:03 PM  |  Permalink       TrackBack TrackBack URL for this entry: http://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a00d83544662e53ef011570b8a484970b  Listed below are links to weblogs that reference  Geeks Unite: How Geek Squad Used Reputation to Build a Strong Brand :     Comments   Father's day is forthcoming, and there is a men's suit, on http://www.sanseed.com/attractive-black-single-breasted-button-lapel-flap-wool-business-suit.html, anyone give me a idea?
