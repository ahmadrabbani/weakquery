This program is open to all girls entering grades 6 through 12 in the fall who would like an opportunity to increase their technology know-how.   The program will explore a variety of topics, including digital media, internet communications, green technology, and website design. Geek Squad Summer Academy, a national program started by Geek Squad Agents in 2006 and hosted by Girl Scouts Heart of New Jersey, will take place July 13 -14, 9:00am – 4:00pm at Mount Saint Mary Academy, 1645 U.S. 22, Watchung, NJ.  The two day program will teach girls the basic components of technology through fun, engaging, and informative activities not likely found in a traditional school setting. The cost for the program is $35 per girl, which includes wearable Geek Squad gear (there is an additional cost of $12 for non Girl Scouts, which includes Girl Scout membership and access to other Girl Scouts Heart of New Jersey programs.)   The mission of the Geek Squad Summer Academy is to inspire a passion for, and comfort with technology through fun interactive classes and activities.  By partnering with the Geek Squad Summer Academy, Girl Scouts Heart of New Jersey aims to enhance the understanding of technology for girls in the Council’s communities. This program will help girls confidently, resourcefully, and effectively navigate the increasingly connected world. It will also broaden the possibility of an exciting future in today’s quickly evolving high-tech culture.  Girls can make new friends while learning new skills. All girls are welcome to participate regardless of their prior knowledge of and comfort level with technology.   Girl Scouts Heart of New Jersey builds girls of courage, confidence, and character who make the world a better place.  For information on Girl Scouts or to volunteer, call 908-518-4400 or visit us at www.gshnj.org.
