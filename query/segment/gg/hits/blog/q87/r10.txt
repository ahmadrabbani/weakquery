Zoellick       Annual Meetings 2010 Teleconference Monday,       October 4, 2010     OPERATOR:     Welcome, and thank you for standing by.   At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.        After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.   To ask a question, please press start, then one.   You will be prompted to record your first and last name.         Today's conference is being recorded.   If there are any objections, please disconnect at this time.   I would now like to turn the conference over to the first presenter, Carl Hanlon.         MR. HANLON:     Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, this is Carl Hanlon from the World Bank.   Thank you very much for joining us today.        World Bank Group President Robert Zoellick will brief you on the upcoming Annual Meetings, which start here in Washington later this week, as you know.         After his statement, Mr. Zoellick will take a few questions.   This is a moderated call; your questions will be answered in turn.   Kindly identify yourself and your organization before asking your question.            Mr. Zoellick's remarks will be on-the-record unless otherwise specified.         Mr. Zoellick, go ahead, please, sir.         MR. ZOELLICK:     Okay.   Thank you, Carl.        Well, thanks all of you for joining us.   I thought it would be useful to brief you on some of the issues at our Annual Meetings.   When we meet with the 187 member countries of the World Bank later this week, we'll be focusing on several things: assessing the crisis two years on, how we have responded, and what more developing countries need, including IDA.         As part of an effort to improve governance, we're going to have more streamlined meetings, and I'll be opening on Friday with PowerPoint report instead of a speech.         In assessing the crisis, global growth has returned but it has slowed since May and will not be fast enough to make inroads into unemployment and spare capacity.   Industrial production has slowed worldwide and the bounce-back in global trade has probably come to an end.            There's been a lot of talk about a new normal.   Perhaps we should be talking more about a recent abnormal.   The 2005-2008 period wasn't normal and nor are we likely to return to it.   With a fragile recovery like this, some worry about a double-dip recession, but for now we don't think this will happen.         Very significantly, and it's a report that has repercussions beyond the immediate, developing countries are growing at a faster pace than developed countries.   They are becoming a growing source of demand in the world economy.   Developing countries are expected to account for about one-half of global growth in the several years ahead, but these developing countries also face significant challenges.   It's crucial for us to help address these challenges if they are to remain a pillar of support for the global economy.         While many developing countries have regained access to capital markets, bank lending remains weak.   In net terms--so, new loans, less repayments--bank lending is likely to be negative for this year as a whole, and this will be a drag on growth.         Also, for many developing countries, the food crisis of 2008 has never gone away and recent prices are a serious cause for concern.   The rise in wheat prices over the last few months is affecting the price of other staples due to increased demand for substitutes.   So, we'll have to find a way to avoid food crises becoming the new normal.         This challenging environment calls for further concrete policy responses.   We have to take measures to shore up confidence, provide the framework for economic and underpinning for credit to flow and for businesses to invest in machinery, equipment, new technology that will boost productivity, create jobs, and generate long-term growth.   We need pro-growth policies.         But at the same time, we have to be on high alert for new risks.   Slow growth in the developed world and high growth in developing world is causing distortions in global financial markets.   You've heard the warnings of currency wars.   Money is chasing yield, it can't find those yields in developed economies, and this is not only pushing up currency values in emerging and developing countries, it's also pushing up the price of some assets with the risks of bubbles in property and some commodities.         Another risk is that the low interest rate environment will not last forever.   At some point, rates will go up, and this will cause a deflating of currently unrealistically high prices in bond markets.         We've seen how damaging a recession can be that's caused by a financial crisis, so we need to be on guard to prevent future problems.   These risks are not only significant for the global economy, they can also damage developing countries and harm the poor people living in them who have a much smaller cushion to rely on in difficult times.         In discussing the World Bank's policy response so far, we'll be reporting to our 187 member countries that we provided $138 billion in financial support--that's loans, grants, and equity--since the crisis really got underway in mid 2008.   We've sought to become faster and more flexible, but we need to do more and to remain vigilant at the time of looming risks.         Ten days ago in New York, leaders reaffirmed their commitment to try to meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.            IDA, our fund for the 79 poorest countries, is a key part of this.   Over the last 10 years, we estimate that IDA has helped save 13 million lives.   With a robust IDA replenishment, we could immunize 200 million more children, extend health services to over 30 million more people, give access to improved water sources to 80 million more people, help build 80,000 kilometers of roads and train and recruit over 2 million teachers.   We won't be discussing specific IDA commitment numbers at this meeting, but we will be asking donors to step up to support IDA by the end of the year.         You may have seen some recent articles pointing to the large number of poor people in so-called middle-income countries, and this emphasizes the importance of our recent record-setting lending from IBRD.         A new multipolar world means a variety of things.   It means more voice.   We boosted developing country voice to more than 47 percent in the IBRD; that's a shift of more than 4.5 percent over the last two years.   We're adding a third chair for Sub-Saharan Africa on November 1, and we--I believe we can also get to equitable voting power over time.         We are also making substantial staff changes to better reflect the changing world.   For the first time in the World Bank's history, all our Managing Directors and our Chief Economist are from developing countries.         A new multipolar world also means changing how we at the Bank do research.   We recognize we don't have all the answers.   We have to revisit old assumptions and open our doors to new ideas.   We're moving to a new model for development research, one that gives people outside the Bank the tools to do their own research and make their own conclusions.   So, we'll draw on the experience and knowledge of people in developing countries, those who are closest to the problem of poverty.         In April, we threw open our databases for all people free of charge and then we implemented an access of information policy based on the Freedom of Information Acts in India and the United States.   We believe this is a pace-setter for other multilateral institutions.         This week, we'll be doubling the amount of data available on our open access platform and doing so in multiple languages, and we're launching an "Apps for Development" competition to encourage and identify new innovative tools and applications using the date we made available.         We're also going to be releasing new software tools so that researchers can crunch their own numbers, do some of their own simulations, double-check our results.         At the Annual Meetings, we're going to hold an open forum, a two-day, online global live Internet session on the key development issues of the day.   So, I hope this gives you a flavor of the agenda we have ahead of us, and I'd be pleased to take your questions.         MR. HANLON:     Okay.   And if you could kindly state your name and the name of your organization, we'd greatly appreciate it.        OPERATOR:     Thank you.        At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press start, then one.   You will be prompted to record your first and last name, and to withdraw your request, press start then 2.         Once again, to ask a question, press star, then one.         Our first question comes from Howard Schneider.    Your line is open.         MR. SCHNEIDER:     Hi, President Zoellick, how are you?        I was just wondering, going back to your brief reference you made of the currency issues around the world, it seems like both the IMF and most recently Institute for International Finance today expressed concern that the--sort of the pace of cooperation sort of seems to be--seems to be slowing.   And I just wondered from your seat there, what--what--how real do you think these risks are that countries are going to revert to a more unilateral approach to this next phase of the recovery and what risks that might hold to the developing world.         MR. ZOELLICK:     Well, the genesis of this problem goes all the way back to the breakdown of the old fixed rate system in the '70s.   So, that was the old Bretton Woods system, so the issue has been with us for a while, and actually, when I was at the Treasury in the '80s, we dealt with this with a focus on Japan, in particular, but I think what's now added complexity is the phenomenon of the emerging markets playing a larger role in the global economy, and then the question of their currency policies.        In general, given the fragility of this recovery, I think it's important to manage any of the downside risks, whether they be from trade protectionism or currency disputes or other sources of conflict.         I don't foresee that we're moving into an era of currency wars, but there are clearly going to be tensions, particularly if you have surplus countries--so, countries that have trade surpluses or current account surpluses--that are propping up their currency or intervening to keep their currencies at lower rates.   So, that's a topic that is more natural in the IMF context, but it certainly adds to the overall sensitivity.         In the case of some of the economies, particularly the U.S. and China, the bigger issue is not just currency; it's a question of the rebalancing of the consumption and savings.   And here, if you look at the U.S. and China, in some ways they're somewhat outliers in the system, China having a very high savings rate, lower consumption, the U.S. having higher consumption and lower savings rate, and part of the challenge will be structural policies in both countries to try and change that.         When I was in China two or three weeks ago, I had extensive discussions with the Chinese leadership about their own interests in moving towards structural changes to increase consumption as opposed to savings, and this is a topic that we at the Bank will be working with them on.         Obviously, you've got a similar debate here in the United States when you're talking about spending and budget deficit.         MR. HANLON:     Okay.   Our next question, please.        OPERATOR:     Once again, to ask a question, press star, then one.        MR. HANLON:     Lesley, did you have a question?        OPERATOR:     Lesley Wroughton, your line is open.                              MS. WROUGHTON:     Sorry.        Mr. Zoellick, I was wondering what--how you see or--since many of these countries that are dealing with increased currencies or appreciation are in the developing world, how would you foresee that a lot of them deal with this issue right now?   And how can you also foresee the G20 trying to address the issue?         The other issue I want to ask you about is the food crisis.   Have you seen a lot of countries coming to the Bank this time for help or do you think that many of them have learned from the 2008 food crisis and are implementing policies according to that.     MR. ZOELLICK:     Let me start with your second question on food prices.        As you know, Lesley, we as an institution put in a rapid crisis response mechanism at the time of 2007 and 2008 so we could try to help the most vulnerable countries, whether with safety net policies or with things like feed and fertilizers.         Because that was an emergency intervention, we--our Board had decided to let it lapse, and I asked that we reinstate it.   So, we've now got that tool to move more quickly.         Second, we as an institution and some of the donors have supported a broader effort at food security to increase agricultural production and productivity, and we're estimating now that our lending in this field in upcoming years will probably be on the level or range of $6- to $8 billion a year.   That's obviously important to help these countries to be able to have their own base of food.         But there's a third issue that I think needs further attention, and I hope to try to plant some seeds at this meeting that can be picked up at the G20 meetings on this, and that's the danger of ongoing volatility in food markets, sometimes exacerbated by steps that people take to interfere with markets.         So, the export bans add to a sense of uncertainty and panic.   In some cases, information about stock availability in many countries isn't as transparent as it should be.         In particular, we need to have the mechanisms to help the humanitarian aid agencies, particularly the World Food Programme be able to respond more quickly.   That ranges from everything from a project we have with WFP and the World Meteorological Organization to do long-range weather forecasting in Africa to some work we're now doing with WFP on the use of derivatives markets.   It would also help if the world gave them some multiyear funding so they didn't have to identify the crisis, get the source of support, then buy it, then transport it.         So, part of what one is seeing is that, as you look at the prices, some prices like rice came down somewhat but they still stayed relatively high.   As people have seen, wheat has gone up.   We're not forecasting a return to the 2007-2008 problems, but we are seeing more volatility in this marketplace, and as we examine country-by-country, I'm--Mauritania is one that comes to mind--the food bill is a huge part of the local budgets.   And so, if you get a 40 percent increase in the price of wheat, it can put big holes in peoples' income.   So, this is an area that I think is going to need ongoing attention.   We had some discussions with some think tanks and WFP and actually Secretary Vilsack at the end of the last week trying to plant some ideas that we could move forward in this area.         And obviously, climate change and some of the other uncertainties just exacerbates some of the prospects when you face droughts and other conditions, climatic conditions.         On your other question about the developing countries and investment flows in currency, it obviously varies a lot.   You've got some countries that are surplus countries, you've got some that are deficit countries.   I think in general, one of the issues we have to watch of the large liquidity in international markets is that money is chasing yield, just as it did in 2005 and 2007, and that always can plant the seeds for future problems.         So, and some of that chasing yield is going into developing countries.   Now, here again you have to look at different situations.   What we generally have found is that the countries' access to foreign direct investment and bond markets is improving again.   Those that are weaker credits obviously have the higher spreads, but what I noted in my opening remarks is a point particularly important to us, which is that bank credit is staying very, very low and we believe that, with repayments, it will be negative this year.   That's important because the poorer countries, or the poorer companies in those countries, don't have access to the bond markets.         And so, one of the issues we have to deal with--and this is, in part, an IDA phenomenon, but some of the things we deal with IFC, as well--is to try to make sure that some of the weaker countries don't get pushed further to the periphery in the nature of the way that this recovery is taking from.         MR. HANLON:     Okay.   Thanks very much.   Do we have a final question?         OPERATOR:     Yes.   Rebecca Christie, your line is open.         MS. CHRISTIE:     Thanks very much for taking my question.        In terms of the global economy, you said early on that you thought that growth was returning but not enough to get the job market going.   So, what kind of growth are you seeing, what kind of growth do you think is needed, and what can be done to get there?         MR. ZOELLICK:     Well, both we and the IMF put out regular forecasts.   As someone who has dealt with these things for a while, I always take forecasts with a grain of salt, but if you would like to know, our forecast is for global GDP growth of about 3.5 percent this year, slowing a little bit to 3.3 percent in 2011, and then picking up again in 2012.        Of that, we forecast GDP growth in developing countries of about 6.6 percent in 2010, and just a little bit under 6 percent in 2011.   And in developed countries, it would be 2.5 percent in 2010 and 2.3 percent in 2011.         The IMF numbers vary a little bit.   They use slightly different purchasing power numbers, but what you basically see with the magnitude of these numbers is that, when you would have such a sharp downturn in the past, the market would have higher growth and that would cut into some of the unemployment.   We're not seeing that particularly in developed countries.         And the key difference in this recovery with past ones is the developing countries are stepping up to fill the gap.   As I mentioned, they are now about half of global growth.   If you go back to, say, even ten years ago, they may have only been about 25 or 30 percent of global growth.   But those developing countries are also going to start to level off, as you start to see in China and India.         One aspect about this for the Bank is that for many of these developing countries, they've used our financing to be able to give them fiscal support.   So, as I mentioned, we've done about $138 billion across the full range of activity.         So, one key lesson is we have to stay active in this market.   We're going to have to continue to lean forward and the demand that we're getting from everything from private sector firms in developing countries to our IDA borrowers where we need to get the replenishment to the middle-income countries remains very strong.         MR. HANLON:     Okay.   Thanks very much, Rebecca Christie from [Bloomberg – ed.].   Do we have a final question?         OPERATOR:     Yes.        Howard Schneider, your line is open.         MR. SCHNEIDER:     I just wondered quickly on sort of a different topic, President Zoellick, while we have you on the phone--        MR. ZOELLICK:     By the way, Howard, you should call me either Bob or--no one calls me President Zoellick.        MR. SCHNEIDER:     Fair enough.   I'm trying to play to the crowd there.        I'm just wondering if you had any conversations with the Administration, the Obama Administration, about this issue of, you know, the future of IMF and World Bank and whether or not the gentleman's agreement has, you know, outlived its usefulness, regarding your possible successor at a future date.         MR. ZOELLICK:     Well, I'm in touch with the Administration as well as the Congress frequently on a whole host of issues dealing with individual countries and problems and certainly we talk with them.        For example, when we did our Voice change, which got our 4.5 percent change,that required close support from the United States.                     We haven't talked about any changes in terms of our governance structure in terms of the Board.   We have a different type of board, in some ways, than the IMF because we have to raise money through--for the foreign assistance and for IDA.   Frankly, some of the donor countries deserve to have representation that are big donors, like the Nordic countries.         We went a slightly different approach.   We added a chair for Sub-Saharan Africa, as I mentioned, and that will now be going in place on November 1.         And as for what follows me, that's for other people to decide, I guess.         MR. HANLON:     Okay.   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.   We greatly appreciate your participation today, and that concludes our conference call.        Thank you very much.         MR. ZOELLICK:     Thank you.        OPERATOR:     Thank you for joining today's conference.   That does conclude the call at this time.        All participants may disconnect.                    Permanent URL for this page:  http://go.worldbank.org/ASLNV8DP10               Home  |  Site Map  |  Index  |  FAQs  |  Contact Us  |  Search  |    RSS     © 2011  The World Bank Group , All Rights Reserved.
