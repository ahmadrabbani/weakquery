This usually occurs when their economies are in danger of default through overspending and extensive borrowing. This often leads to  hyperinflation and devaluation of their currencies. The World Bank is not actually a bank in the common sense. Instead, it is made up of two development institutions owned by 186 member countries—the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA). What Is the Purpose of the World Bank?: The World Bank provides low-interest loans, interest-free credits and grants to developing countries. In return, the country must adhere to strict budgetary reforms. It must agree to cut back on spending and support its currency. The World Bank loans are usually to invest in education, health, and infrastructure. The loans can also be used to modernize a country's financial sector, agriculture, and natural resource management. World Bank History: The World Bank was created in 1944 to lend to primarily European countries that had been destroyed in the war to help them rebuild. It evolved from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). The World Bank was based in Washington, D.C., and was primarily staffed with engineers.   Since then, it has expanded to a closely associated group of five development institutions whose purpose is to reduce worldwide poverty. It operates closely with its affiliate, the International Development Association, and other members of the World Bank Group, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).
