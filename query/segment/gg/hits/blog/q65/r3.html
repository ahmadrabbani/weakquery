          <p>Longwood University  graduates <a href="warneraddress06.html">were told</a> Saturday (May 13) to not be afraid to fail, to be civil in  political discourse and to remember their family and friends.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;The diplomas that you will receive  are, by all statistical measures, tickets to a better&nbsp; life,&rdquo; said former governor Mark Warner. &ldquo;I  know that when I became the first in my family to graduate college, I would be  able to do things and go places that my parents only dreamed of. But there is a  price for this ticket &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t mean the interest in the student loans. The  price of this unparalleled opportunity is the responsibilities that come with  this world-class education.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;First, there is an obligation that  we ask you to keep with yourselves, and that&rsquo;s: don&rsquo;t be afraid to fail.  Second, there is a responsibility you have to the community &ndash; a basic  obligation that all who live here have, but, unfortunately, too few take  seriously. And that&rsquo;s to conduct our political debates in a civil and  respectful manner. My final piece of advice is perhaps the most important  lesson that I can leave you with today. Call your mother. Call your father.  Call your grandparents, girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands and wives. And I say  that not just because I was in the cellphone business. I say that because if  you&rsquo;re going to be honest with yourself you didn&rsquo;t get here alone.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>He also told the graduates &ldquo;No  matter how many days and how many miles separate you from your time here in  Farmville, never forget what you learned here. Reject the cynicism and shallow  posturing that dominate our media. Tune out the shouting and background noise  that masquerade as meaningful commentary. Instead, wrestle with the complex  issues, be respectful of those with whom you disagree, and always remember that  despite our glorious differences, a love of country binds us together &ndash; as  Americans.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;If you remember nothing else I say  today, remember this: No one &ndash; <em>no one</em> &ndash; in politics has a monopoly on virtue, on patriotism, or, most importantly, on  the truth. And that goes for conservatives and liberals &ndash; and everyone in between.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Warner, governor from 2002 until  this January, received an <a href="honorarydegree06.html">honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree</a>. Some 770  bachelor&rsquo;s and 164 master&rsquo;s degrees were awarded to graduates who completed  their degree requirements this May, last December and last August.</p>

          <p>Another graduate who participated  in the ceremony was Jerome Kersey, who enjoyed a 17-year NBA career, mostly  with the Portland Trailblazers, after attending Longwood from 1980-84, during  which he was a first team Division II All-American his senior year. Kersey, a Clarksville native who now lives in Happy   Valley, Ore., Portland suburb, received a B.S. in social  work after completing the two courses he needed. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;When I talked with Jerome at the  Longwood Hall of Fame induction ceremony (last Nov. 27),&rdquo; said Dr. Wayne McWee,  vice president for academic affairs, &ldquo;he told me that he wanted to graduate so  that his daughter could be proud of her dad for graduating from college. He  worked with Dr. Charles Ross (dean of the College of Arts and Sciences) and Dr.  Theresa Clark (associate professor of social work).&rdquo;</p>
          <p>William J. &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Gouldin Jr.,  president and CEO of Strange&rsquo;s Florists, Greenhouses &amp; Garden Centers, also  graduated, although he didn&rsquo;t attend the ceremony. Gouldin, of Rockville, Va.,  a member of the Corporate Advisory Board in the College of Business &amp;  Economics, received a B.S. in business administration with a concentration in  management. He has been working for about a year and a half to complete his  degree requirements. </p>
