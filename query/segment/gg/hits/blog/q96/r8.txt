Contributor Network Nov 9, 2010 "Contribute content like this.  Start Here ."         Flag  Close      Post a comment        Released in 2003, former addict James Frey's book, "A Million Little Pieces," contains some gruesome passages and adult content that may or may not be true. According to Smokinggun.com, "Frey appears to have fictionalized his past to propel and sweeten the book's...and help convince readers of his malevolence". When I read that statement it forced me to think about why one would want to appear malevolent and publicly make lies about oneself that are anything but flattering (Frey even admits that lying became a part of his life). Frey talks about his desire to cry, kill, die, and run away on page thirty-three. However, he realizes, "but there's nowhere to run so I pace and I rub my body and I feel cold." Smokinggun.com describes Frey as a "raging young man who hated living in leafy, prosperous St. Joesph, Michigan." Perhaps Frey was indeed bored with his quiet life and was feeling ignored. Perhaps he was using drugs to fill this void and then later realized he could use his experiences to elicit attention and sympathy. Perhaps his honesty is a testament to his complete acceptance for his actions which gives him the power to change. He is trying to tell others that they can change too if they stop placing the blame on other people and things. Or, perhaps his memory is so retarded from drug abuse and regular blackouts that in his mind-this truly is his honest recollections of his life! Regardless of the validity of Frey's stories, there is much to be learned from this book and much to be said.
