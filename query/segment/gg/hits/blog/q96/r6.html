  &quot;Authorities had no immediate suspects or information on the victims. Ciudad

  with at least 1,400 people killed this year alone. Most of the homicides are

  Opium Production Back on Rise</a> (Sept. 2, 2009)<br>
  &quot;A Feb. 2 report by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime found 
  that the price of opium in Burma, also known as Myanmar, increased by 15% last 
  year. As a result, Burmese land dedicated to poppy cultivation actually expanded 
  in 2008, despite promises by the country's ruling junta to combat its reputation 
  as one of the world's most notorious narco-states.&quot; </p>

  the Taliban Stockpiling Opium? And If So, Why?</a> (Sept. 2, 2009)<br>
  &quot;If international drug- and law-enforcement officials are right, the Taliban 
  might be hiding up to $3.2 billion worth of opium inside Afghanistan, potentially 
  causing huge complications for NATO's decision this month to attack Afghanistan's 
  opium laboratories and smuggling networks. If it exists, the drug stockpile 
  would also have a major bearing on Afghan officials' tentative peace talks with 
  the Taliban, which are favored by U.S. Central Command chief General David Petraeus 
  and both U.S. presidential candidates.&quot; </p>

  &quot;But there is a twist. Afghan poppy crops are now high-yield, say U.N. 
  officials, thanks to better irrigation methods and especially good rains over 
  the past year. While acreage devoted to the flowers fell, production of opium 
  itself dropped only 10% in Afghanistan last year, to about 6,900 tons. Each 
  hectare of poppies yielded about 123 lb. (56 kg) of opium  15% more than last 
  year.&quot; </p>

  Stats on Cocaine Prices Hide Truth About War on Drugs</a> (July 22, 2009)<br>
  &quot;John Walters had some data he wanted to make public, but he also had a 
  credibility problem. Just two years earlier, in 2005, Walters, the countrys 
  drug czar, had cited a hike in the price of cocaine as a battlefield victory 
  in the war on drugsonly to see the price fall just as he was touting the increase. 
  He was ridiculed in some quarters of the press; others decided to stop listening 
  to him. This time around, in the summer of 2007, Walters went looking for the 
  most receptive audience he could find. So he zipped down New York Avenue to 
  the headquarters of The Washington Times, the conservative daily based in the 
  outskirts of Washington, D.C. Walters, according to a staffer present at the 
  briefing, came with a small staff and a stack of glossy pages making the case 
  that the United States had turned a corner in the war on drugs. Prices for cocaine, 
  he said, were rising fast. And that, he explained, can only mean a decline in 
  supply. The Times wouldnt bite. The data were suspiciously thin.&quot; </p>

  Policy Magazine Exposes Folly of Marijuana Ban</a> (July 22, 2009)<br>
  &quot;The reason why the editor of Foreign Policy magazine Moises Naim's recent 
  column is significant is because for far too long the foreign policy community 
  has been a willing conduit for exporting America's wrongheaded and failed cannabis 
  prohibition around the globe. But, the American dominance of the drug policy 
  debate has started to wane over the last 8-10 years in quarters like the United 
  Nations, and columns like Mr. Naim's underscore the myriad reasons why America's 
  elected policymakers need to adopt a reform mindset--notably under an Obama 
  administration--not status quo retrenchment into an unyielding, prohibition-centric 
  cannabis policy.&quot; </p>

  czar: Feds won't support legalized pot</a> (July 22, 2009)<br>
  &quot;The federal government is not going to pull back on its efforts to curtail 
  marijuana farming operations, Gil Kerlikowske, director of the White House's 
  Office of National Drug Control Policy, said Wednesday in Fresno. The nation's 
  drug czar, who viewed a foothill marijuana farm on U.S. Forest Service land 
  with state and local officials earlier Wednesday, said the federal government 
  will not support legalizing marijuana. 'Legalization is not in the president's 
  vocabulary, and it's not in mine,' he said. Kerlikowske said he can understand 
  why legislators are talking about taxing marijuana cultivation to help cash-strapped 
  government agencies in California. But the federal government views marijuana 
  as a harmful and addictive drug, he said. 'Marijuana is dangerous and has no 
  medicinal benefit,' Kerlikowske said in downtown Fresno while discussing Operation 
  SOS -- Save Our Sierra -- a multiagency effort to eradicate marijuana in eastern 
  Fresno County.&quot; </p>

  Are the Drug Lords?</a> (July 21, 2009)<br>
  &quot;Who are the drug lords? They are every politician who lives and breathes 
  war, drugs, terror or otherwise. They are the corrupt corporate heads, malicious 
  media barons, venomous judges and cretinous cops, who, knowing full well the 
  truth, choose to follow their nose to riches, to embrace a lie, to feed their 
  evil cornucopia with the lives of their fellow man.&quot; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.strategypage.com/qnd/afghan/articles/20090719.aspx" target="a">Something 
  Is Happening Down There</a> (July 21, 2009)<br>
  &quot;The battle against the drug gangs is a complicated one. A lot of money 
  is involved, and the drug lords are pretty smart. They now keep a lot of their 
  processing (opium into morphine or heroin) labs mobile. The vehicles travel 
  with armed guards, but force is a last resort. The security detachment is also 
  armed with a lot of cash, and the first weapon to be deployed is a bribe. That 
  usually works. But the U.S. intelligence troops are after the drug gangs now, 
  and this makes concealment more difficult. The U.S. military isn't releasing 
  any play-by-play of these operations, lest they provide useful information to 
  the enemy. It won't be until the end of August that an initial assessment is 
  possible, and not until the end of the year until one can check the trends in 
  wholesale and retail prices for heroin. As Afghanistan heroin production grew 
  since the 1990s, the world supply has doubled, and prices have come down by 
  about 50 percent. More people are using, and dying from, heroin. And now we 
  can add many of the victims of the fighting in southern Afghanistan to that 
  toll.&quot; </p>

  boosts its war in Afghanistan</a> (July 19, 2009)<br>
  &quot;The move is seen as a recognition that the war in Afghanistan cannot be 
  won with military force alone. Until near the end of its eight years in office, 
  the Bush administration failed to link the drug traffickers in Afghanistan with 
  the rising insurgency, basing its anti-drug campaign primarily on an effort 
  to destroy the vast fields of poppy that produce more than 90 percent of the 
  world's heroin....After Sept. 11, the Bush administration's focus on counterterrorism 
  and, later, the war in Iraq, extensively depleted U.S. global counternarcotics 
  efforts, especially in South Asia, they say. The DEA also suffered from hiring 
  freezes, budget cuts and a lack of political support despite its intelligence 
  showing ever-closer links between drug traffickers and terrorist groups.&quot;</p>

  Timothy Leary Right?</a> (May 3, 2007)<br>
  &quot;Are psychedelics good for you? It's such a hippie relic of a question 
  that it's almost embarrassing to ask. But a quiet psychedelic renaissance is 
  beginning at the highest levels of American science, including the National 
  Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and Harvard, which is conducting what is thought 
  to be its first research into therapeutic uses of psychedelics (in this case, 
  Ecstasy) since the university fired Timothy Leary in 1963. But should we be 
  prying open the doors of perception again? Wasn't the whole thing a disaster 
  the first time? The answer to both questions is yes.&quot; </p>

  &quot;In today's world, the US government's use of torture and complicity in 
  its clients' use of it is part of the headlines on a regular basis. Yet very 
  few US citizens believe that methods like waterboarding, beating, and electrical 
  shocks could be -- and have been -- used on US citizens.&quot; But the fact 
  that torture is used profusely in US jails and prisons is unsurprising to those 
  who've been inside the US &quot;justice&quot; system.</p>

  Tuesdays and Thursdays I think they should be illegal. I don't like drugs. I 
  strongly disapprove of them. The costs are great. But it's expensive to incarcerate

                A MILLION LITTLE PIECES<br>
                By James Frey<br>
                384 pages, $22.95<br>
                April, 2003<br>
                Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, New York </p>
              <p><span class="vbr12">&quot;I woke to the drone of an airplane 
                engine and the feeling of something warm dripping down my chin,&quot; 
                begins &quot;A Million Little Pieces,&quot; James Frey's story 
                of his ascent from crackhouse ground zero. &quot;I lift my hand 
                and feel my face. My front four teeth are gone, I have a hole 
                in my cheek, my nose is broken and my eyes are swollen nearly 
                shut.&quot; His clothes are covered with spit, snot, vomit and 
                blood. He doesn't know how he got on the plane or where he is 
                going, but as he soon finds out, he's on his way to rehab.</span></p>
              <p><span class="vbr12">This is today's &quot;Bright Lights, Big 
                City.&quot; Instead of cocaine and The New Yorker we've got crack 
                and a rehabilitation treatment center in Minnesota. </span><span class="vbr12">The 
                grungy editorial style diligently avoids glorifying the brilliant 
                descriptions of medical torture, explicit (and often hideously 
                demeaning) sex and even more explicit drugs. A stream-of-consciousness 
                lite effect is provided by the absence of quotation marks and 
                paragraph indents. Certain words are idiosyncratically capitalized 
                -- the Bathroom, the Nurses -- perhaps to suggest that old cosmic 
                paranoia feeling that comes with over-indulgence in hallucinatory 
                substances; perhaps to be literary and cute.</span></p>
              <p><span class="vbr12">Despite the Burroughs-inflected literary 
                tics, this is an emotionally penetrating narrative that faithfully 
                portrays the institutional rehabilitation process. It's very commercial, 
                too. Unlike &quot;Naked Lunch,&quot; it would make a nice gift 
                for a friend considering detox (one of the Bush girls, maybe?), 
                whether as a warning or a comfort. Faithful to hallowed marketing 
                considerations going back to St. Augustine, all users are portrayed 
                as hopeless addicts. Drug rapture is described in physical and 
                sexual terms and always leads to horrible crashes. There are no 
                hints that self-medication can be a very effective form of self-treatment 
                for emotional and physical maladies.</span></p>
              <p><span class="vbr12">James Frey operates in a literary zone where 
                the worst case rules to the exclusion of all others. You can't 
                write about the masterpieces that are created while enraptured, 
                the psychological knots untied, the revival of the sheer joy of 
                living. No one can handle drugs. Period. Got that clear? Begin 
                writing. These days, when so many successful folks routinely rely 
                on weird brain torques without requiring professional detoxification, 
                it's not easy to get a gifted writer to fit a book into this Procrustean 
                headlock, much less sign it. It appears that &quot;Go Ask Alice,&quot; 
                by Anonymous, the eternally best-selling classic teenage descent-into-drug-hell 
                tale, supposedly based on a fifteen-year-old girl's diary, was 
                faked. As far as anyone can tell, there never was any teenaged 
                girl's diary. Beatrice Matthews Sparks, a Mormon lady from Utah, 
                most likely made it all up.</span></p>
              <p><span class="vbr12">In &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot;, they've 
                got something better -- a real (and very talented) writer with 
                a real story who believes very firmly in individual responsibility. 
                The author portrays himself as quite heroic in both his rebellion 
                and his determination to quit, reminding me of John Galt in &quot;Atlas 
                Shrugged.&quot; Although it has some synthetic moments, the book 
                is obviously sincere, but the resolution finally boils down to 
                &quot;Just say no.&quot;</span></p>
              <p><span class="vbr12">Frey's case demonstrates that the treatment 
                model can work if the victim is a highly motivated upper-class 
                college drop-out with a concrete physical infancy trauma that 
                can be rooted out in therapy. It also helps to have a loving family 
                show up to help out, even if Dad does have to leave in the middle 
                on one of his emergency business trips. Then there are the political 
                connections made in rehab that enable him to avoid having to do 
                time for an outstanding conviction. Frey mentions these factors 
                in passing, but mainly attributes his recovery to willpower.</span></p>
              <p><span class="vbr12">&quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot; could 
                be part of the softening-up campaign for the switch toward treatment 
                rather than punishment. Venereal disease prevention in Paris in 
                the 17th Century eventually led to the criminalization of prostitution. 
                Now the high cost of drug criminalization results in the need 
                to declare recreational drug use or self-medication to be symptoms 
                of a treatable disease. Unfortunately, the involuntary treatment 
                model as currently formatted is merely another take on criminalization. 
                It's a lot better than jail for abusers of dangerous addictive 
                drugs such as crack, cocaine, speed and heroin, but how many people 
                would need treatment for marijuana dependency except to avoid 
                prison?</span></p>
              <p><span class="vbr12">The cost of scorched earth drug enforcement 
                is distorting the entire criminal justice system so ferociously 
                that government financial administrators at all levels are hard 
                put to pay for it. Just as the mentally ill were turned out on 
                the streets because it was so much cheaper, outpatient therapy 
                enforced by the threat of imprisonment will now replace the war 
                on drugs, at least for middle class whites. It probably won't 
                work, but it doesn't use weapons resources that would better go 
                to conventional wars of conquest.</span></p>
