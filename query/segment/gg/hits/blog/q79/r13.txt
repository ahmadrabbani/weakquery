When I approached the drive through speaker, I was told that the person will be right back with me. After 4-5 minutes of waiting at the speaker, with no sound from the SubWays person, I pulled over to the drive through window. There was nobody near by, except for a couple of people serving the front desk. I waited at that window for a while, while customers at the front desk looked back at me, but not even once did any of the Subways employees turned around or looked at that window, so I drove away. Sadly to say this is not the first time. My son used to stop at that SubWays on the way to work in the morning (It is a perfect location for people on the way to work), but he stopped doing that as he stated that this SubWays has the slowest service of any one he has ever been to. My other son used to work for Taco bell, when was in his teens, and he said that Taco bell’s policy was that the drive through has first priority for service... I ended up going to a Los Betos, where I got TWO breakfast burritos, in 3 minutes, for a price of one foot long breakfast sandwich.... I wonder how much business has been lost in your location due to total disregard to the drive through    (0)   COMMENTS   WRITE A COMMENT  (0)   PHOTOS   (0)   VIDEOS    REPORT ABUSE       Photos:  Video:        nehama    written: 3 Reviews posted: Thursday, Sep 2 7:47am I have tried to use the drive through window this morning, on the Thonydale / Orange Grove location.
