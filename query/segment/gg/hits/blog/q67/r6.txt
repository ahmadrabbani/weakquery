The Commission on Human Rights for decades was considered to be the central architect of the work of the United Nations in the field of human rights. Delegates from its 53 member States, together with those of observer States and non-governmental organizations, met in March/April of each year in regular sessions in Geneva, though special sessions were sometimes held at other times to deal with urgent and acute human rights situations. It was assisted in this work by the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, a number of working groups and a network of individual experts, representatives and special rapporteurs mandated to report to it on specific issues or countries. At its regular sessions, the Commission adopted resolutions, decisions and statements on matters of relevance to individuals in all regions and circumstances.  Website:
