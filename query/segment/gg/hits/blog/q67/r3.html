<p>Human rights are fundamental to the United Nations.  The Preamble of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">Charter of the United Nations</a> states that "We the peoples of the United Nations [are] determined... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small."</p>

<p>One of the early acts of the General Assembly was to draft and adopt the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/Language.aspx?LangID=eng">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (resolution <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/RES/217(III)&Lang=E&Area=Resolution">217 A</a> of 10 December 1948).  The <a href="http://www.un.org/law/avl/">Audiovisual Library of International Law</a> provides an introduction to the declaration and its impact, a procedural history, and citation to the key documents.  For the 60th anniversary, the UN libraries digitized the documents related to its drafting; these are available through a <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/udhr/">dedicated website</a> as well as through the <a href="http://documents.un.org/">Official Document System</a> (ODS) and <a href="http://unbisnet.un.org/">UNBISnet</a>, the library's catalogue. </p>

<p>More recent UN actions include the adoption of international human rights treaties, the creation of the position of <a href="#ohchr">United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> in 1993 and the establishment of the <a href="#council">Human Rights Council</a> in 2006. </p> 

<p>During its 60th session, the General Assembly adopted the World Summit Outcome, resolution <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/RES/60/1&Lang=E">60/1</a> of September 2005, which called, inter alia, for strengthening of the UN's human rights mechanisms.  Reform of the human rights mechanisms is ongoing and the documentation is changing to reflect the changes.  This guide provides an overview of current practice, as well as guidance on the historical documentation.</p><br> </font></td></tr>

The Organization's work in human rights is carried out by a number of bodies. When researching human rights issues, a distinction must be made between Charter-based and treaty-based human rights bodies. </p><p>
<a href="#charter">Charter-based bodies</a>: 
<ul>
<li>derive their establishment from provisions contained in the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">Charter of the United Nations</a>, </li>
<li>hold broad human rights mandates, </li>
<li>address an unlimited audience, and </li>
<li>take action based on majority voting.</li></ul></p>
<p><a href="#treaty">Treaty-based bodies</a>: 
<ul>
<li>derive their existence from provisions contained in a specific legal instrument,</li>
<li>hold more narrow mandates (i.e., the set of issues codified in the legal instrument),</li>
<li>address a limited audience (i.e., only those countries that have ratified the legal instrument), and</li>
<li>base their decision-making on consensus.</li>

<p>General UN documents databases, such as the <a href="http://documents.un.org">Official Document System</a> (ODS) and the library's catalogue, <a href="http://unbisnet.un.org">UNBISnet</a>, provide access to the full-text.</p>

<li>annual and sessional reports of committees and commissions; </li>
<li>reports periodically/irregularly issued such as of special rapporteurs, independent experts, working groups, or missions to countries. </li></ul>

The Council meets in regular session three times annually and in special session as needed, and reports to the General Assembly.  </p>

<p>Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, "Institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights Council", sets out the main mechanisms and subsidiary bodies of the Council; General Assembly resolution 62/219 of 22 December 2007, inter alia, endorses the decision of the Human Rights Council to adopt resolution 5/1.

Several UN human rights conventions establish monitoring bodies to oversee the implementation of the treaty provisions.  The treaty bodies are composed of independent experts and meet to consider States parties' reports as well as individual complaints or communications.  They may also publish general comments on the treaties they oversee. The treaty-based bodies tend to follow similar patterns of documentation.  </p><p>
The Secretary-General issues a Compilation of guidelines on the form and content of reports to be submitted by States parties to the international human rights treaties (<a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=HRI/GEN/2/Rev.6&Lang=E">HRI/GEN/2/Rev.6</a>).  This document provides details on the reporting requirements, including the core document, and treaty-specific documents. </p><p>
The documents of the treaty-based bodies are available in several places.   </p><p>
General UN documents databases, such as the <a href="http://documents.un.org">Official Document System</a> (ODS) and the librarys catalogue, <a href="http://unbisnet.un.org">UNBISnet</a>, provide access to the full-text.  </p><p> 
<a href="http://lib-unique.un.org/lib/unique.nsf">UN-I-QUE</a>, UN Info Quest, provides citation to selected types of documents.  Each record within UN-I-QUE is presented in reverse chronological order and is historically comprehensive.  This database focuses on documents and publications of a recurrent nature, such as:  <ul>
<li>sessional reports of committees; </li>
<li>periodic reports of the states parties.</li></ul></p>
<p>In addition, specialized human rights document databases have been developed, including the <a href="http://tb.ohchr.org/default.aspx">treaty-based body database</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.universalhumanrightsindex.org/">Universal Human Rights Index</a>. </p><p>
Information about the treaties, including the texts and current status, is available from the <a href="http://treaties.un.org/">UN Treaty Collection</a> and from the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/treaty/index.htm">OHCHR treaty-body</a> Website.  The historic archives section of the <a href="http://www.un.org/law/avl/">Audiovisual Library of International Law</a> provides a growing number of scholarly essays on the human rights conventions, their impact, procedural history, and key documents from the drafting process.  </p>
