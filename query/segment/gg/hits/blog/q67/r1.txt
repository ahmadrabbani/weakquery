Composed of 53 States members, its brief expanded over time to allow it to respond to the whole range of human rights problems and it set standards to govern the conduct of States. It also acted as a forum where countries large and small, non-governmental groups and human rights defenders from around the world voiced their concerns.  During its regular annual session in Geneva, for which over 3,000 delegates from member and observer States and from non-governmental organizations participated, the Commission adopted about a hundred resolutions, decisions and Chairperson's statements on matters of relevance to individuals in all regions and circumstances. It was assisted in this work by the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, a number of working groups and a network of individual experts, representatives and rapporteurs mandated to report to it on specific issues.       62nd SESSION     First meeting of the 62nd Session, 16 January 2006    Documentation Agenda Orders of the day Resolution Audio files of CHR 62     INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS     For NGOs     NEWS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS    Press releases CD-ROM on CHR 61                                                                                      © OHCHR 1996-2007  Site map    Contact us
