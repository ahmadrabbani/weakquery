The Preamble of the  Charter of the United Nations states that "We the peoples of the United Nations [are] determined... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small." One of the early acts of the General Assembly was to draft and adopt the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights (resolution  217 A of 10 December 1948). The  Audiovisual Library of International Law provides an introduction to the declaration and its impact, a procedural history, and citation to the key documents. For the 60th anniversary, the UN libraries digitized the documents related to its drafting; these are available through a  dedicated website as well as through the  Official Document System (ODS) and  UNBISnet , the library's catalogue.  More recent UN actions include the adoption of international human rights treaties, the creation of the position of  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in 1993 and the establishment of the  Human Rights Council in 2006.  During its 60th session, the General Assembly adopted the World Summit Outcome, resolution  60/1 of September 2005, which called, inter alia, for strengthening of the UN's human rights mechanisms. Reform of the human rights mechanisms is ongoing and the documentation is changing to reflect the changes. This guide provides an overview of current practice, as well as guidance on the historical documentation.          United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights      By resolution  48/141 of 20 December 1993, the General Assembly created the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The  Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights provides secretariat support for all UN human rights bodies and maintains the specialized human rights document databases, including,  Charter-based bodies database ; Treaty body database ; Universal Human Rights Index ; Universal Periodic Review .   The High Commissioner reports to the General Assembly annually on the activities carried out by the Office of the High Commissioner. This report is issued as Supplement No. 36 to the Official Records of the General Assembly ( list of symbols ). Statements made by the High Commissioner can be retrieved through the  OHCHR Media Centre . The Office of the High Commissioner also administers the  communications/complaints procedures available under the various human rights bodies.            Human Rights Bodies      The Organization's work in human rights is carried out by a number of bodies. When researching human rights issues, a distinction must be made between Charter-based and treaty-based human rights bodies.  Charter-based bodies :  derive their establishment from provisions contained in the  Charter of the United Nations ,  hold broad human rights mandates,  address an unlimited audience, and  take action based on majority voting.   Treaty-based bodies :  derive their existence from provisions contained in a specific legal instrument, hold more narrow mandates (i.e., the set of issues codified in the legal instrument), address a limited audience (i.e., only those countries that have ratified the legal instrument), and base their decision-making on consensus.            Charter-based bodies        The current Charter-based bodies are the  Human Rights Council and its subsidiaries, including the  Universal Periodic Review Working Group , and the  Advisory Committee . Previously, the Charter-based bodies were the  Commission on Human Rights and its subsidiaries, including the  Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights . The documents of the Charter-based bodies are available in several places. General UN documents databases, such as the  Official Document System (ODS) and the library's catalogue,  UNBISnet , provide access to the full-text. UN-I-QUE , UN Info Quest, provides citation to selected types of documents. Each record within UN-I-QUE is presented in reverse chronological order and is historically comprehensive. This database focuses on documents and publications of a recurrent nature, such as:  annual and sessional reports of committees and commissions;  reports periodically/irregularly issued such as of special rapporteurs, independent experts, working groups, or missions to countries.   In addition, specialized human rights document databases have been developed, including the  Charter-based bodies database and the  Universal Human Rights Index .        Human Rights Council (2006- )   The  Human Rights Council was established by General Assembly resolution  60/251 of 15 March 2006. The Human Rights Council is the successor of the  Commission on Human Rights . The Council meets in regular session three times annually and in special session as needed, and reports to the General Assembly.  Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, "Institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights Council", sets out the main mechanisms and subsidiary bodies of the Council; General Assembly resolution 62/219 of 22 December 2007, inter alia, endorses the decision of the Human Rights Council to adopt resolution 5/1. The text of Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 is found in its report to the General Assembly for its 5th session ( A/62/53 ).  Working documents are issued under the series symbol A/HRC/-. Summary records of meetings are issued under the series symbol A/HRC/[session]/SR.[meeting number]. As of 2011, preparation of summary records has been postponed indefinitely (see para. 2.56(a) of  A/66/6 (Sect.2) ). Summary records were prepared from the 1st (2006) to the 6th (2007) sessions. Unofficial meeting summaries may be found in Press Releases from the  UN Office at Geneva News and Media and the  OHCHR Media Centre websites.   The sessional reports are published initially as A/HRC/- documents. An annual cumulation covering all sessions for a year is later issued as Supplement 53 to the Official Records of the General Assembly ( list of symbols ). The reports provide summaries of the work concluded and contain the texts of resolutions and decisions adopted by the Council.  Resolutions and decisions are not released as separate documents but may be retrieved as individual items through the  Charter-based bodies database .  UN Headquarters press releases for the Council, issued under the series symbol HRC/-, are accessible through the search option at the  Press Releases website. Other press releases may be available through the  UN Office at Geneva News and Media site and the  OHCHR Media Centre .        Universal Periodic Review Working Group (2007- )   General Assembly resolution  60/251 of 15 March 2006, which established the Human Rights Council, mandates a universal periodic review of each state's fulfillment of its human rights obligations and commitments. Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, �Institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights Council,� sets out the main elements of the universal periodic review.  The  Universal Periodic Review Working Group holds three sessions per year. At each session, sixteen countries are reviewed, resulting in a four year-cycle to complete review of all 192 member states of the UN.  Working documents are issued under the series symbol A/HRC/WG.6/[session]/[country abbreviation]/-. The Working Group issues a report for each country which summarizes the meetings held and includes conclusions or recommendations. As of June 2009, the Working Group has not issued a sessional report that covers all the activities of the Working Group during the course of one session.  The OHCHR has developed a special  database for the documentation related to the universal periodic review.         Human Rights Council Advisory Committee (2007- )   The  Human Rights Council Advisory Committee was established by Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007. The Advisory Committee is composed of 18 experts serving in their personal capacity and functions as a think-tank for the Council. The Advisory Committee supercedes the  Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights . Working documents are issued under the series symbol A/HRC/AC/[session]/-. The sessional reports carry a double symbol A/HRC/- and A/HRC/AC- ( list of symbols ). The reports contain the texts of recommendations and provide brief summaries of the meetings.  Press releases from the  UN Office at Geneva News and Media site provide summaries of the statements made in meetings of the Advisory Committee. The  OHCHR Media Centre also issues press releases related to the work of the Advisory Committee.          Special Procedures (1947- )   The  Human Rights Council has responsibility for the  special procedures , including those originally established by the  Commission on Human Rights . The special procedures include special rapporteurs, special representatives, independent experts, and working groups, that investigate, discuss, and report on specific human rights issues under a  country mandate or  thematic mandate .  The series symbol under which special procedure documents are issued may vary. They may report on the topic to a principal organ, the Human Rights Council, or to a subsidiary body.  UN-I-QUE provides comprehensive lists of the reports issued (e.g.  reports of the Working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances ).  Since 2006, documents of the special procedures are generally issued under the series symbol A/HRC/-. Prior to 2006, documents were usually issued under the series symbol E/CN.4/- or E/CN.4/Sub.2/-. Since 1994, the special procedures have met annually as a group. The report of this meeting is transmitted by a note of the High Commissioner ( list of symbols ).         Commission on Human Rights (1946-2006)   The  Commission on Human Rights was established by Economic and Social Council resolution  5 (I) of 16 February 1946. The Commission met in annual and, when required, special sessions and reported to the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The Commission on Human Rights concluded its 62nd and final session on 27 March 2006; its work is continued by the  Human Rights Council . Working documents were issued under the series symbol E/CN.4/-.  Summary records of meetings were issued under the series symbol E/CN.4/[year]/SR.[meeting number]. The sessional reports carried a double symbol (series E/- and E/CN.4/-) and were published as Supplements to the Official Records of the Economic and Social Council ( list of symbols ). They provide summaries of the work concluded and contain the texts of resolutions and decisions adopted by the Commission. Resolutions and decisions were not released as separate documents in paper format but some may be retrieved as individual items through the  Charter-based bodies database .  UN Headquarters press releases for the Commission, issued under the series symbol HR/CN/-, are accessible through the search option at the  Press Releases website. Other press releases may be available through the  UN Office at Geneva News and Media site and the  OHCHR Media Centre .         Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (1947-2006)   The  Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights was established by the  Commission on Human Rights under the authority of Economic and Social Council resolution  9 (II) of 21 June 1946. The name was changed from Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities by ECOSOC decision 1999/256 of 27 July 1999. The work of the Subcommission is continued by the  Human Rights Council Advisory Committee . The Subcommission met in annual sessions from 1947-2006 ( list of symbols ). Prior to 19 June 2006, the Subcommission reported to the  Commission on Human Rights ; its final report was submitted to the  Human Rights Council .  Working documents were issued under the series symbol E/CN.4/Sub.2/-. The working documents of the final session were issued under the series symbol A/HRC/Sub.1/-.  Summary records were issued under the series symbol E/CN.4/Sub.2/[year]/SR.[meeting number]. The summary records of the meetings of the final session were issued under the series symbol A/HRC/Sub.1/[session]/SR.[meeting number].  The sessional reports carried a double symbol: series E/CN.4/- and E/CN.4/Sub.2/- ( list of symbols ). They provide summaries of the work concluded and contain the text of resolutions and decisions adopted by the Subcommission.  Resolutions and decisions were not released as separate documents in paper format but some may be retrieved as individual items through the  Charter-based bodies database .  UN Headquarters press releases for the Subcommission, issued under the series symbol HR/CN/-, are accessible through the search option at the  Press Releases website. Other press releases may be available through the  UN Office at Geneva News and Media site and the  OHCHR Media Centre .  Many reports were presented to the Subcommission by  special procedures , such as working groups and special rapporteurs.            Treaty-based bodies      Several UN human rights conventions establish monitoring bodies to oversee the implementation of the treaty provisions. The treaty bodies are composed of independent experts and meet to consider States parties' reports as well as individual complaints or communications. They may also publish general comments on the treaties they oversee. The treaty-based bodies tend to follow similar patterns of documentation.  The Secretary-General issues a �Compilation of guidelines on the form and content of reports to be submitted by States parties to the international human rights treaties� ( HRI/GEN/2/Rev.6 ). This document provides details on the reporting requirements, including the core document, and treaty-specific documents.  The documents of the treaty-based bodies are available in several places.  General UN documents databases, such as the  Official Document System (ODS) and the library�s catalogue,  UNBISnet , provide access to the full-text.  UN-I-QUE , UN Info Quest, provides citation to selected types of documents. Each record within UN-I-QUE is presented in reverse chronological order and is historically comprehensive. This database focuses on documents and publications of a recurrent nature, such as:  sessional reports of committees;  periodic reports of the states parties.   In addition, specialized human rights document databases have been developed, including the  treaty-based body database and the  Universal Human Rights Index .  Information about the treaties, including the texts and current status, is available from the  UN Treaty Collection and from the  OHCHR treaty-body Website. The historic archives section of the  Audiovisual Library of International Law provides a growing number of scholarly essays on the human rights conventions, their impact, procedural history, and key documents from the drafting process.
