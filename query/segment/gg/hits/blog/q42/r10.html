After Laurier stepped down, the Liberal Party made King leader in 1919. He was Prime Minister from 1921 until his defeat in 1930. He triumphantly returned to office in 1935 and served until 1948. <span style="font-weight: bold;">As a wartime leader, he negotiated the issue of conscription, Quebec’s involvement in the conflict and Canada’s participation with the Allied Forces</span>.

Pearson received his BA from U of T in 1919. Pearson began attending <a title="Victoria College Website" href="http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/home.htm" target="_blank">Victoria College</a> in 1913. When the war began, he was too young for military service, but was assigned to drilling with the Officers Training Corps. After enlisting in April 1915, he was sent overseas with the Canadian Army Medical Corps. In 1918, he returned to Canada.</p><p>Upon his return to Toronto, Pearson continued his studies at U of T and earned a degree in <a title="History Department Website" href="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/history/" target="_blank">History</a> in 1919. In 1923, following two years at Oxford, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pearson joined the History Department at U of T, lecturing in Modern History</span>. After receiving high marks in the Government Foreign Service examination, Pearson began a career in the Department of External Affairs. In 1942 he was appointed the second-in-command at Canada House, where he coordinated military supply and refugee issues, serving under High Commissioner Vincent Massey. His next role was as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Canada’s Ambassador to the United States, from 1945-1948</span>.</p>       <p>In 1948, Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent appointed Pearson Minister of External Affairs in the Liberal government. Shortly afterward, he won a seat in the Canadian House of Commons. From 1952 – 1953, Pearson was the president of the 7th session of the United Nations General Assembly and played an important role in formulating the UN Charter. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In 1957, for his role in defusing the Suez Crisis through the United Nations, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</span></p>       <p>In 1959 Pearson was elected leader of the Liberal Party and in 1963 Pearson was elected as the 14th Prime Minister of Canada, a position he held until 1968.

He was first elected federally in 1988. Mr. Martin was sworn in as Federal Finance Minister in November 1993 and he served in that role until June 2002. During his time in this office, Canada recorded five consecutive budget surpluses, erased a $42 billion deficit, paid down debt, and put in place the largest tax cuts in Canadian history. </p>       <p>As Prime Minister, a position he held from December 2003 to February 2006, Martin succeeded in negotiating a ten year, $41 billion dollar plan to improve health care and reduce wait times. He signed agreements with all provinces to establish a national early learning and child care program. Under his leadership the Canadian Government, in November 2005,  reached an historic consensus with Canada's provinces, territories, First Nations, Métis and Inuit people that would eliminate the gaps between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians in the areas of health, education, housing and economic opportunity. It became known as the Kelowna Accord.</p>       <p>While still Canada’s Finance Minister, Martin was named inaugural chair of the G-20, an international group of finance ministers and Central Bank governors, composed of the G-7 nations and emerging market nations. He is respected internationally in part for his leadership working to forge a new global financial order.   </p>       <p>Currently Martin co-chairs, with Nobel Laureate Wangari Maathai, a $100 million poverty alleviation fund for the Congo Rainforest Basin.  Domestically, he is leading a new initiative, in cooperation with local business communities and departments of education, designed to help Canadian Aboriginal youth complete high school.</p><p>Before entering politics, he had a distinguished career in the private sector as a business executive at Power Corporation of Canada in Montreal and as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Canada Steamship Lines.  </p>       <p>Martin studied philosophy and history at <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/stmikes/" title="St. Michael's College Website" target="_blank">St. Michael's College</a> at the University of Toronto and is a graduate of the University of Toronto <a href="http://www.law.utoronto.ca/" title="Faculty of Law Website" target="_blank">Law School</a>.

Meighen was born and raised in Ontario.  He received his B.A. in <a href="http://www.math.utoronto.ca" title="Department of Mathematics website" target="_blank">Mathematics</a> from the University of Toronto in 1896.  While a student at U of T, he met and began a rivalry with William Lyon Mackenize King – a rivalry which would continue throughout their political careers.</p>       <p>After graduating from U of T, Meighen went on to earn a Law Degree at Osgoode Hall Law School.  In 1908, he was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada.  He was made Solicitor General from 1913 – 1917, when he became the Minister of Mines and Secretary of State for Canada.  During his time in this role, Meighen was largely responsible for conscription.  Following his appointment as Secretary of State, Meighen became the Minister of Interior and Superintendent for Indian Affairs, during which time he steered Parliament through the creation of the largest piece of legislation ever enacted in the British Empire, creating the Canadian National Railway.  Meighen is also noted for his role in ending the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919, when he was the acting Minister of Justice.</p>       <p>Meighen was elected Prime Minister of Canada in 1920, and he served until December 1921, when he was defeated by Mackenzie King’s Liberal Party.  King and the Liberals were plagued by accusations of corruption and scandal, and lost power in 1925, with King retaining a hold on his Prime Minister seat until 1926.  Meighen served again as Prime Minister from June to September of 1926, when he was beaten by King and the Liberals, and Meighen then resigned as leader of the Conservative Party. </p>       <p>Meighen was appointed to the Senate in 1932, and was a Leader of the Government and Minister Without Portfolio from 1932 – 1935.  In 1942 he campaigned in a by-election in Toronto for the seat of York South and was defeated, at which point he withdrew from public life.  He died in 1960 at the age of 86, at which point he was a record-holder as the Canadian Prime Minister with the longest retirement, 33 years.</p>     </div>   </li>   <li><img src="/Assets/Strategic+Communications+Digital+Assets/This+is+U+of+T/graduates+2009/publicLifeAndLeadership/Clarkson$!2c+Adrienne.jpg" alt="" />     <div>       <h4>The Right Honourable Adrienne Clarkson</h4>       <h5>26th Governor General of Canada</h5>       <p>Adrienne Clarkson is a two-time U of T graduate, having earned her Bachelor’s Degree in 1960 and Master’s Degree in <a title="English Department Website" href="http://www.utoronto.ca/english/" target="_blank">English Literature</a> in 1962.
