After our regular panelists have their say, you can join in the debate, live on our website, with Andrew Coyne.  From 10 to 11 p.m. ET, Andrew will be sharing more of his opinions, and reading and responding to yours. So watch the panel tonight, then sign in to our  CoverItLive webchat to participate.  We're looking forwarding to hearing from you.
