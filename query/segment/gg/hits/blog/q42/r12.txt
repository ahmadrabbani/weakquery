 Hinchey's Store: Andrew Coyne And The Blind Side Of 'Coyne-servatism...'

                                   Hinchey's Store    'Fight for your opinions, but do not believe that they contain the whole or the only truth.' - Charles Anderson Dana (1819-1897)                                                            Monday, March 15, 2010   Andrew Coyne And The Blind Side Of 'Coyne-servatism...'    I've been reading a lot about Andrew Coyne's positions lately. He certainly doesn't seem like a fan of Stephen Harper. But it also doesn't look like he's much of a fan of anyone else in Parliament, as evidenced by his latest in  Maclean's ... It’s a funny thing. Minority parliaments are supposed to be unstable. Yet such is the pusillanimity on both sides that this one looks set to run and run. So long as he doesn’t actually do anything, Harper can govern as long as he likes. So my question is this - Andrew, if you think that Stephen Harper would be doing the country a favour by moving to implement what some might call 'True Conservative' initiatives, do you really think the country would be better served by embroiling it in unnecessary elections every three months?  What I mean by that is if the Conservative Government was putting poison pills into every piece of legislation they proposed, and the Opposition had to vote it down each time, as they are wont to do when right-leaning ideas are put forth, where would we be? Would we not be in a constant state of flux, moving from one confidence vote to the next?  As long as the Opposition is hamstrung, this minority Parliament has the consistency of a majority. The same can't be said about 'conservatives' trying to punish the CPC for a little pragmatism. Getting frustrated here serves no purpose - it just points to a lack of understanding as to what running a Canadian Government means. There are many to appease, and we can't always get what we want. That's how I see it, how about you?

In any next election, Harper will be asking Canadians to elect a majority Conservative gov't to implement the Budget and necessary cuts to gov't spending... all unhindered by the opposition parties. Charest asked Quebecers for the same thing and got his majority in 2009.  Canadians will get 4 years of electoral peace if they elect a majority gov't .. guaranteed. Ignatieff is not credible enough to ask for a Liberal majority gov't with him a PM of Canada. The only way Iggy can be PM is to form a pre-election coalition with the NDP. If the new Liberal policy platform is a NDP-approved platform, we may see a strategic voting coalition in the next election. That's the only way the Left can knock off Harper.

March 15, 2010 12:05 PM                Ted Betts said...  Coyne's point is that there is zero evidence that (1) Harper has even tried to do anything conservative including in this budget of "restraint" that increases spending in 2010-2011 even more than they had planned to increase spending in the last budget, and (2) the opposition would topple the government for any reason let alone a fiscally prudent or fiscally conservative budget.  In other words, Harper has never tried to do anything conservative - in fact, he has always done just the opposite - so there is no reason to claim he is conservative or to blame it on a minority government.    March 15, 2010 12:44 PM                Hinchey's Store said...  Ted - That's funny, because a few years ago, everyone was freaking out that Stephen Harper might gain power. Why were they freaking out? Because he was TOO conservative. So now he's not conservative enough? Make up your minds, people! My bet is that he's figured out how to keep a minority government rolling (if not stagnating), and is waiting for the rest of the country to realize that the Opposition can't do anything even remotely as well as they are doing it (say what you will, but which current leader of a party could or would be doing better? Gilles?) - with the hope of gaining a majority come next election, so the Opposition can sit on the sidelines with little to no power for a while. It would look good on them - Conservatives have sat on the sidelines long enough in our country's storied history!    March 15, 2010 1:01 PM               optimus2861 said...  "everyone was freaking out that Stephen Harper might gain power. Why were they freaking out? Because he was TOO conservative. So now he's not conservative enough? Make up your minds, people!" So the argument to tell conservatives to pipe down is, Harper is not being conservative because it will scare the electorate into not voting for him. We conservatives are then supposed to believe that, upon being given his precious majority, Harper will revert to being the conservative that he truly is/wants to be. Which means .. the Liberals will have been right all along? Harper really does have the dreaded "hidden agenda"? Everything he's done so far is just posturing, biding time, concealing his true colors? I don't know if that's ironic or pathetic.    March 15, 2010 1:52 PM               dupmar said...  So which is it, Observant or Anonymous ... As for Ted, if Harper has never tried to do anything conservative, I don't know what your problem is with him then ... you would think you'd be claiming him as one of your own and rallying behind him ...    March 15, 2010 2:05 PM                Ted Betts said...  Dupmar: Just because he's not doing anything conservative does not mean he IS doing he opposite.  In fact, I have a lot of problems with the way he runs government, deals with non-supporters, represents the nation, avoids accountability, blocks accountability and transparency, deals with the civil service, deals with premiers, and so on. None of which has much to do with being conservative or liberal. Frankly, my biggest issue with him these days is that he does... nothing of significance. He has made a mess of many small things and some big things for todays politics that will have to be cleaned up by someone else. Let alone the costs and deficits he doesn't want to do anything about. As a historian, I keep wondering what Canadians will write about him in the future, what his legacy was, if he were to step down right now. Other than bringing conservatives back from the wilderness - a feat of importance and true significance and something decidedly good for Canadian democracy - what has he accomplished? In fact, what of significance has he even tried to accomplish?  There is no shortage of significant issues to address - environment, health care, aboriginal policy, deficits/debt, Afghanistan/foreign defence policy or even the many social conservative issues like abortion, gay marriage, gay adoption - but he avoids them all or at least avoids making any decision about any of them. In fact, other than deciding to break his promise about income trusts (a promise that was reckless to make in the first place), has Harper made any tough decision in 4 years?    March 15, 2010 2:17 PM                Hinchey's Store said...  Optimus - no, the argument is that no matter which way Harper governs, the Opposition takes all positions on it, so they can either try and take credit or damn the Prime Minister. Either way, they can't make up their minds as to what they (you?) want from he and his policies. It's a given that any Party leader would want a majority as opposed to a minority - that argument doesn't wash either. The Liberal's have been both right and wrong all along, because the angle and approach keeps changing. You can't be all over the map. How's that for ironic and/or pathetic?    March 15, 2010 2:18 PM               dupmar said...  Ted, Some might prefer the excitement of life in the fast lane, an activist government that shakes things up, more riveting than TV dramas. You want that, you can vote NDP, or an NDP-Liberal coalition such as Trudeau gave us or the one that Dion sought to foist on us, with the Bloc a noisy backseat driver. Others prefer slow and steady, perhaps a rather uneventful trip, but much more certain to get you safely to destination...    March 15, 2010 2:39 PM                Ted Betts said...  Dupmar: I'm not looking for an activist government, just one that can show leadership and make tough decisions. Harper ain't it. He complained and complained and whined and whined while in opposition about many things. So it's not like he doesn't have issues. But staying in power is clearly more important to him than leading and making difficult choices. Take health care for example. A "fast lane, an activist government that shakes things up" and is "more riveting than TV dramas", isn't what is needed. But some vision, leadership, decisiveness and guts, is. Which is why nothing is being done on the healthcare front. Same with the structural deficit Harper created. A "fast lane, an activist government that shakes things up" and is "more riveting than TV dramas", isn't what is needed. But some vision, leadership, decisiveness and guts, is. Which is why our deficit spending  increases this year and increases  more than was project in last year's budget. It's not an  activist government Canadians want. It is an  active government we want.    March 15, 2010 2:48 PM                Ted Betts said...

Hinchey, why are you having an argument with Liberals about the definition of Conservative and whether or not our conservative PM fits the definition? Ted Betts is the last person I will be looking to consult when I fill out my Stephen Harper fiscal conservatism report card. I am happy that our Prime Minister has been willing to make compromises to ensure that neither Stephane Dion or Mike Ignatieff become Prime Minister. You are wasting your time if you think that you can have a meaningful conversation with these goofs.    March 15, 2010 2:52 PM                Hinchey's Store said...  Hey Ice - I'm not trying to convert the guy!  It's my blog, and I will defend my assertions when they are challenged. I don't think it's a waste of time to defend what I believe. What better avenue than my own arrogant blog, where I control what message I'm sending? : ) That being said, it's very clear that you and I are satisfied with Mr. Harper's performance and pragmatic conservatism in general. And there's nothing wrong with defending that position, which we do with virtually everything we post.    March 15, 2010 3:02 PM                Ted Betts said...  Hinchey: I respect your position that Harper is doing OK and for not censoring civil and reasonable comments (unlike our friend Iceman here).  I do question your claim that Harper is being pragmatically conservative though. I really don't see anything fiscally conservative in any decision he has ever made as PM. Not one. On the contrary, when given the choice, he has spent  more than Liberals or Progressive Conservatives ever have and been more fiscally impractical even reckless.  It is certainly fair to say that you continue to support him because you  think he would be better than any alternative. I suspect most people vote against the political alternatives as well. But that is, of course, entirely speculative and subjective and, even then, being a better alternative doesn't make him a fiscal conservative.    March 15, 2010 3:09 PM                Spin Assassin said...  Interesting. You know reading these guys and listening to Goodale's warbling I get the idea that Liberals are actually think of going conservative. They would have the hyper-conservatives backing them up. LOL Do people forget Liberals are all lies while no country is ever conservative enough for some people? Anyway, the hidden agenda is that the Canadian people and their economy come first and always. Balancing the books comes later whether the backseat theorists like it or not.    March 15, 2010 3:37 PM                Hinchey's Store said...  Ted - I'm lucky in that I haven't had to censor anybody yet. I expect it will come in time though. And Iceman has a bigger readership than I, and as such, likely attracts a lot more censor-able traffic. I've seen you on other blogs, and so far, you've given me a bit of respect, of which I will return to you. To me, a pragmatist is one who deals in reality. As endearing as it may be to stick blindly to one's principles in the face of overwhelming evidence that in a given situation, such principles might require a compromise, I frequently support the compromise. As for Harper being a fiscal conservative, I don't think he is, at least not to the extent that Mr. Coyne would like. Finally, a better alternative? Yeah, I think he is - can you give me an example of who you'd choose? The roster on the Left doesn't give me much to be afraid of...    March 15, 2010 3:47 PM                Hinchey's Store said...  Upon reading that last comment of mine, I should clarify a couple of things- There are certain principles that should always be stood by. Others can be more malleable. And the roster on the Left gives me lots to be afraid of (if they ever got into power that is)!    March 15, 2010 6:55 PM               wilson said...  I only got as far as Ted saying 'Frankly, my biggest issue with him these days is that he does... nothing of significance.' and I quit reading, all of his preachy posts here. Because if there is one thing you CAN say about PMSH, he as made a difference in the way other countries and Canadians think about Canada. Respect and national pride. He gave us back self respect and gave us premission to wear our patriotism on the outside. And that is very very significant Ted.    March 15, 2010 9:54 PM               Escaped MB, shine off BC said...  Right on Bec! I believe it was in the comments of the National Post that summed it up best. There is a continual bating by the left that "Stephen Harper is doing anything" or isn't "conservative" enough, some fall for it. Good to see the "hidden agenda" come out! LOL! People are smokin' BC bud if they think change can happen over night or even in 3 years when: 1. This country has been brainwashed for 13 years.  2. A high percentage of the civil service and judiciary is left of centre, appointed by your opposition. 3. When your opposition controls the upper chamber. Sub questions:  a) How many pieces of legistation have been put through in this minority b) How many would have passed if not for being stalled by the senate? As the saying goes patience is a virtue. Some are more so than others. With slow, steady leadership, the left of centre folk are coming back to the middle and hoping so does individual accountability. Then this country can really start rockin'. It has all the tools to do so.    March 15, 2010 11:16 PM                Ted Betts said...  Escaped: Actually, as we all now know, hardly any of Harper's legislation has been "blocked" or delayed by the senate. In fact, much of his crime legislation has been passed quicker in the senate than the House and most of the delays - including throwing out over half his legislative agenda - are attributable solely to Harper's actions or inactions. But I'll bite. You seem quite smitten by him. Tell me what he has done that has any lasting significance. I'll even help you out by giving you two: the very flawed but nonetheless better Federal Accountability Act and the first structural deficit in over a decade.  Everything else has been tinkering and more of that tinkering has been anti-conservative than conservative, especially when it comes to our finances.
