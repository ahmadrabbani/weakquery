Volunteer Company 10 Bravo is based in Wa’a Wa’a, which is small coastal community located on the Old Government Beach Road midway between the Hawaiian Beaches and Kapoho developments.We built a new firehouse at;14-372 Pakaka rd., Wa'a Wa'a subdivision<br> At the time of the Dana Ireland murder in 1991, Wa’a Wa’a was an isolated area and timely emergency services were not available.  In response to residents’ concerns that there was no emergency response organization in Wa’a Wa’a, Company 10-Bravo volunteer fire department was born.  We began with nine members, trained by Captain Lloyd Narimatsu and Sgt. Eddie Wong.  Over the years, we’ve had as many as 15 members, and at present we have ten.  We drive a GMC brush truck on loan from the U.S. Forestry Service.  Although it only carries 500 gallons of water, we have the equipment to draft from catchment tanks in Wa’a Wa’a.<br> Over the years, we’ve responded to a wide variety of calls ranging from Hawaiian Beaches to Kalapana.  Here in Wa’a Wa’a, we are often the first on scene if there is a medical emergency or fisherman in distress.  <br><br>Ten Bravo is a group with many talents.  Reva Collins, wife of one of our founding members, composed a song in honor of our dedication.  Here it is….ask any of us to sing it!<br><br>We are the Wa’a Wa’a volunteer<br>Firewomen and men<br>When they call us, they call us BRAVO TEN (we’re a ten)<br>We don’t want limp hoses<br>They won’t put out the fire<br>We don’t want limp hoses <br>As the flames are getting higher (higher, higher)<br>The Captain told us we would die like rats<br>We wear 30 pounds of clothing on our backs<br>We train and train and train some more<br>Saving lives and land is what it’s for<br><br>* * *<br>We’ve learned to use equipment and memorize codes<br>We’ve learned to work together to control a hose<br>We’ve learned how to haul somebody down a ladder<br>Saving lives and land it what really matters<br><br> * * *<br>Rebecca, John and Shelly<br>Dallas and Dean<br>Lui, Michael, Wesley and Bill are a team<br>Captain Narimatsu brought them through<br>He’s the volunteer fireperson’s guru!

Thanks to Shane store manager and the owners.<br>We basically support an area between Pahala including wood-valley to south-point, up to kapapala on hwy 11 to ocean-view. You got to respect the work these regular’s do, although I’ve inhaled my share of smoke.
