 Paper Dynamite Online: Stephane Dion Versus Andrew Coyne (And Me) On Senate Reform

      skip to main  |  skip to sidebar  Paper Dynamite Online   Blogging Beyond The News Cycle         Wednesday, July 13, 2011   Stephane Dion Versus Andrew Coyne (And Me) On Senate Reform   As far as substance goes,  Stephane Dion's op-ed on the Government's Senate reform package is unassailable. As a political document, however, it leaves a lot to be desired. The Liberal's Intergovernmental and Democratic Reform critic makes short work of Stephen Harper's proposed legislation to establish term limits and elect Senators. Three arguments dominate Dion's critique: 1) An elected Upper House with only six Senators each from Alberta and British Columbia would put these provinces at a legislative disadvantage in Ottawa. 2) Parliamentary gridlock would be much more commonplace. And 3) significant changes, like the ones proposed, require provincial approval, and will undoubtedly be ruled unconstitutional. Despite its sound reasoning and coherence, one is left feeling somewhat unsatisfied by Dion's laudable efforts to draw attention to the deficiencies of the pending legislation. Perhaps it's because the only thing that comes off looking worse than the legislation itself is the Senate as it's currently constituted; undemocratic, largely ineffective and with Western Canada woefully underrepresented. If the reform package is untenable and the status quo is similarly undesirable, a third option would have been a welcome addition to Dion's critique. Unfortunately he offers nothing in this regard. Indeed, Dion seems to quash any prospect for reform, when he laments the time, expense and divisiveness such an undertaking would entail. In contrast to Dion's preference for the stability of the status quo, Andrew Coyne makes a good case for the potential benefit a little turmoil could have toward achieving real Senate reform. Appearing on  the June 9 edition of CBC's At Issue Panel , Coyne said: Electing [Senators] creates a kind of useful chaos. That is to say, we've all become used to the idea, well it's a House full of bagmen that are appointed for life. And it's an outrageous situation but we've accustomized ourselves to it. If we had a [Upper] House that is half elected within eight or nine years - half elected and half appointed - that is intolerable and we will have to confront it, we will have to deal with it. I don't think there'd be any way around it. If Harper's reform package is seen from this vantage point - as part of a broader strategy to achieve meaningful reform - the merits of moving forward with the legislation are easier to grasp. As I've argued before ( here and  here ), it's likely Harper sees the current pieces of Senate reform legislation as part of an unfolding process toward more substantial changes to the Red Chamber. But to get there, pressure needs to build within the body politic (i.e. Court challenges) in order to justify constitutional negotiations or a referendum. With  70 percent of Canadians in favour of directly electing Senators , it would be wise for Liberals to do more than simply oppose Harper's reforms. Instead of putting up roadblocks, they'd be well advised to get out ahead of the Government on this issue. Advocating for  a referendum sooner rather than later would be a first step in this direction. Outlining  what a reformed Senate might potentially look like , and how it can function in a reinvigorated Parliament would be another. Notwithstanding the validity of Dion's arguments and his skepticism about the possibility of reform, the sight of Liberals opposing democratic reforms without proposing an alternative would be unseemly. And to their detriment it will not go unnoticed by voters. UPDATE: I just discovered that Andrew Coyne elaborated on his At Issue Panel comments in a July 4 column for Maclean's. From:  Our Upper House Of Ill Repute ... the Prime Minister’s proposals would almost certainly end in chaos. Perhaps that’s the point. The status quo of an appointed house is, remember, intolerable. And yet we have all learned to tolerate it, precisely because it is the status quo. But a half-elected, half-appointed Senate, a Senate beginning to use its powers notwithstanding its lopsided distribution, would be something entirely new. Then it would not just be intolerable: we would not tolerate it. Then it really would be a crisis, one that the country would have no choice but to deal with. Either, that is, the winner of the last three elections has entirely lost his mind, and is pursuing this mad adventure without any strategy for achieving it. Or he’s up to something. The alternatives the critics propose—either “do it properly,” with a round of negotiations among the premiers and a constitutional amendment, or “just abolish it”—are no less unrealistic, since they do not suggest how this process could even get under way, let alone be completed. I realize I am in danger of enrolling in the “he’s playing chess, while they’re playing checkers” school on Harper. But his previous prime ministerial missteps were either quickly abandoned, as with the national anthem, or had some obvious political upside, as with prorogation, that might at least explain, if not justify, his actions. (The long-form census fiasco remains, I concede, a puzzle.) The absence of a clear payoff to Senate reform, and yet his sustained and deliberate pursuit of it, suggests something else is at work. Perhaps he is attempting, as the Leninists would say, to advance the crisis, to make the intolerable no longer tolerated, to force us to confront what we have all grown rather too used to ignoring. (One difference between Coyne's take on this and mine is that I don't foresee this ever getting to a point of actually having half of the Senate elected. I believe Harper's strategic timeline is much shorter than that. Plus the fact that the Senate reform package is likely to be found unconstitutional means no one will ever be elected under these "laws". But we do agree that the deliberate creation of chaos/pressure is an integral part of Harper's strategy.)

Some Liberals have insisted for quite some time that they (the Liberal party that is) want senate reform. It is clear though that this is not so. The Libs appear divided on this issue as well. The party is a mess.
