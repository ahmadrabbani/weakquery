Friday's election Word of the Day is "endorsement." Politicians share their opinions Toronto Mayor  Rob Ford endorsed Conservative Leader Stephen Harper on Friday. The endorsement came as no surprise, given Ford's conservative leanings. "Rob Ford is endorsing Stephen Harper for prime minister,"  tweeted Julia Pereira . "Shocking." "An absolute stunner,"  joked James Onsuko . Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall hasn't endorsed any party, but said last week he's hoping to see a majority government. And Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi posted a video on Tuesday encouraging Canadians to vote -- but not endorsing any candidates. Papers pick parties The Globe and Mail published  its editorial endorsement on Wednesday, saying, "Stephen Harper and the Conservative Party are best positioned to guide Canada" into a new period of global ambition. The endorsement generated praise and criticism from Canadians. "Globe & Mail is free to endorse Harper's odious & dangerous gov't,"  tweeted Edward Fenner . "I am free to delete my G&M news feeds till they smarten up." "I don't think I've ever said it, but I agree with a good chunk of this editorial by the Globe and Mail,"  tweeted Holly Bacchus . The paper  held an online chat to discuss the reasons for its decision to endorse the Conservatives. The National Post  also endorsed the Conservatives on Thursday . Andrew Coyne, national editor of Maclean's magazine,  penned a column explaining why he intends to vote Liberal in this election. But,  he tweeted , "it's not quite an endorsement." Endorsements questioned Others think the practice of media outlets endorsing candidates or parties is inappropriate. "If you're a media entity, you should NOT be endorsing anyone in an election,"  tweeted Tommy Vallier . "Regardless of who I support, I'd unsubscribe for this." "Newspapers shouldn't endorse anyone,"  tweeted Kathryn Pugliese . "Fair and balanced' coverage? Ha." "Am I alone in thinking that newspapers shouldn't endorse political parties for the sake of journalistic integrity?"  tweeted Jeni Dawson .
