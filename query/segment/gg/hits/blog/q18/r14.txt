Because if she really is smart, than  this travel journal , in which she describes her love for Cuba and her affinity for Fidel Castro, reveals her to be an evil, vile person deserving of all contempt. No longer can she hide behind the memory of her fallen son. Read and the decide what she is: Dear Reader, How are you doing? I am writing this from an airplane speeding towards Mexico City at about 37,000 feet. I am heading towards my favorite place in the entire world, Cuba. Few USAians get to visit Cuba since the US blockade began in 1959, and I feel so fortunate to be on my 3rd trip down there. My way is being paid by an NGO in Cuba that I have worked with before. Cuba is a tropical island that is free of most of the grit, grime and pollution in the States, but also free of most of the crime in other tropical tourist destinations. I have rarely felt more safe than when I am in Cuba and one of my favorite things to do is sit out on a patio in the evening (after a day of meetings and such) sipping on a Mojito or other cold drink and feel the warm, sweet breeze blow over me. Just a few weeks ago, US President Obama was asked about the possibility of opening up talks with Cuba to help thaw the needless block of ice that has frozen diplomatic relations between our two countries. He answered: “Cuba has to change its society first!” Fidel Castro called him, “stupid,” and I agree with Fidel and here’s why. I would like US society to change the way Cuba’s society is. Besides providing every resident with a free and outstanding education through university and outstanding health care in a system that trains foreign doctors to work in economically and socially disadvantaged areas (yes, even Americans), the lifestyle is simpler and community is not just a concept, it’s a reality.
