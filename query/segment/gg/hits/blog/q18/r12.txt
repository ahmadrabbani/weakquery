Looks like Fed Prison is in my future. I would rather go to prison than fund the crimes of this government. I am going to send them a notice that they owe me infinity dollars for killing my son.” Sheehan has been an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq, and was one of the founders of Gold Star Families for Peace after her son Casey was killed in action in Iraq in 2004. The following year, she set up Camp Casey across the road from President George W. Bush’s ranch in Crawford, Texas, demanding a face-to-face meeting with him to discuss her concerns about the war.

On her  blog , Sheehan described how she had decided to stop paying taxes to fund the wars. "After I made this decision to become a tax resister (as an unemployed peace activist using her son’s rapidly diminishing life insurance money to fund her activism), I became very well known and desired on the college circuit and Simon and Schuster gave me an advance to write a book about my exploits," she wrote. "Still, most of the money I made for these services (minus living expenses and helping my children through tough times and school) went back into the movement. I never charged peace groups a stipend or for travel in those early years, and I traveled all over to receive many awards, which were really just an opportunity for groups to raise money most of the time. I didn’t care—I had money and money wasn’t important to me. Ending the wars was." She compared her tax situation to that of General Electric and other large multinational corporations and noted that she was being asked to pay more in taxes than GE.     2 Comments  Would the money spent on the movement, and to receive the awards to further the movement, be considered donations to a non-profit? the would reduce the amount owed. Assuming one was formed. Posted by: Tedego | September 9, 2011 3:34 PM Report this Comment  I am sorry that she is having trouble dealing with the loss of her son. Those of us who served in Iraq and other places, despite disagreements with misguided decisions by presidents, are embarrassed every time someone wastes ink on her cause. The military is today composed of an all-volunteer force, the draft having ended long ago. Cindy's shenanigans bring great discredit to the honorable service of brave and fiercely loyal volunteers. One of the hardest days of my life was attending a repatriation ceremony for seven special operators lost over a 96-hour period in early 2008 during the Surge. All seven died doing what they loved, serving their country. I like to think none of these seven were dishonored by funeral interuptions back at home.
