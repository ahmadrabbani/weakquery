 Adam Holland: Cindy Sheehan: bin Laden death was faked

                                   Adam Holland                                                             Monday, May 2, 2011   Cindy Sheehan: bin Laden death was faked    Cindy Sheehan has posted on Facebook that she believes Osama bin Laden's death to have been faked by the U.S. government. She writes:        Cindy Sheehan    I am sorry, but if you believe the newest death of OBL, you're stupid. Just think to yourself--they paraded Saddam's dead sons around to prove they were dead--why do you suppose they hastily buried this version of OBL at sea? This lying, murderous Empire can only exist with your brainwashed consent--just put your flags away and THINK!       (Source )    Update (5/2/11 2:45 pm):   As if the tastelessness of her initial post wasn't bad enough, Sheehan has added the following comment to it:          Cindy Sheehan       It's also easier just to swallow the lies of the Empire like Monica Lewinsky swallowed Clinton's sperm. It works for me.  about an hour ago  ·  Like   ·     2 people    Update (5/3/11 4:00 AM):    Sheehan has elaborated her views in a rambling blog post. More  here .

Cindy Sheehan has not only ignored Occam's Razor, but to paraphrase P.J. O'Rourke, she's thrown out Occam's entire shaving kit.    Monday, May 02, 2011          Anonymous said...  Well Cindy, I did stop to think, and I think you're still as bat-sh*t crazy as ever.    Tuesday, May 03, 2011           Mwalimu Daudi said...  Are we witnessing the start of a "Deather" movement? Will Mother Sheehan and others on the Far Left be demanding that Obama provide OBL's death certificate? And to think Mother Sheehan was once hailed as an "absolute moral authority" by Maureen Dowd and the rest of the media!    Tuesday, May 03, 2011          Anonymous said...  Thank you Cindy for being one of the few Americans with a 'thinking' brain - any American that swallows this propaganda is the reason why millions have died because of this despicable,racist Empire.

I agree with Cindy on everything, you know Foxnews reported that BL had died on 12-26-2001, and a lot of other sources has already said that BL has been dead for years. I believe it was a campaign stunt, a distraction....I will save all of you, who is going to protect us from him.( Obama) The young generation has been completely brainwashed, its the older ones or the baby boomers that realize what the fraud he has been and Bush too was also a fraud. God help us all. Don't give up Cindy, keep fighting, a lot more people believe what you say than you think, maybe someday the whole truth will come out?? Good Luck Cindy    Friday, May 06, 2011           Adam Holland said...  Agreeing with anyone about everything is a very dangerous proposition. So is citing Fox News as an authority. Let me ask you this: how many people are in on this conspiracy? The entire Obama administration? The Navy? Joint Chiefs of Staff? Pakistani military? Now al-Qaeda itself, since they announced bin-Laden's death today? Are they all involved in this massive conspiracy to reelect Obama? You must really love Cindy Sheehan if you can overlook all the obvious reasons what she says can't possibly be true.
