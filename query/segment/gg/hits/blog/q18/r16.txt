 Proof Positive: Cindy Sheehan Occupies Sacramento

      skip to main  |  skip to sidebar          Saturday, October 15, 2011   Cindy Sheehan Occupies Sacramento    ...with plans on getting arrested at midnight tonight.    Somehow believing her fifteen minutes of fame is not up yet*, Cindy Sheehan arrived in Sacramento to try to give her otherwise meaningless life some kind of meaning while she milks the crowd for as much attention as she can get. Back in  May of this year , she was protesting here, too. Noted peace activist Cindy Sheehan said Thursday she's "willing to be arrested" as part of a large protest planned for next week at the state Capitol. "I've never been arrested in California before," Sheehan said. And in case she's still waiting for that first California arrest, she plans on staying in Cesar Chavez park past the midnight curfew. SACRAMENTO, Calif . -- "Occupy Sacramento" expects more than 1,000 people Saturday to march to the Capitol and the downtown area. Arrests are expected in the evening. Organizers have been urging people to protest across the globe and across the country. Sacramento is just one of many cities joining the movement Saturday. Anti-war mom Cindy Sheehan will speak at 2 p.m. at Cesar Chavez Park. *Attention nit pickers (or knit pickers): one could say "are up", but since "fifteen minutes of fame" is commonly considered as a singular phenomenon, either is correct. You may now fixate on that to the exclusion of everything else I wrote.  Cross posted at  LCR ,  Say Anything .
