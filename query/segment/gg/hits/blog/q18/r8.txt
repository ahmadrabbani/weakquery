Del.icio.us  Facebook  Stumbleupon   Newsvine  Yahoo bookmarks  Mixx   Digg  Reddit  Google Bookmarks   Twitter  LinkedIn       (AP/Andrea Bruce, Washington Post)  On Tuesday, I  wrote about Cindy Sheehan's decision to step back from her role as perhaps the most widely known antiwar activist. Is it too soon to wonder if she's already getting a replacement? Maybe not. The story of antiwar Marine Sgt. Adam Kokesh and his compatriots sure seems like the kind of thing that could gather momentum as the summer heats up. Here's the deal: Kokesh is a photogenic Iraq veteran who has become something of an inside-the-beltway provacateur, stirring up trouble around Washington with stunts like roaming Washington in camouflage as if he was on patrol. The Marine Corps, not surprisingly, doesn't approve of his activities. The Corps is now calling Kokesh and two others before a hearing to potentially change his honorable discharge into an "other than honorable" one. (One of the men is being called forth for making disparaging remarks about the president.) The Cleveland Plain-Dealer  explains how, exactly, that's possible: It might seem odd that a veteran could be subject to such sanctions. But like hundreds of thousands of veterans who figured their service was over, Kokesh is subject to recall as a member of the Individual Ready Reserve, a category most soldiers and Marines fall in for a period after discharge. The IRR, which critics refer to as a "backdoor draft," provides a pool of troops that can be reactivated if needed…  On March 29, a Marine major sent him an e-mail to tell him he was being investigated for misconduct by appearing at a political event in uniform. Kokesh responded, telling the major what he thought, and using an expletive to do so. That resulted in an additional misconduct charge. IRR members, apparently, still have to follow Marine Corps rules, even though they are for all intents and purposes out of the Corps. Which means, it seems, that swearing just isn't allowed, along with sharing your opinion about the war in which you fought. Here's the money quote from the ACLU's Marv Johnson: "It seems like these guys were over in Iraq fighting for their country, and now they're being brought up on charges for exercising the free speech they were fighting for."  Wonkette  makes the Sheehan comparison, though perhaps a bit less charitably than we did: "Iraq veteran and honorably discharged Marine Sgt. Adam Kokesh has been the Pentagon's biggest public relations nightmare this year, because he's some kind of magical Cindy Sheehan — people actually like him!"   The VFW is  on Kokesh's side too : "Trying to hush up and punish fellow Americans for exercising the same democratic right we're trying to instill in Iraq is not what we're all about," said VFW head Gary Kurpius. "Someone in the Marine Corps needs to exercise a little common sense and put an end to this matter before it turns into a circus." The summer is a slow news period known for emotionally charged stories, and this one seems tailor made for a hungry press corps -- at least until the next Missing White Woman. The media-savvy Kokesh has a bus going from DC to his hearing in Kansas City and is holding a  press conference today after turning down a plea bargain offer from the Corps, which appears to be shifting into damage control mode. Ladies and gentleman, welcome to the big top.        Brian Montopoli  Brian Montopoli is the senior political reporter at CBSNews.com.

Not true. According to the Universal Code of Military Justice only regular forces are subject to court martial under UCMJ. "Members of a regular component of the armed forces, including those awaiting discharge after expiration of their terms of enlistment; volunteers from the time of their muster or acceptance into the armed forces; inductees from the time of their actual induction into the armed forces; and other persons lawfully called or ordered into, or to duty in or for training in the armed forces, from the dates when they are required by the terms of the call or order to obey it."  http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj.htm Of all the crimes that are being committed by military personal across the globe including genocide, murder, rape and torture you found a possible uniform violation. Way to go. America is so much safer now. Happy Memorial's Day to all the active duty and veterans especially the ones in proper uniform.

You go Kokesh !! Reply to this comment             by  helenuu  June 2, 2007 12:25 PM EDT  Let's hear it from the Democrats, especially Senator Kerry and Rep. Murtha. Every service person who has returned from the Bush debacle should have the right to express him/her self and still reap all the VA benefits. Reply to this comment             by  brianbwb-2009  June 2, 2007 8:46 AM EDT  to dukeanddoc And what part of the oath you quote has been violated? How about his Commander-in-chief, who, after swearing to &quot;uphold and protect the constitution of the USA&quot;, proceeded to and continues to violate almost every provision of said constitution? Do you posit that a soldier can violate the law because he was ordered to by his superior? Did not the precedents set by the Nuremburg trials, and Lt. Calley's My Lai massacre trials establish that &quot;just following orders&quot; is no defense... Reply to this comment             by  brianbwb-2009  June 2, 2007 8:38 AM EDT  to Mr. Dukeanddock, So when does the good captain violate orders he was never given? Did anyone say, &quot;go home, and don't protest the war, and that's an order&quot;? You write,&quot;By his actions the command involved will now have to pay special attention to Cpl Kokesh because Cpl Kokesh%u2019s intent is to hold the unit hostage.&quot; How do you presume to know anyones' intent other than your own? and, If this illegal war hadn't begun in the first place, there would be no need for MOBCOM (what a fitting name) to pay attention to him, now would there?  Reply to this comment             by  activejudge  June 2, 2007 4:42 AM EDT  It would be nothing new for the Republican Party, the Wingnut Gabfests, and anti-American crowd to make Adam Kokesh their new Cindy Sheehan. And nobody should have been the least bit suprised when Adam Kokesh had his fill of being a puppet of the Bush Adminstration, and turns on them, just like Cindy Sheehan did. Pick your heroes more carefully, Wingnuts. Reply to this comment             by  one_american  June 1, 2007 10:08 PM EDT  It would be nothing new for the Democrat Party, the Liberal Press, and anti-American crowd to make Adam Kokesh their new Cindy Sheehan. And nobody will be the least bit suprised when Adam Kokesh has had his fill of being a puppet of the Liberal Establishment, and turns on them, just like Cindy Sheehan did. Pick your heros more carefully, Liberals. Reply to this comment             by  dukeanddoc  June 1, 2007 7:59 PM EDT  Coporal Kokesh is still under contract in the Armed Forces of the United States. Yes, he is in inactive status and &quot;technically&quot; a civilian, but, contractually he is obligated to uphold the oath he took. It looks a little something like this: &quot;I, Adam Kokesh, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.&quot; Until he has his discharge document in hand (characterization unknown at this point), he is still bound to uphold his oath. He knows it and will have a hard time doing his tap-dance when called on the carpet. Reply to this comment             by  lindyb2  June 1, 2007 7:00 PM EDT  Corporal Kokesh obviously has some issues with the military busting his rank for returning home with an Iraqi weapon (illegal...and in violation of U.S. Military Code) as well as with upholding his commitment to the people of the United States to serve so many years active duty and so many years inactive duty. He is still a soldier and under the regulations of soldiers. Apparently, he has difficulty following orders. He is just a very lone voice, one of many Marines...who have little tolerance or respect for those who undermine their mission. It is unfortunate his lack of impulse control, his immaturity and inability to act in a dignified and rational manner required of his former rank have been exposed to the public. The positive aspect is he is not leading squadrons into the field and they are not having to rely on his judgment which is in question which is reassuring to the parents of Marines, families of Marines, loved ones of Marines and I am certain those Marines out in the field. I feel sorry for him, because he is young and reckless and I suspect will later regret his actions.

If &quot;investigating&quot; this is their job, then they're doing their job. If it isnt, then they're not doing their job. Sadly, it takes a lot of courage for a vet to dissent with any aspect of the American war machine. The First Amendment isnt about the freedom to exchange baking recipes - it's about the freedom to openly disagree, and to criticize what's HIS - in this case, HIS corp and HIS govt. More than a marine, Kokesh is a member of the American public. Show some respect for THAT. All your money and authority come from WE THE PEOPLE. Not God, not Bush, not Rumsfeld. *US*. The American military and govt have forgotten who their true masters are. Kokesh is reminding them.
