 BeggarsCanBeChoosers.com: Media Snoozed When Glenn Beck Called Cindy Sheehan a "Slut"

Wednesday, May 25, 2011   Media Snoozed When Glenn Beck Called Cindy Sheehan a "Slut"    By MARC McDONALD MSNBC host Ed Schultz has been  suspended for a week after he called conservative radio host Laura Ingraham a "right-wing slut." The episode has caused a huge uproar in both the mainstream media, as well as the right-wing blogosphere and talk radio. Ingraham herself has waded into the controversy by accusing Schultz of "misogyny." But how many people recall back in 2005  when Glenn Beck  called Cindy Sheehan a "slut"? Don't feel bad if you don't remember this. Unlike the uproar over Schultz's remark, the mainstream media snoozed when Beck called Sheehan a "slut." And of course, Ingraham was silent about her good buddy Beck's remark back in 2005. Beck faced absolutely no punishment or reprimand for his 2005 remark. Indeed, this episode is completely forgotten today. Since then, Beck has gone on to enjoy an astonishingly lucrative career. For example, in 2009 alone, he  pulled down a cool $32 million, mostly from his vast radio and publishing empire. The moral of this story, of course, is this: if you're a Republican, you can pretty much say anything you want these days (including  using violent rhetoric against Democratic politicians). But if you're a Democrat, you've got to be very careful and watch what you say---or you will be immediately punished, as Schultz found out. It's all just another sad example of the double standard that exists in public political discourse in this country.

Ingraham IS a stupid right-wing slut, and what Schultz called her was totally correct and deserved. SHE should be the one suspended, along with Michelle Mallkin, for their nonstop and unrelenting assaults on the President. Unfortunately, it's to be expected though, for after all, MSNBC is corporate-owned just like Fox and all the other mainstream media. What a pathetically spineless bunch. REINSTATE ED SCHULTZ NOW!!!!    11:04 AM             Anonymous said...  I read where Rick Perry has announced that he is considering a 2012 run. Early polling indicates that a Perry/Bachman ticket would crush Obama in the election. Read it and weep, Libtards!    4:05 AM           Post a Comment               Newer Post    Older Post   Home   Subscribe to:  Post Comments (Atom)      About This Blog Welcome to BeggarsCanBeChoosers.com, the progressive political blog of Marc McDonald.
