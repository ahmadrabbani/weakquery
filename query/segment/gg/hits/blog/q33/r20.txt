The 77-year-old suffered a mild stroke last month and close associates have said they do not expect him to return to office. His illness throws Israeli politics and diplomacy throughout the region into turmoil amid election campaigns for both the Palestinians and Israel. ·  Special report: Israel and the Middle East            December 1 1956  Ariel Sharon (c) with fellow Israeli soldiers following a military raid into Syria.
