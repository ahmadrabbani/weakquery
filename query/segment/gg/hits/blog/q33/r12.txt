Norman Finkelstein, on how Sharon courted Margalit: He sees this pretty girl and he cuts through a fence between his yard and her school to get to the other side. That's who he is. Direct." Source:  Jewish Ledger  Ariel Sharon, about Margalit: "It was while I was irrigating in our orange grove one day that I looked up and noticed a girl cultivating the vegetable field next to our property....I had never in my life seen anyone so beautiful."  Source: "Warrior", page 37  Ariel Sharon, on the loss of his son, Gur: "The pain is unending, impossible to heal."  Source: "People Weekly", 02-26-2001, p65+  Ariel Sharon, after the death of Gur: "Standing in front of the grave, I remembered five and a half years ago when we had buried Gali. I had given a brief talk then and it came back to me that I had said, "The only thing I can promise you is that I will take care of Gur." Now I could not shake the thought that I had not kept my promise. At such times one doesn't really think, but this kept coming back to me again and again. I didn't take care of him. I just didn't take care of him." Source: "Warrior", page 215    Ariel Sharon, about Lily: "Since Gali's death Lily had been a mother to Gur and our relationship had developed into one of deep love and strong friendship which was to profoundly affect the rest of my life." Source: "Warrior", page 168.    Uri Dan, about Lily:  "When Lily fell ill in February, 1999, Sharon experienced a third tragedy. But once again, Lily was at his side between treatments for cancer, encouraging him to continue the political struggle. When the illness got worse, Ariel returned to her every day, to her bedside in hospital, and in particular to sit beside her in the long nights, when she suffered such pain. I sometimes found him sitting there in an armchair next to her bed, after she had fallen asleep, with his head dropping, asleep. The fire that broke out because of an electrical short circuit in Ariel and Lily's home three months before she died, and destroyed the family nest she had built, gave Ariel's story a Jobian dimension." Source: "Jerusalem Post", 02-15-2002 Ariel Sharon, dedication of his autobiography: "To my wife, Lily, who has been with me through it all and whose love and support have been my inspiration and strength."  Source: "Warrior"    Ariel Sharon, commenting on Lily's grave: "In Spring, this place is all covered in bee-yoo-tiful flowers. One day, I will be buried here too, next to my wife."  Source:  The Guardian  Ariel Sharon, about his sons after corruption allegations filed against them: "But our family is very special. I think that Lily had a part in creating a special atmosphere inside the family. They are good friends, the boys, true friends. I am proud of them." Source:  Haaretz  Inbal Sharon, about Ariel: "He's a very loving grandfather, and the kids adore him. They jump on him and hug him. He's crazy about them. Even when they're wild and disturb him when he's trying to rest, he never complains. They like to watch soccer games on TV together. When there's no game on, Arik watches old classic films and Westerns, and the kids fall asleep in his bed."
