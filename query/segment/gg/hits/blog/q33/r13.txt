On January 4, 2006, Mr Sharon suffered a massive stroke and slipped into a coma from which he has never recovered, leaving behind him a gaping political vacuum.   The mass-circulation Yediot Aharonot reported on Wednesday that the necessary medical equipment had already been installed in Mr Sharon's 'Sycamore Farm,' his beloved retreat in southern Israel not far from the border with the Gaza Strip, and he would be moved there "within days."   Dr Rotstein, however, said the newspaper's report was premature.   "As of this moment I don't yet know that he is going home," he said. "I have not yet met with the Sharon family or their representatives."    He did say however that such a move was something the hospital has been advocating for more than a year and the hospital said in a separate statement on Wednesday that it hoped media reports of his imminent transfer would become reality "in the near future."  "This is something we should like to see, it's a move that we want," Rotstein told the radio.  "If I understand correctly, the idea is to take him for a weekend, see how they manage, bring him back (to the hospital) and in light of the experience to make a decision whether it's feasible or not," he added.  Mr Sharon, 82, collapsed five months after he embarked on a radical new path which saw him pulling out all Jewish settlers and soldiers from the Gaza Strip after 38 years of occupation.  Since then, however, peace efforts have led nowhere. At the end of 2008,   Israel  launched a devastating 22-day offensive in Gaza, during which the Palestinians severed all contact.  Fresh attempts to get the sides talking, which began six weeks ago, are now deadlocked by a dispute over Israeli settlements.
