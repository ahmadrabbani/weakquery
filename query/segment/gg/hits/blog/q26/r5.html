Her father, Avner Hershlag, is an Israeli doctor specializing in <!--del_lnk--> fertility and reproduction (<!--del_lnk--> reproductive endocrinology). Her mother, Shelley Stevens, is an American <!--del_lnk--> homemaker who now works as her <!--del_lnk--> agent. Portman&#39;s maternal ancestors were Jews from <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> and her paternal ancestors were Jews who immigrated to Israel from Poland and Romania. Her grandfather&#39;s parents died in <!--del_lnk--> Auschwitz and her Romanian-born great-grandmother was a spy for the British during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>.<p>Portman&#39;s parents met at a <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a> <!--del_lnk--> student centre at <!--del_lnk--> Ohio State University where Portman&#39;s mother was selling tickets. Portman&#39;s father returned to Israel, but the two corresponded and were married when Portman&#39;s mother visited Israel a few years later. When Portman was three years old, the family moved from Israel to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, where her father pursued his medical training. The family lived in <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> in 1984 where she attended <!--del_lnk--> Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School, relocated to <!--del_lnk--> Connecticut in 1988, and then settled permanently in <!--del_lnk--> Syosset, New York in 1990.<p>Portman has said that although she &quot;really love[s] the States... my heart&#39;s in Jerusalem. That&#39;s where I feel at home&quot;. Portman is an only child and very close to her parents, who are often seen with her at her film premieres.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h3>
      <p>Portman was a straight-A student.&quot;I&#39;d rather be smart than be a movie star,&quot; she told an interviewer. Although she says her family was not religious, she attended a Jewish elementary school, the <!--del_lnk--> Solomon Schechter Day School of <!--del_lnk--> Glen Cove, New York. She graduated from a public high school, <!--del_lnk--> Syosset High School. Portman reportedly skipped the premiere of <i>Star Wars: Episode I</i> so she could study for her high school final exams.<p>In June 2003, Portman graduated from <!--del_lnk--> Harvard University with a bachelor&#39;s degree in psychology, and pursued graduate studies at the <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew University of Jerusalem in the spring of 2004. At Harvard, Portman was <!--del_lnk--> Alan Dershowitz&#39;s research assistant (he thanks her in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Case for Israel</i>). She was also a research assistant in a psychology lab, and in March 2006, appeared as a guest lecturer at a <!--del_lnk--> Columbia University course in terrorism and counterterrorism, where she spoke about her film <i>V for Vendetta</i>.<p>In addition to being bilingual in <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>, Portman has studied <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Japanese, <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>.<p>As a student, Portman co-authored two research papers which were published in professional scientific journals. Her 1998 high school paper on the &quot;Enzymatic Production of Hydrogen&quot; was entered in the <!--del_lnk--> Intel Science Talent Search. In 2002, she contributed to a study on memory called &quot;Frontal Lobe Activation During Object Permanence&quot; during her psychology studies at Harvard.<p><a id="Career" name="Career"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Early_career" name="Early_career"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h3>
      <p>Portman started dancing lessons at the age of four. She performed in local troupes, and dreamed of dancing on <!--del_lnk--> Broadway. At the age of ten , Portman was discovered in a Long Island <!--del_lnk--> pizza parlor by an agent for <!--del_lnk--> Revlon, who offered her an opportunity to <!--del_lnk--> model. She turned down the opportunity in favour of acting. In a magazine interview, Portman said: &quot;I was definitely different from the other kids. I was more ambitious, I knew what I liked and what I wanted, and I worked very hard. I was a very serious kid.&quot;<p>As a child, Portman spent her <!--del_lnk--> school holidays attending theatre camps. When she was ten, she auditioned for <i>Ruthless!</i> about a girl who is prepared to commit murder to get the lead in a school play. She was chosen as the understudy for <a href="../../wp/b/Britney_Spears.htm" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a>.In 1994, she auditioned for <!--del_lnk--> Luc Besson&#39;s film <i><!--del_lnk--> L&eacute;on</i> (aka <i>The Professional</i>). She was initially turned down, but through further auditioning won the part. Soon after getting the part, she took &quot;Portman&quot;, her grandmother&#39;s maiden name, as her stage name, in the interest of privacy; in the <!--del_lnk--> Director&#39;s Cut of the film found on <a href="../../wp/d/DVD.htm" title="DVD">DVD</a> she is credited as Natalie Hershlag. In the film, Portman plays an orphaned girl who befriends a much older <!--del_lnk--> assassin. <i>L&eacute;on</i> opened on <!--del_lnk--> November 18, <a href="../../wp/1/1994.htm" title="1994">1994</a>, and marked her feature film debut at age 13. That same year she appeared in the short film <i><!--del_lnk--> Developing</i>, which aired on television. Starting at age thirteen, Portman spent her school holidays attending upscale theatre camps <!--del_lnk--> Stagedoor Manor and Usdan Camp, where she fell in love with acting, playing roles in camp productions such as the title character in <i><a href="../../wp/a/Anne_of_Green_Gables.htm" title="Anne of Green Gables">Anne of Green Gables</a></i>, Dream Laurey in <i><!--del_lnk--> Oklahoma!</i>, and Hermia in <i><!--del_lnk--> A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream</i>.<p><a name="1995.E2.80.931999"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">1995&ndash;1999</span></h3>
      <p>During the mid-<!--del_lnk--> 1990s, Portman had roles in the films <i><!--del_lnk--> Heat</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Everyone Says I Love You</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Mars Attacks!</i>, as well as a major role in <i><!--del_lnk--> Beautiful Girls</i>. In 1997, Portman played the role of <a href="../../wp/a/Anne_Frank.htm" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> in a <!--del_lnk--> Broadway adaptation of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Diary of Anne Frank</i>. She initially turned down the lead role in the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Anywhere But Here</i>, after learning it would involve a <!--del_lnk--> sex scene. Director <!--del_lnk--> Wayne Wang and actress <!--del_lnk--> Susan Sarandon demanded a rewrite of the script. Portman was shown a new draft, and she joined the project. The film opened in late 1999; she received a <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe nomination for <!--del_lnk--> Best Supporting Actress for her role as Ann August. Critic Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon commented on Portman&#39;s performance:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;Sarandon is good, but Portman is astonishing. Unlike any number of actresses her age, she&#39;s neither too maudlin nor too plucky. Her Ann is both a petulant wet blanket and a thoughtful, painfully lonely girl fumbling to find herself. Portman knows her character is the soul of the story, and she isn&#39;t overreaching about it. She portrays Ann&#39;s angst quietly, using her wide, expressive face to convey little ripples of frustration and exasperation. She&#39;s the counterpoint to Sarandon&#39;s bravado, and she keeps the film from becoming a hammy, anything-you-can-cry-I-can-cry-harder diva fest.&quot;</blockquote>
      <p>In the late <!--del_lnk--> 1990s, Portman was cast as <!--del_lnk--> Padm&eacute; Amidala in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/s/Star_Wars.htm" title="Prequel trilogy (Star Wars)"><i>Star Wars</i> prequel trilogy</a>, and in early 1999, <i><!--del_lnk--> Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i> opened and became the highest grossing film of the year and the second highest grossing film out of the <i>Star Wars</i> series. Its massive audience and mainstream appeal made Portman an instant star. Portman then signed on to play the lead role of a persevering teenaged mother in <i><!--del_lnk--> Where the Heart Is</i>.<p><a name="2000.E2.80.932005"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">2000&ndash;2005</span></h3>
      <p>After filming <i>Where the Heart Is</i>, Portman moved into the dorms of <!--del_lnk--> Harvard University to pursue her <!--del_lnk--> bachelor&#39;s degree in <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychology</a>. She said in a 1999 interview that, with the exception of the <i>Star Wars</i> prequels, she would not act for the next four years in order to concentrate on studying.<p>During the summer break, from June to September 2000, Portman filmed <i><!--del_lnk--> Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones</i> in <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> , including additional production in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. In July 2001, Portman opened in <!--del_lnk--> New York City&#39;s Public Theatre production of <!--del_lnk--> Chekhov&#39;s <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Seagull.htm" title="The Seagull">The Seagull</a></i>, directed by <!--del_lnk--> Mike Nichols, playing the role of Nina alongside <!--del_lnk--> Meryl Streep, <!--del_lnk--> Kevin Kline, and <!--del_lnk--> Philip Seymour Hoffman. The play opened at the <!--del_lnk--> Delacorte Theatre in <!--del_lnk--> Central Park. That same year, she was one of many celebrities who made <!--del_lnk--> cameo appearances in the comedy <i><!--del_lnk--> Zoolander</i>. In 2002, the film opened around the world. Portman was cast in a small role in the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Cold Mountain</i> alongside <!--del_lnk--> Jude Law and <!--del_lnk--> Nicole Kidman.<p>In 2004, Portman appeared in the independent movies <i><!--del_lnk--> Garden State</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Closer</i>. <i>Garden State</i> was an official selection of the <!--del_lnk--> Sundance Film Festival, and won Best First Feature at the <!--del_lnk--> Independent Spirit Awards. Her performance as Alice in <i>Closer</i> saw Portman win a Supporting Actress Golden Globe as well as a <!--del_lnk--> Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination.<p>2005 saw the worldwide release of the final <i>Star Wars</i> prequel, <i><!--del_lnk--> Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</i> on May 19. The film was the highest grossing film of the year, and was voted Favorite Motion Picture at the <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Choice Awards. Shortly before the film&#39;s opening, Portman shaved her head for her role in the film adaptation of <!--del_lnk--> Alan Moore&#39;s graphic novel, <i><!--del_lnk--> V for Vendetta</i>, released in March 2006. Her shaved head was first seen publicly at the <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> premieres. &quot;Making a dramatic change that isn&#39;t reversible is always a worthy experience,&quot; she said of the drastically different hairstyle, &quot;and that sort of gave me the courage to do it.&quot; She kept her hair short for most of 2005, had a <!--del_lnk--> fauxhawk, and briefly sported a full <!--del_lnk--> mohawk in late August, saying that it was &quot;kind of wonderful to throw vanity away for a bit&quot;. Also in 2005, Portman filmed <i><!--del_lnk--> Free Zone</i> and legendary director Milos Forman&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Goya&#39;s Ghosts</i>. Forman hadn&#39;t seen any of her work, but thought she looked like a <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/f/Francisco_Goya.htm" title="Goya">Goya</a> painting so he requested a meeting. During the filming of <i>Goya&#39;s Ghosts</i>, she partied in Madrid with co-star <!--del_lnk--> Javier Bardem, but was largely unrecognized due to her mohawk.<p><a name="2006.E2.80.93present"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">2006&ndash;present</span></h3>
      <p>Portman appeared on <i><!--del_lnk--> Saturday Night Live</i> on <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, hosting the show with musical guest <!--del_lnk--> Fall Out Boy and special guest star <!--del_lnk--> Dennis Haysbert. In a now-famous <!--del_lnk--> SNL Digital Short, she portrays herself as an angry <!--del_lnk--> gangsta rapper (with <!--del_lnk--> Andy Samberg as her <!--del_lnk--> Flava Flav-esque partner in <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Viking</a> garb) during a faux-interview with <!--del_lnk--> Chris Parnell, saying she cheated at Harvard University while high on <!--del_lnk--> pot and <!--del_lnk--> cocaine. In another sketch, she portrays a student named Rebecca Hershlag (her actual surname) attending a <!--del_lnk--> Bar Mitzvah, and in an installment of the recurring sketch The Needlers (also known as Sally and Dan, The Couple That Should Be Divorced), plays a fertility specialist (her father&#39;s profession).<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><i>V for Vendetta</i> opened in early 2006. Portman portrayed <!--del_lnk--> Evey Hammond, a young woman who is saved from the secret police by the main character, <!--del_lnk--> V. Portman worked with a voice coach for the role, learning to speak in an <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> accent, and had her head shaved. <!--del_lnk--> <i>Maxim</i> magazine named Portman #33 on its annual <!--del_lnk--> Hot 100 list, citing her <i>V for Vendetta</i> hairstyle as a huge accomplishment proving &quot;you don&#39;t need hair to be hot.&quot;<p>Portman has commented on <i>V for Vendetta&#39;</i>s political relevance, and mentioned that her character, who joins an underground anti-government group, is &quot;often bad and does things that you don&#39;t like&quot; and that &quot;Being from Israel was a reason I wanted to do this because <a href="../../wp/t/Terrorism.htm" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> and violence are such a daily part of my conversations since I was little.&quot; She said the film &quot;doesn&#39;t make clear good or bad statements. It respects the audience enough to take away their own opinion&quot;. Both <i><!--del_lnk--> Goya&#39;s Ghosts</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Free Zone</i> received limited releases in 2006. Portman starred in the children&#39;s film <i><!--del_lnk--> Mr. Magorium&#39;s Wonder Emporium</i>, which began filming in April 2006 and was released in November 2007; she has said that she was &quot;excited to do a kids&#39; movie.&quot; In late 2006, Portman filmed <i><!--del_lnk--> The Other Boleyn Girl</i>, a historical drama in which she plays <!--del_lnk--> Anne Boleyn; <!--del_lnk--> Eric Bana and <!--del_lnk--> Scarlett Johansson will co-star in the film. She was also named one of the hottest women of film and TV, by <i><!--del_lnk--> Blender</i> Magazine.<p>Filmed and screened in 2006 was <!--del_lnk--> Wong Kar-wai&#39;s road movie <i><!--del_lnk--> My Blueberry Nights</i>. Portman won acclaim for her role as gambler Leslie:<blockquote>
       <p>It&#39;s not until Portman shows up that you&#39;ll find the sort of sizzle and sympathy Wong cooks up with ease in his best films. Natalie Portman &mdash; Best Actress? Yup. For once she&#39;s not playing a waif or a child princess but a mature, full-bodied woman, probably a decade older than Portman is (25). She looks great, in a blond rinse and come-hither outfits, but she&#39;s not coasting on her looks; they are only accoutrements to Leslie&#39;s natural salesmanship. She uses her appeal to simultaneously flirt with and taunt the gambler across the table....But the memory we&#39;ll cherish is that of Portman&#39;s vibrancy, grittiness and ache, all performed with a virtuosa&#39;s easy assurance. She, not Jones, is the savory dish of movie magic in a mostly bland <i>Blueberry Nights</i>.</blockquote>
      <p>Portman had a small role in the 18th season of <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Simpsons.htm" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> as the voice of <!--del_lnk--> Bart Simpson&#39;s love interest, Darcy, from a neighboring town.

Recently, she was spotted with former male model <!--del_lnk--> Nathan Bogle at the U.S. Open on <!--del_lnk--> September 5, <!--del_lnk--> 2007.<p>When asked in a June 2002 <i><!--del_lnk--> Rolling Stone</i> interview whether she &quot;ever wondered, growing up, whether [she was] gay,&quot; she said: &quot;Sure. I&#39;ve never dated a woman or anything like that. But ... I think it&#39;s much more the person that you fall in love with &mdash; and why would you close yourself off to fifty percent of the people? ... I think my personality is more compatible with men than women.&quot;<p><a id="Beliefs" name="Beliefs"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Beliefs</span></h3>
      <p>Portman has been an advocate of <!--del_lnk--> environmental causes since the age of twelve, when she joined an environmental song and dance troupe. She has been a <!--del_lnk--> vegetarian since the age of eight, and at some point went further and became <!--del_lnk--> vegan.<p>Portman has spent some of her free time involved in causes such as the <!--del_lnk--> Democrats&#39; <!--del_lnk--> 2004 U.S. presidential campaign and ending poverty. In 2004 and 2005 she traveled to <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Guatemala.htm" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, and <a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> as the Ambassador of Hope for <!--del_lnk--> FINCA International, an organization that promotes <!--del_lnk--> micro-lending to help finance women-owned businesses in poor countries. In an interview conducted backstage at the <!--del_lnk--> Live 8 concert in <a href="../../wp/p/Philadelphia.htm" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and appearing on the <!--del_lnk--> PBS program <i><!--del_lnk--> Foreign Exchange with Fareed Zakaria</i> she discussed <!--del_lnk--> microfinance. Host <!--del_lnk--> Fareed Zakaria said that he was &quot;generally wary of celebrities with fashionable causes&quot;, but included the segment with Portman because &quot;she really knew her stuff&quot;. In the &quot;Voices&quot; segment of the April 29th, 2007 episode of the ABC Sunday Morning Program <i><!--del_lnk--> This Week with George Stephanopoulos</i>, Portman discussed her work with FINCA and how it can benefit women and their children in third world countries. In the Fall of 2007, Portman visited several university campuses, including Harvard, UCLA, UC Berkeley, Stanford, Princeton, New York University, and Columbia, to inspire students with the power of microfinance and to encourage them to join the <!--del_lnk--> Village Banking Campaign to help families and communities lift themselves out of poverty.<p>On the concept of the <!--del_lnk--> afterlife, she comments &quot;I don&#39;t believe in that. I believe this is it, and I believe it&#39;s the best way to live.&quot; She has said that she feels more Jewish in the Holy Land and that she would like to raise her children in the Jewish religion: &quot;A priority for me is definitely that I&#39;d like to raise my kids Jewish, but the ultimate thing is to have someone who is a good person and who is a partner... I get much more Jewish in Israel&quot;.<p><a id="Controversy" name="Controversy"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h3>
      <p>Portman, who had read <!--del_lnk--> W.E.B. Du Bois, was interviewed for the August 2004 issue of <i><!--del_lnk--> Allure</i> magazine where she was quoted as saying, &quot;Oh my God! I&#39;m not black, but I know what it feels like!&quot; She then wrote a letter to their editor, in which she wrote: &quot;The &#39;it&#39; I was referring to when I said, &#39;I know what it feels like,&#39; was not intended to signify that I know &#39;how black people feel,&#39; but rather that I know what DuBois&rsquo; concept of double-consciousness feels like, in variation. Had my quote included what I actually said preceding that statement, perhaps my meaning would have been clearer.&quot;<p>Portman also made headlines when she was moved away by <!--del_lnk--> Israeli Police on <!--del_lnk--> February 23, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 from <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Western Wall after protests by religious Jews who were praying at the holy site. She and Israeli actor <!--del_lnk--> Aki Avni were filming a kissing scene near the <!--del_lnk--> Western Wall for the movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Free Zone</i>. This was deemed to be &quot;immodest&quot; and men who were praying heckled the pair until police stepped in and suggested they return later. The site is under the authority of <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox Judaism, and Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch, who is responsible for the site, said the actors&#39; behaviour violated the code of conduct.<p>It was reported that on <!--del_lnk--> July 8, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Portman was pulled over by the <!--del_lnk--> NYPD while driving in a transit tunnel underneath <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> for looking unusual and having an expired registration. She had a shaven head from playing her role in <i>V for Vendetta</i>, and had just arrived back in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> from Israel and film shooting in Berlin. The policeman told her not to drive in the tunnel, but to take the bridge instead. &quot;I&#39;ve never had that happen to me before,&quot; Portman said. &quot;It&#39;s supposedly random... I didn&#39;t understand that logic. If you&#39;re a suspect, don&#39;t take the tunnel, take the bridge?&quot;<p><a id="Filmography" name="Filmography"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Filmography</span></h2>
