<b>Unit Description</b>

<p>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people are concerned about the possibility that the earth is getting warmer and

the effects this change might have on the earth's ecosystem. This unit includes classroom

activities to help students understand global warming and its possible effects on human

beings. Lessons in the unit provide students with opportunities to study global climate

changes, discuss and debate the current arguments for and against global warming and the

Greenhouse Effect, investigate the possibility of global warming and the Greenhouse

Effect, and present their findings in the form of research reports.

<b>Objectives</b>

<P>

Students will:

<UL>

<li>Learn about changes in global weather patterns and climate over long periods of time.<br>

<li>Study and debate the possibility of a Greenhouse Effect and its impact on the earth.<br>

<LI> Use the Greenhouse Effect Visualizer to understand possible greenhouse

effect changes. <BR>

<LI> Present their findings to the school (and others) by creating global warming

reports and presenting them at an earth day event.<BR>

<LI> Learn to use the Internet as a resource for research.<BR>

<b>Materials and Resources</b> 

<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing our lessons and activities, we made some

assumptions about the hardware 

and software that would be available in the classroom for teachers who visit the 

LETSNet Website. We assume that teachers using our Internet-based lessons or

activities have a computer 

(PC or Macintosh) with the necessary hardware components (mouse, keyboard, and 

monitor) as well as software (operating system, TCP/IP software, networking or

dial-up 

software, e-mail and a World Wide Web client program, preferably Netscape, but

perhaps 

Mosaic or Lynx). In the section below, we specify any &quot;special&quot;

hardware

or software 

requirements for a lesson or activity (in addition to those described above)

and the level of Internet access required to do the activity.



<OL>

<LI> 

<b>Special hardware requirements:</b> None.



<LI> 

<b>Special software requirements:</b> None.



<LI> <b>Internet access:</b> Medium-speed (28,000

BPS via modem), or High-speed (greater than 1 MBPS via network). 

It should be noted that medium and high speed connections are

preferable for viewing Web pages on the Internet.

<b>Unit Lesson Plans</b>

<P>



<OL>

<LI><a href="b5u1l1.html">Lesson One: Introduction to Global Warming</a>.

This lesson uses traditional and on-line resources to introduce students to basic 

information on global climate and atmospheric changes over time. <BR>   

<P>

<LI><A HREF="b5u1l2.html">Lesson Two:  The Greenhouse Effect Debate</A>.  Students discuss

and debate the possibility of a Greenhouse Effect and its possible impact on the earth.

<P>

<LI><A HREF="b5u1l3.html">Lesson Three:  The Greenhouse Effect Visualizer</A>.  

Students work in groups using the Greenhouse Effect Visualizer, and other available on-line

visualization tools, to study global climate changes looking for evidence for and against

global warming and the Greenhouse Effect. <p>



<li><a href="b5u1l4.html">Lesson Four: Writing and Editing a Research Report on Global Warming</a>.

Following their research, students write and peer edit reports on global warming and

the Greenhouse Effect. Students are encouraged to read and make suggestions 

for improving reports of students who adopt different positions on global warming. <p>



<li><a href="b5u1l5.html">Lesson Five: Presentation to the School</a>.

 Following the first four lessons, a special school earth day is planned 

where students present their research reports, along with any 

other associated products (models, diagrams, Web-pages, etc.) to the rest of the class and school.

<B>Relation to Standards</B>

<p>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Global Warming unit contains activities that encourage and support student 

learning about science, especially weather and global patterns. In developing these 

lessons, we have considered the science <a href="b5u1stan.html">standards</A> of the National 

Academy of Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The Global Warming Unit also

supports classroom activities in the area of language arts that conform to standards in 

writing and editing. <BR>

<b>One Computer versus Many</b>

<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plans for this unit are tailored to fit teaching

situations where students

have access to several computers with an Internet connection.  To accommodate

classrooms

that do not have access to a computer lab with full Internet connections,

students can

work in research groups to explore Internet sites and conduct their research.

<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have only one computer with Internet access, you

may

choose to do one of the following:

<P> 

<ul>

        <LI>If you have the technology, you may hook-up the computer to a TV

monitor or

LCD projector.  This will allow the whole class to see sites in the preliminary

stages when students are exploring sites created by other children.

<P>

        <LI>You may choose to have

students rotate through computer with Internet access in groups.

<P>

        <LI>You may also download files from the Internet and save them to a

disk. Then transfer <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com"

>Netscape</A>

[http://home.netscape.com] onto your other computers.  Now you can transfer the

files you down-loaded and saved to a disk to the other non-internet computers to

view with Netscape. 

This will not allow students to explore the pages with hyper-links, but they will

be able to access and view the information by opening each file with Netscape.
