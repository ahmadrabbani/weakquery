The study indicates far less future global warming will occur than United Nations computer models have predicted, and supports prior studies indicating increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide trap far less heat than alarmists have claimed. Study co-author  Dr. Roy Spencer , a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and U.S. Science Team Leader for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer flying on NASA's Aqua satellite, reports that real-world data from NASA's Terra satellite contradict multiple assumptions fed into alarmist computer models.   "The satellite observations suggest there is much more energy lost to space during and after warming than the climate models show," Spencer said in a July 26 University of Alabama  press release . "There is a huge discrepancy between the data and the forecasts that is especially big over the oceans." In addition to finding that far less heat is being trapped than alarmist computer models have predicted, the NASA satellite data show the atmosphere begins shedding heat into space long before United Nations computer models predicted. The new findings are extremely important and should dramatically alter the global warming debate. Scientists on all sides of the global warming debate are in general agreement about how much heat is being directly trapped by human emissions of carbon dioxide (the answer is "not much"). However, the single most important issue in the global warming debate is whether  carbon dioxide emissions will indirectly trap far more heat by causing large increases in atmospheric humidity and  cirrus clouds . Alarmist computer models assume human carbon dioxide emissions indirectly cause substantial increases in atmospheric humidity and cirrus clouds (each of which are very effective at trapping heat), but real-world data have long shown that carbon dioxide emissions are not causing as much atmospheric humidity and cirrus clouds as the alarmist computer models have predicted. The new NASA Terra satellite data are consistent with long-term NOAA and NASA data indicating atmospheric humidity and cirrus clouds are not increasing in the manner predicted by alarmist computer models. The Terra satellite data also support data collected by NASA's ERBS satellite showing far more longwave radiation (and thus, heat) escaped into space between 1985 and 1999 than alarmist computer models  had predicted . Together, the NASA ERBS and Terra satellite data show that for 25 years and counting, carbon dioxide emissions have directly and indirectly trapped far less heat than alarmist computer models have predicted. In short, the central premise of alarmist  global warming theory is that carbon dioxide emissions should be directly and indirectly trapping a certain amount of heat in the earth's atmosphere and preventing it from escaping into space. Real-world measurements, however, show far less heat is being trapped in the earth's atmosphere than the alarmist computer models predict, and far more heat is escaping into space than the alarmist computer models predict. When objective NASA satellite data, reported in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, show a "huge discrepancy" between alarmist  climate models and real-world facts, climate scientists, the media and our elected officials would be wise to take notice. Whether or not they do so will tell us a great deal about how honest the purveyors of global warming alarmism truly are. James M.

F. Bacon    3 months ago   Wish news indicated who their sources represent. Those with an agenda hide behind obscure names and titles.           John    3 months ago   How many of you have looked up the Heartland Institutes writing on second hand smoke, all they did was point out that a Federal Judge said that the proponents ( Cremona) cherry picked the study's. Sort of like Lawyers who falsely convict people by hiding all the evidence. They did not make a judgement. That's up to you to do......but for some reason many of you do not want people to actually make up their own minds. I usually find that comes from people who are too lazy to actually read something, believe everything they see on TV or have an issue with their ability to analyze things. So here's to you "logically challenged" person. Never let the facts get in the way and enjoy your Bud Light.           .    3 months ago   INTELLIGENT DESIGN is irrefutable evidence of the evolution of stupidity.           john    3 months ago   I'm not an 'Alarmist' by a long shot, but the article really just says that the observed data does not match the model data, making the findings harder to work with, and they don't know why.           Peter    3 months ago   To Al Gore and the rest of the #$%$ who were trying to make everybody freak out about Global Warming, NASA just blew your story sky high! So I guess it really doesn't matter how much gas Livestock emit just by FARTING does it? Our impact on so called Global Warming or Climate Change has just been proven to be NIL! NASA just proved that YOU'RE FULL OF #$%$ AL! HA!           Jesus4jberg    3 months ago   This is so funny! Now that we are having some serious heat waves moving across the land; the truth comes out. Hmm. You would've thought this would be out in the winter.           Gary    3 months ago   Don't let the facts get in the way of your political opinion...           Texan    3 months ago   Well it sure is hot here in Texas. Anyone else wish the earth would release even MORE heat? I could use a day or two below 100 degrees just to catch my breath. At 7am here it was 85 degrees and 90% humidity. I don't see much heat being release... And Mr. Taylor, please learn some words other than "alarmist" - it made your article a drag to read.           Carrie    3 months ago   Full Disclosure: James M. Taylor is senior fellow for environment policy at The Heartland Institute and managing editor of Environment & Climate News. The Heartland Institute is a libertarian public policy think tank that focuses on (among other things) questioning the scientific consensus on climate change. "Environment & Climate News" is a newsletter published by the Heartland Institute. The writer of this article works for a political organization that seeks to discredit the science on climate change. That's a pretty big conflict of interest. Get an independent, neutral third party to write this article--not a politician who has already made up his made about climate change.           Benjamin    3 months ago   It's easy to figure out why it's happening, Earth has it's own cycle thing, It's get hot, and It's get cold. every billion years. last time it was hot, dinasours around. that's how they find the bones up to north pole and south pole. When it get cold, ice land around. We are just starting go into hot stage for another billion years. after that cold stage for another billion years. all planets are not just a ball of rocks, they are alive. metorites are from dead planets           Zaphod    3 months ago   NOAA water temp measurements also showed a slight decrease in average ocean temps a couple of years ago. Another story the MSM "missed".           RICHARD    3 months ago   I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE EXPERTS HERE. 1) HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT VIKINGS FARMED ON GREENLAND? HENCE THE NAME...GREENLAND. 2) HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN ANCIENT VESSELS EXCAVATED NEAR OSTIA ANTICA, WHICH WAS FOUNDED 2500 YEARS AGO AND WAS ROME'S FIRST COLONY? THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT INDICATES THE COASTLINE DURING THE ANCIENT ROMAN DAYS WAS SOME 3 TO 4 KILOMETERS (2.5 MILES) FARTHER INLAND THAN IT IS NOW. WONDER HOW THE HECK THAT HAPPENED?

Richard Cappetto    3 months ago   The UN commissioned to major studies on Global warming and both determined that the SUN is 99% responsible for Global Warming and Cooling. WHAT you have never heard this? Of course not the UN won;t release the data, they do not like the conclusion. People the elites who run this world want to find a reason to CUT DOWN the Human population, so they will blame Global Warming on HUMANS.           Michael F    3 months ago   Does anyone remember acid rain back in the 70´s?           Pat Patterson    3 months ago   Patrick J Patterson Algore just commented that since NASA has been defunded and kicked out of the USA their data can no longer be trusted. Calling for the UN to act now to retain the heat that is escaping the atmosphere or everything could "freeze up" within 10 years and Polar Bears will be in Florida.           Pat Patterson    3 months ago   Mein alarm ist kaput!           Blackwater    3 months ago   Global warming is a hoax. Every thinking human being has known this instinctively from the start. It was invented by fascist democrats as yet another way to grow government, control everyone's lives even more, raise taxes, and of course, funnel those tax dollars to their corporate cronies at companies like General Electric.  Everyone who has ever pushed the global warming agenda should be thrown in prison for the rest of their lives, and their money confiscated and given back to the American people who have been ripped off. Al Gore should be tried and executed.
