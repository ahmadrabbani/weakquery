<p>[Note from the author (December 2009): Hello everyone. &nbsp;Although I wrote this article quite some time ago, it appears to be receiving many views and is still topical. &nbsp;My thoughts on this subject have been refined somewhat since I wrote this, and I would now be better able to articulate the subject, but I am keeping this article here for the sake of the thousands of readers per month this is still getting. &nbsp;I have updated the images as most of them had dead links, but otherwise I will leave the original article intact for history. &nbsp;Thanks for reading!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://imgur.com/8mCow.jpg" alt="Al Gore" width="400" height="287" /></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [</em><em>Fig 1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>These days it is well nigh impossible to not be aware of the 'Global Warming' hysteria.&nbsp; From the doomsday movies, to alarming media headlines, to politicians scrambling over each other to get on the green bandwagon, one thing is clear - it&rsquo;s not politically correct to question it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first decided to look into what all the fuss was about on climate change, I was not opinionated on the subject at all.&nbsp; From what I understood then, the only difference between the global warming alarmists and me was a difference in opinion on the economics involved.&nbsp; That has now completely changed.</p>
<p>They have engaged in exaggeration and deception on just about every single last aspect of climate change.&nbsp; In fact, the only thing I can really confirm for you is that carbon dioxide has a 'greenhouse effect' in our atmosphere, and we are responsible for 0.28% of it [6].&nbsp; Actually, even the word "greenhouse" is misleading because that implies a restriction on convection currents, which is not physically accurate.&nbsp; The moon doesn&rsquo;t have an atmosphere and experiences an average surface temperature of 107&deg;C and -153&deg;C for day and night respectively, which is obviously a much larger range compared to Earth's.&nbsp; The best explanation for how an atmosphere's "greenhouse" effect acts, is it increases the planet's heat capacity (i.e. it holds more energy and thus takes longer to heat up and cool down) and thus makes the climate more gentle and hospitable.</p>
<p>But let's step back for a moment from the atmosphere and talk about Earth's historical and current temperatures. Global warming alarmists would have us believe that we are now seeing a global temperature at a height not achieved for a very long time.&nbsp; This is simply not true.&nbsp; We have seen temperatures even within the last 1,000 years higher than our present, which is not even a blip in Earth&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Possibly the most infamous display of this garbage is the "hockey-stick graph"<em>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em><img src="http://imgur.com/UgrWS.gif" alt="" /><br /></em></p>
<p>Although Mann <em>et al</em> compiled it in 1998, it was not until 2003 that the first independent person was able to look at the algorithms used in the graph, because they refused to release it.&nbsp; It turned out that, even using completely randomized data, one could create a graph that looked exactly the same because the algorithms had a bias to exaggerate the last century!&nbsp; Not only that, but it should be obvious from the fact that the Vikings were settling and farming Greenland from the 9<sup>th</sup> to the 13<sup>th</sup> century, in places now covered with permafrost and ice, that this graph is just total nonsense!&nbsp; Of course, this was not before the graph had been used as the backdrop for the 2001 UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.&nbsp; You would have thought that was a pretty good indication of their scientific integrity, but I promise you it gets much, much worse.&nbsp; Perhaps even more interesting than the inability of the IPCC to verify its data before using it at all, let alone as a centerpiece, or subsequently apologising after it became public how fraudulent the graph was, is the fact that environmentalists to this day still use this graph to illustrate their points.&nbsp; Al Gore's entire sensationalist "documentary" (boy is that charitable) revolves around this widely discredited graph and others like it.&nbsp; It should honestly occur to us that anyone who continues to use this graph to support their arguements has little interest in actually presenting reality.&nbsp; The IPCC used to publish the real temperature data on the past millennium in its earlier reports, but not anymore because it&rsquo;s an inconvenient truth to their agenda.</p>
<p>What about recent temperature rises in the last century?&nbsp; Surely it is impossible to deny that we are seeing warming now at an unusual and alarming rate?&nbsp; Well, you'd be surprised.&nbsp; Measuring Earth's average temperature to any interesting degree of precision is a considerably complex task.&nbsp; Even defining exactly what the absolute surface air temperature means is challenging, giving plenty of room for pursuing an agenda.&nbsp; The vast majority of graphs you've seen on this subject will have come from data using land-based measurements, as these allow the graph to continue back beyond the 1970s.&nbsp; There are numerous problems with land-based measurements, ranging from the fact that land only accounts for 30% of the planet's surface, to urban heat islands and other effects from changes in local land use.&nbsp; Dr. Dick Morgan, former advisor to the World Meteorological Organization and climatology researcher at University of Exeter, U.K. says, [7] "Had the IPCC used the standard parameter for climate change (the 30 year average) and used an equal area projection, instead of the Mercator (the 2D representation of a sphere which exaggerates the polar area) warming and cooling would have been almost in balance."&nbsp; However, in the last 30 years we've had consistent measurements from weather balloons and satellites, which produce much more reliable results for obvious reasons, and what we've observed from this equipment is a only a very slight warming trend.&nbsp; This data should be puzzling to the people who built the climate models for the IPCC, because they actually predicted the reverse - the troposphere should be warming faster than the surface if the current warming is due to the 'greenhouse effect'.</p>
<p>While we're on the subject of climate models, I'd like to say a few things.&nbsp; Climate models are in their infancy.&nbsp; They are highly dependent on the assumptions that go into them, and there are a lot of them.&nbsp; In fact, there are so many assumptions and parameters that it is genuinely possible to create any relationship you like. Climate models are made fun by the inclusion of "positive feed-backs" (multiplier effects) so that a small temperature increment expected from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide invokes large increases in water vapor, which seem to produce exponential rather than logarithmic temperature response to CO<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp; It seems to have become somewhat of a game to see who can add in the most creative feedback mechanisms to produce the scariest warming scenarios from their models, but there remains no evidence that the planet behaves in such a manner.&nbsp; Not only is it highly debatable as to whether water vapour acts as a positive or negative feed-back, but what has been observed in laboratories is that CO<sub>2</sub> actually has a logarithmic relationship with temperature. The IPCC literally made its entire conclusion from the results of 6 models.&nbsp; Three of these were extreme scenarios with numbers like a global population of 15 billion by 2100 (almost all demographers expect our population to level at 9 billion), and even the 3 that were &lsquo;moderate&rsquo; were predicting things like the annual rainfall in Ireland should be equivalent to the Sahara&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Today.&nbsp; The unreliable nature of these models probably helps to explain why the IPCC cut almost of all its predictions by a third from 2001 to its most recent report.&nbsp; They also failed to predict the fall in methane levels we've seen since 2002, and their predictions for sea temperatures have been halved due to "incorrectly calibrated instrumentation".&nbsp; As the saying in computer programming goes; "Garbage in, garbage out".</p>
<p>There is an erroneous assumption flying around these days that CO<sub>2</sub> is some how an important forcing factor on the global climate, when every last piece of empirical evidence shows otherwise.&nbsp; Al Gore, and I'm positive he's not the only one, has a graph with 500,000 years of ice core samples showing their chronological temperature and respective CO<sub>2</sub> levels.&nbsp; There is a nice correlation, and the two are definitely linked, but he lies and pretends the relationship is the other way around.&nbsp; In every single time period it is clear that CO<sub>2</sub> levels always trail temperature changes by 500-800 years.&nbsp; Professor Bob Carter of the Marine Geophysical Laboratory at James Cook University, in Australia had the following to say about this; [8] "Al Gore's circumstantial arguments are so weak, that they are pathetic.&nbsp; The man is an embarrassment to US science and its many fine practitioners, a lot of whom know (but feel unable to state publicly) that his propaganda crusade is mostly based on junk science."&nbsp; The historical evidence consistently shows temperature is independent of CO<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp; In fact, 450 million years ago when we were in the depths of the coldest period the Earth has had in half a billion years, CO<sub>2</sub> levels were 10 times above today's!&nbsp; Even using the last century as evidence for a dependent relationship is meaningless.&nbsp; 65% of the warming this century occurred in the first three decades, and then, while CO<sub>2</sub> levels continued to rise, temperatures fell for four decades in a row.</p>
<p>Another misconception that seems to be rife at the moment is that some how CO<sub>2</sub> is a pollutant.&nbsp; I'm sure that you've all learned that this gas is actually fundamental to our existence, but this seems to be as good a time as any to re-cap.&nbsp; Estimates vary, but somewhere around 15% seems to be the common number cited for the increase in global food crop yields due to increased carbon dioxide since 1950. This increase has both helped avoid a Malthusian disaster and preserved or returned enormous tracts of marginal land as wildlife habitat that would otherwise have had to be put under the plow in an attempt to feed the growing global population. Commercial growers deliberately generate CO<sub>2</sub> and increase its levels in agricultural greenhouses to between 700ppmv and 1,000ppmv to increase productivity and improve the water efficiency of food crops far beyond those in the somewhat carbon-starved open atmosphere. CO<sub>2</sub> feeds the forests, grows more usable lumber in timber lots meaning there is less pressure to cut old growth or push into "natural" wildlife habitat, makes plants more water efficient helping to beat back the encroaching deserts in Africa and Asia and generally increases bio-productivity. If it's "pollution," then it's pollution the natural world exploits extremely well and to great profit.&nbsp; What should be obvious is that increases in CO<sub>2</sub> directly increase the vitality of the bio-world.&nbsp; It is no wonder that the Sahara has shrunk 300,000 km^2 in the last couple decades, or that the dinosaurs managed to find the sustenance to survive, despite their size, in an era with 5 times our current CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p>
<p>The last myth I'd like to debunk is the idea that global warming is necessarily a bad thing, regardless of whether we have any significant control over it, or that historically warm periods have been the most prosperous for humans.&nbsp; By far the most hyped consequences are increasing intensities of weather storms, and rising sea levels.&nbsp; Global storm intensities are dominated by the temperature difference between the equator and the poles, and it really is that simple.&nbsp; Even by the IPCC's own admission, in manipulating the area of the poles using the Mercator system to distort the global temperature, the poles must be warming at a rate faster than the equator and this subsequently leads to gentler storms, despite the media explicitly or implicitly making an attempt to blame every last weather anomaly on "climate change".&nbsp; Ah yes, you say, but that would imply that we are in danger of rising sea levels because the warming would melt the ice at the poles.&nbsp; Well, consider this.&nbsp; Since the last ice age 18,000 years ago the global sea level has risen by 130 meters, and is still doing so at a current rate of around 20cm per century, which is dwarfed by local tectonic movements.&nbsp; This will obviously displace people, but it will pale in insignificance when compared to the migrations over the next century caused by other factors such as geographical changes in important resources, fresh water locations, industrialization, etc.&nbsp; Dramatic pictures of breaking seasonal ice is just patent propaganda, the reality is that Antarctica&rsquo;s ice mass has now been growing for the last 30 years against a 6,000 year trend of melting, and it contains over 90% of the world&rsquo;s land ice (sea ice, by Archimedes&rsquo;s principle, does not affect sea levels). Dr. Wibjorn Karlen, emeritus professor, Dept. of Physical Geography and Quaternary Geology, Stockholm University, Sweden, admits, [9] "Some small areas in the Antarctic Peninsula have broken up recently, just like it has done back in time. The temperature in this part of Antarctica has increased recently, probably because of a small change in the position of the low pressure systems."</p>
<p>Our climate is changing, just as it has always done, and always will.&nbsp; In fact, the only constant about our climate is that it changes, which makes you realise the term "climate change" is at best meaningless, and at worst intentionally ambiguous.&nbsp; It feels silly that I need to say this, but clearly it has to be done.&nbsp; The main determinant of our climate is not some gas, which comprises 0.038% of the atmosphere, but the Sun, the planet's orbital eccentricities and axial wobble, cosmic ray flux, and other celestial factors. Greenhouse gases play an important role, but a passive one.&nbsp; It should not come as a surprise that our entire solar system has been warming for the last quarter century, or that the most accurate weather forecasts come from algorithms that concentrate on solar fluctuations and cosmic rays.&nbsp; Cosmic rays are responsible for cloud formations, which are central to the overwhelmingly most important greenhouse gas.&nbsp; Water vapour accounts for 95% of the &lsquo;greenhouse effect&rsquo; and, apart from the elaborate positive feed-back systems in their models that have no actual basis with reality, the global warming alarmists have completely ignored it.&nbsp; This is staggering because H<sub>2</sub>0, by a country mile, in its gas, liquid, and solid form dominates all other terrestrial climate factors.&nbsp; I have included here three graphs to show you how temperature correlates to solar variations, CO<sub>2</sub>, and the global pirate population.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see, meaningless correlations are not difficult to produce.</p>
<p>I hope that by this point you are beginning to understand that there are dozens of simple common sense punches that go straight through the global warming alarmists, and you must now be asking why there is a motive for us being lied to in the first place.&nbsp; The anthropogenic global warming proponents consist of three main groups: politicians, the media, and some scientists.&nbsp; The politicians are easy, as always.&nbsp; As long as they have no personal vested interests that may be damaged by their policies, the global warming hysteria is a windfall for the simple reason that it is a cause that virtually everyone supports and is thus a guaranteed way of being able to raise tax revenue with no political backlashes.&nbsp; The media is similarly obvious.&nbsp; The news sells more papers, magazines, and has more viewers when their audience is scared of some imminent catastrophe that your respective service is reporting on.&nbsp; Problem for them is, we&rsquo;ve been seeing that junk for the last 10 years, so, accordingly, their headlines have had to get more and more shrill to the point of ridiculous.&nbsp; Although, they can't decide whether we're going to burn, starve, freeze, or drown.&nbsp; Perhaps it is indicative that the media has now warned us of impending doom from climate change no less than 4 separate times in the last century.&nbsp; Last, but certainly not least, we come to the scientists themselves.&nbsp; In the late 1980s, the US federal budget for "climate research" was $170 million.&nbsp; Today it is more than $5 billion.&nbsp; There are literally tens of thousands of people who depend on your gullibility, in the US alone.&nbsp; The scientists who produce material to support the anthropogenic global warming theory are rewarded with media attention and political funding.&nbsp; They have abandoned some of the most fundamental principles of science in the pursuit of greed, and I, for one, will certainly not indulge them when the world starts cooling again and they need a job.&nbsp; Of course, there are also plenty of scientists with scientific integrity, but most of them have had their work distorted, misrepresented, suppressed, or passed off as funded by oil companies in the media.&nbsp; These real scientists must find the IPCC&rsquo;s claim that there is a consensus in the scientific community on anthropogenic global warming at the very least a statement of ignorance on the scientific method, and probably downright offensive.&nbsp; More than 4,000 scientists from 106 countries, including 72 Nobel prize winners, signed the <em>Heidelberg Appeal </em>(1992), calling for a rational scientific approach to environmental problems. Many senior scientists have also supported <em>The Statement by Atmospheric Scientists on Greenhouse Warming </em>(1992), <em>The Leipzig Declaration </em>(1997) and finally the <em>Oregon Petition</em> (1998), which received the signatures of over 19,000 scientists [10].&nbsp; Dr. Chris Landsea resigned from the IPCC in his own words, because, [11] "I personally cannot in good faith continue to contribute to a process that I view as both being motivated by pre-conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound."&nbsp; The IPCC&rsquo;s process is highly corrupt.&nbsp; When a report is made, a couple thousand climate scientists each write a small section in their expertise and have no input into any other part of the report.&nbsp; This is the first reason the IPCC produces no scientific consensus.&nbsp; The second reason is that the &lsquo;Summary for Policymakers&rsquo; is written first, by policymakers no less, and then the rest of the report is doctored and manipulated by a handful of "lead authors" to fit the summary&rsquo;s agenda.&nbsp; In fact, some scientists had to threaten legal action before their names were finally removed.&nbsp; But actually all this misses the really big point:&nbsp; Hello?!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the United Nations for crying out loud!!</p>
<p>I think it is important to note that this is a fairly isolated case of how politics can hideously corrupt a respectable scientific field.&nbsp; Humans do affect the planet and scientists play a central role in understanding how.&nbsp; I just hope that in the future good lessons are learned from this on how <strong>not</strong> to have a functional relationship between the scientific community and the public at large, although given humanity&rsquo;s track record I&rsquo;m not holding my breath.</p>
<p>The amount of money being wasted on climate change nonsense is amazing.&nbsp; In fact, in my opinion, the only good thing Bush did with his presidency was refuse the US sign the Kyoto Treaty, which would have had the effect of lowering the Earth&rsquo;s temperature by one tenth of a degree in 50 years time (by the treaty&rsquo;s own estimates) at the price of $400 billion a year.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s $2,700 per American family per year, or 20% of the UK&rsquo;s GDP.&nbsp; At this price the US could provide the entire world with clean drinking water and sanitation, which would prevent 2 million real, not imaginary, deaths (from diseases like infant diarrhea) a year and prevent a half-billion people from becoming seriously ill each year.&nbsp; These initiatives are wasting our money at an enormous opportunity cost.</p>
<p>The point of my article is to show you that the theory of anthropogenic global warming needs to be exposed to criticism to ensure its health.&nbsp; If the theory has merits, then it has to be proved under the rigors of the scientific method, not through political campaigns.&nbsp; It is important for any subject, but especially one on a global scale with so much at stake, to be rationally discussed without the panic, hysteria, and sensationalist rubbish.&nbsp; People who try to suppress this debate are highly irresponsible and their motives should seriously be called into question.&nbsp; A lot of the responsibility for how this is handled rests on you and me.&nbsp; If someone tells you that the world is going to end in 100 years time because of the gases that come out your mouth and backside, you should have the intellectual fortitude to critically question that claim, and not treat like heretics those who do.</p>

Quit arguing and let&#39;s come up with a plan.<br /><br />Our poles are melting, temperature and weather patterns are changing. Those are facts. Whose fault it is, man made or natural is almost irrelevant. The important thing is that we take action to prepare for the unavoidable consequences of climate change NOW.<br /><br />Past climate changes have happened quick, the most recent having taken only about a decade. We have seen weather patterns change over the last few years, lost a bunch of ice, witnessed massive amounts of species going extinct and see a slow-down of the ocean&#39;s conveyor which regulates temperature patterns around the globe. My gut feeling is to say that we are in the midst of climate change. Whether it&#39;s caused by CO2, an active sun or any other cause is not the issue. The issue is... we can&#39;t change, avert or avoid it so we have to figure out how to deal with it and survive it&#39;s effects.<br /><br />The focal point of all the issues surrounding climate change is energy. More specifically, present and future energy. The energy we currently use, which most say changes the climate, and the energy we will need in the future to supply more people and to stave off the effects of a changed climate. We need cleaner fuel now, not only because of pollution or the fact that we are running out, but because we will need much more fuel in the future.<br /><br />The world economy is currently dependant upon CO2 emitting fossil fuels and we won&#39;t just be able to throw a switch to convert to another source so we have to start now. We have to stop spending billions fighting over the remaining oil. No matter who owns it, we will use it up. As demand increases and supply dwindles it will become more expensive and economic factors will dictate that we replace it. If we&#39;re lucky, mankind will be reasonable enough to spend more money finding new energy sources than fighting over obsolete ones. That&#39;s a long shot but there&#39;s always hope.<br /><br />We will need more energy and there is no denying that burning oil and coal pollutes our planet. We have 2 choices if we want to survive as a species.<br /><br />1. Come up with more, preferably cleaner energy.<br /><br />2. Shrink our global population to a size that our current energy supply can sustain.<br /><br />The first is preferable but considering our primitive human nature, the second is more probable. Let&#39;s let common sense overpower human nature and strive towards option 1.<br /><br />Think about it. There are many sources of energy, known and yet to be discovered that we can use. Wind, water, tidal, and solar are clean technologies that we have explored and can improve. We have started tinkering with ways to use the Earth&#39;s magnetic field. There is gravity and countless types of cosmic rays that we haven&#39;t even tried to harness yet. Nuclear has been around for decades and if it doesn&#39;t blow up on you, it is extremely clean.<br /><br />My suggestion, no, my demand is that mankind stop it&#39;s economic and religious squabbling and start taking the action we need for our survival as a species. It will be impossible to get mankind to act as one, but someone has to start. If the US trimmed it&#39;s government and military to a minimum, keeping enough troops and nukes to sustain sovereignty, we could save billions and use it to develop energy sources.<br /><br />That scenario might even be good for the economy. Imagine all of the workers needed to make electric cars or cosmic ray powered toasters. Besides, whoever discovers a technology usually has a lead when it comes to selling it&#39;s usage or the products it spins off.<br /><br />New energy won&#39;t solve global warming but it will help us deal with it better. Right now it&#39;s the only option we have so let&#39;s get on it!<br /><br />Ron<br />http://moreronnie.blogspot.com</p></div></div> </div>

When a man stands up and declares the &quot;scientific debate&quot; over (a definitively impossible state of existence), that man is obviously no rational natural philosopher in any classical Socratic sense, and therefore can not claim to be a &quot;scientist&quot; nor to represent &quot;science.&quot; He is a preacher, and his statements are dogma, not theory.</p></div> </div>

									<div class=small><p>Mr Townes is wrong, and his misjudgement is catastrophic.  It is an elementary physical property of carbon dioxide (and methane) that it behaves as a greenhouse gas.  The Cheney 3C rule states that if the CO2 level in the air is doubled from pre-industrial, the temperature will rise 3C (and Dr James Hansen of NASA adds it will rise another 3C in the long run due to feedbacks).</p><p>To explain the warming now observed, Mr Towne would have to postulate a &quot;factor X,&quot; when instead the current warming can be adequetly explained by the rise in CO2 (and CH4) levels in the air, caused by mankind&#39;s emissions.  That is why the IPCC states with over 90% certainty that warming is occurring, and it is caused by mankind&#39;s emissions.</p><p>I challenge Mr Towne to identify the source of the additional warming in a peer reviewed paper, instead of writing the above psudo-science meant for gullible public consumption.  Remember all the psudo-science casting doubt that smoking tobacco caused cancer?</p><p>The consequence of Mr Townes&#39; misjudgement is that the CO2 (and CH4) level in the air will continue to rise, rapidly changing the mild climate we live in now to the hothouse climate of 55 million years ago when most life died.</p><p>By the way, the last severe global warming episode was ended when ocean life removed the excess CO2 from the air over thousands of years.  In my opinion, it is very unlikely that mankind will cut their emissions so fast and drastically to avoid abrupt climate change or runaway global warming.  I suggest improving nature&#39;s ability by seeding a GMO into the ocean.</p><p>Biosequestration is a low cost, technically feasible, and highly scalable method of removing the excess CO2 from the air.  The CO2 level in the air is the highest it has been for hundreds of thousands of years-what is the harm of using a low cost method to bring it back to the level of the last ten thousand years when the climate has been abnormally mild, and human civilization blossomed?</p><p>Read my blog at <a rel="nofollow" href=http://www.myspace.com/dobermanmacleod>www.myspace.com/dobermanmacleod</a> for more information.

And isn&#39;t it a rather extreme position to believe that the enormous amounts of extra greenhouse gas we are putting into the atmosphere (so far +33% CO2, +100% methane) will be benign? </p><p> If AGW science is correct, life will be very uncomfortable and possibly unsurvivable. </p><p>Polarised political positions (the point of this web site?) mustn&#39;t override objective thinking.

I expect the answer is no, because only a ship of fools would continue to repeat the AGW mantra in the face of the peer-reviewed contrarian science, most of which provides solid irrefutable evidence of the natural state of an ever changing climate - warming on other planets, the fact that anthropogenic CO2 amounts to less than 1/11 of 1% of the greenhouse effect when we include the most prevalent greenhouse gas, aka water vapor, the subsequent fact that anthropogenic CO2 as a &quot;force&quot; factor doesn&#39;t even represent a blip on the Bell Curve when the data are subjected to statistical analysis, the historic record that shows increased CO2 always lagging temperature increases, the growing evidence of variable manipulation (or in some cases outright fraud) on the part of pro-AGW hyperboholics.  Why are you all so willing to sell your souls to this fraud in the face of basic common sense?  Or perhaps this is a case of their politico-religious tenet being exposed, in that the ends (their collective dream of an utopian socialist society) justify the means (proliferation of psuedoscience).</p><p>Whatever the case may be, we are apparently on the precipice of yet another world-wide Nazi movement - in this case it&#39;s the Greens who are donning the brown shirts.

Apparently no one did any real research or they would have discovered that 440 mya the planet plunged into the Andean-Saharan ice age when atmospheric carbon dioxide was over ten times the present level. With a little further real research they would have discovered that, in the current ice age, temperature trends have changed direction at many different temperature levels.

									<div class=small><p>Reading this very long article, and the overabundant comments, I have come to some conclusions.</p><p>Most notably, the author and his fanbase are missing the pertinent point: <strong>DOES ANYBODY GIVE A F*CKING SH!T?</strong> </p><p>Who cares what the climate is doing and whether carbon dioxide causes warming or whether global warming is caused by dark matter, volcanoes, or Al Gore&#39;s farts? Does it really matter what if any correlation results between burning fossil fuels and average global termperature changes?</p><p>I do not know what is the deal with this whole anthropogenic global warming  business. Nor do I care and neither should you! Let us suppose that the chicken little AGW scenario pimped by Mr. Gore is correct. Ok, what then? CO2 increases, the planet heats up a bit, the long term results are more lost polar bears and newsflash, hot, arid shithole desert countries will be somewhat hotter and drier. Tropical lands will be warmer and wetter. That is about it. Does that really affect your lives in anyway? Global warming will turn hot dry deserts into... hot dry deserts! Would anyone really care about the polar bears? Worst case scenario, we can make zoos for them. Which brings up the following joke:</p><p>What&#39;s the difference between capitalists and socialists?</p><p>It is not the case than one or the other does not like animals. Only their approach. The socialist wants to expend resources to save the animal&#39;s  habitats. A capitalist would rather recreate the animal&#39;s environment in a zoo and profit off of visitors. Two different solutions with the same final outcome (the animals get saved), but a different process (one makes money out of the endeavor with no cost to the public beyond personal admission prices, the other spends the public money).</p><p>Also, I have noticed much BS from both sides. For all of the doomsday cries of the global warming alarmists, the behavior of the skeptics no different. &quot;OMG! Global warming, we&#39;re all gonna DIE!1!1!&quot; &quot;Like, OMG, teh AGW people are a cult. They are all religious nutz. LOLz!&quot; Why does anyone care?</p><p>Not to mention, application of the shoot the messenger fallacy. I just find your obsession with AGW people creepy... Let them believe what they want. They may be right, may not, <em>WHO CARES</em>? Why the obsession with something that does not affect the lives of 99.5% of people?</p><p>How about an idea. Why don&#39;t we leave science to scientists and ideology to ideologues? Rather than debating the truth about global warming, why not instead remind everyone of the irrelevancy of the issue? It is a waste of time to argue about the correctness of an irrelevancy. Instead of saying, &quot;Teh AGW is a lie!1!1!&quot; a more effective response would be, &quot;that may be, but it is utterly irrelevant to my life. You are missing the greater point that I don&#39;t give a damn!&quot; </p></div> </div>

									<div class=small><p>Thank you, I see your point now. Still, your counter-argument may be right or wrong.

I think that the most potent weapon in your arsenal is APATHY. If people stopped caring about environmental doomsday scenarios, then there would be less incentives to push &quot;carbon credits&quot; on everyone.</p><p>Bottom line: point out the irrelevancy. By arguing against it, you are at least making appear as if <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> is legitimate. &quot;Anthropogenic global warming&quot; is irrelevant to our lives.

									<div class=small>YES!! very good article indeed - and this last year has been another bad one for the alarmists. Without getting too much into the science, I&#39;ll tell you why this didnt even pass the sniff test. Al gore was the BIGGEST proponent of it - strike one. When it comes to science, the word &quot;consensus&quot; is VERY suspect, and when you hear the two words &quot;overwelming consensus&quot;, get your boots on. When copernicus proposed helio - centric theory, the overwelming consensus was that the Earth was the center of the universe. Similarly, when Galileo observed mountains and craters on the moon, consensus was that the moon was an ether filled glass sphere. When Newton decribed gravity, there was a consensus that Aristotles theory of opposing forces, gravity and levity was correct. And when the Wright bros flew at Kittyhawk, newspapers waited days to report it because &quot;consensus&quot; dictated that it simply WAS NOT POSSIBLE. In the late 1970&#39;s, the &quot;consensus&quot; was that pollution would block the suns rays and - thru global cooling - trigger another ice age. I recently heard this theory once again advanced just the other day. Strike 3 for this &quot;theory&quot; was the Gore comment - &quot;the time for debate is over&quot;. When ya hear this, you KNOW you&#39;re no longer discussing science, but politics. And bad politics at that. I wouldnt wanna have to debate Gores side of the question either. And what happens to those that dare question this junk science? You&#39;re called a &quot;flat earther&quot; and equated with a holocaust denier. RFK jr even suggested that people that refuse to believe this pseudo - scientific &quot;religion&quot; should be tried for &quot;crimes against humanity!&quot; During the Inquisition, the same crime was called heresy. I know my argument contains NO science, wisdom and intuition were enuff for me on this one. But, so as not to be hypocritical, i checked the &quot;science&quot; The truth is the globe hasnt warmed in 10 yrs, its getting colder, and the icecap has grown to the highest levels in 30 yrs.</div> </div>

Why? the 100,000&#39;s of years of climate change that have gone before us should sow us that nothing on earth changes that quickly we have many years to carry out good science to achieve a true understanding of mankind’s impact ( if any) on planet earths temperatures.</p>  <p>Lets please not abandon our approach to good science for the sake of this type of trendy propaganda!

									<div class=small><p>Darryl,</p><p>I&#39;m going to guess the &quot;precautionary principle&quot; refers to reducing CO2 emissions because these people might be right.  I believe that is a simplistic view.  Certainly, there is a chance I&#39;m wrong and they are right, but what&#39;s important is not whether that chance exists but what the probability is and what the cost of preventative measures are.  If you take this simplistic principle and apply it elsewhere, you can see its fallacy.  For example, let me posit that we are under threat of imminent attack from an alien species, and that unless half of all the world&#39;s resources are donated to Edward Townes, we could all die in the invasion.  As you can see, apart from the potential hazard, risk and cost are also both important parameters in determining  whether action should be taken. In my opinion, the risk that they are right about global warming is extremely low, and the cost they propose (in tackling emissions of a gas so entwined in our prosperity) is so high, that it makes the &quot;precaution&quot; intolerable.</p><p> As for the consumption of non-renewable resources, I have two things to say.  First of all, it is a fallacy to assume the resources we have available now are all we will ever have access to.  As we consume more resources and grow in wealth and technology, we are able to access previously unavailable new resources.  It is important that we consume in order to be able to consume from a larger pie.  The other thing I will say, is that I believe in the price mechanism of the free market in determining not just where, but when the right time to consume certain resources is. </p><p>Hope that answers your questions. </p></div> </div>

<p>CO2 in real terms is NOT a pollutant.</p>
<p>CO2 is a requirement in photosynthesis without which all plant life will cease to exist, it follows that without plant life animal life too will cease to exist, including you and me.</p>
<p>By reducing CO2 levels in our atmosphere we would reduce the planet&#39;s food supply. Do we really want that to happen? I don&#39;t think so.</p>
<p>By doubling the nearly trace amount of CO2 in the atmosphere from approx 375 parts per million to 750 ppm, we would bring about a 30 to 40 % increase in the planets vegetation.</p>
<p>Research has proven that increases in CO2 in greenhouses up to 9 % (90,000 ppm) result in substantial increases in plant life. Unfortunately I cannot find a low cost source of CO2 or I would be injecting small amounts of it into my greenhouse. CO2 is plant fertilizer, there is nothing toxic about it.</p>
<p>We are currently in an interglacial period during which time it is normal that glaciers shrink in size. Many glaciers in the northern hemisphere have been receding for over one hundred years, if they had not, we may have a thousand feet or more of ice over our thick sculls.</p>
If the current glacial melt is being caused by man made global warming (AGW), what was the cause of all the previous interglacial periods when there were few if any mankind present to have done so? If you cannot rationally answer this question you cannot intelligently debate the subject of AGW.
<p>Our climate is changing, always has been and always will be. Climate change is NOT a new phenomena.</p>
<p>Any attempt to change the worlds climate, such as seeding the atmospere with products that would reflect the suns rays , could tip us into the start of another ice age.</p>
<p>Much more study needs to be down before we should even dream of artificially afffecting the climate.</p>
<p>Money spent to &#39;reduce our carbon foorprint&#39; is a complete 100 % waste.</p></div></div> </div>

								<div class="small">
									<div class=small><div class=small><p>This article is highly fallacious. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s intentional, since many people falsely think that suspicion of motives can prove a material point. First, the author doesn&#39;t even mention the theoretical basis for CO2 warming the atmosphere, which is absorption of IR by that gas. (&quot;Infrared&quot; doesn&#39;t even appear in the piece.) We have known this since the 19th Century. Even knowledgeable skeptics (like Lubos Motl and Bjørn Lomborg) admit, that CO2 is a warming stimulus the way that vinegar is an acidifier. They just disagree wiith most climate scientists on how much effect it will have.</p>
<p>That leads to the second flaw, the saying that only &quot;some scientists&quot; believe in AGW, and it&#39;s mostly a creation of Al Gore. No, most scientists believe that the CO2 increase will raise the average temperature a few degrees F in the next several decades. The temperature fluctuates like a stock market, but there is currently a long-term upward trend. The temperature can easily go up or down over just one decade. There may be something else making the change, but that wouldn&#39;t disprove the idea of CO2 causing warming. It just means something else is countering the effect.  We can&#39;t assume that counter, if it exists, will last long. We don&#39;t know what it is, and CO2 is better understood. Note that the whole AGW thing is a risk factor, not a certainty. Since when did a risk have to be &quot;certain&quot; to be worth working against?</p>
<p>The CO2 increase often lagging the temperature, is from temperature increasing the release of CO2. Hence it is a positive feedback, and that makes the danger worse.</p>
<p>Also, using the term &quot;pollutant&quot; and arguing against that is a straw man. The danger of CO2 is no more about being toxic than the danger from too much rainfall or wind, but the latter of course can cause harm. And despite some benefit of CO2 on plants, the increase acidifies the ocean and hurts coral.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t attack scientific theories with &quot;common sense&quot; notions and arguments. People try that tactic with relativity theory etc, with pitiful and erroneous results. You need to understand both the basic theory (like IR absorption, etc.) and concepts of statistics. Very few of the scientists in climate research are acting as &quot;politicians.&quot; But many of the skeptics of AGW can&#39;t stand the idea of people making things worse, or fallaciously think that if an idea could be used to justify government control, then it can&#39;t be true. Well, nature and objective reality are what they are, and if you want to object to the nature of the attempted response go ahead.  But political philosophy doesn&#39;t change or disprove natural principles one way or the other.</div> </div>

<p>In Australia our &#39;Climate Change Minister&#39; Penny Wong has released a report she describes as a &#39;sophisticated scientific report&#39;. It purports to prove beyond doubt that climate change will result in a catastrophic rise in sea-levels of 1.1 metres by the year 2100. This will have the result of flooding all low-lying areas around the coast of Australia. We will lose vast tracts of the little livable land we have in this mostly desert country.</p>
<p>Panic everyone!  We have calls for evacuation procedures from low-lying land to be brought in.  Local councils are forbidding development close to the sea.  The hysterical nonsense is increasing in this country not abating.</p>
<p>The problem with the &#39;sophisticated science&#39; in the report referred to by Ms Wong is that even a quick read of the report shows that the &#39;1.1&#39; metre rise in sea-levels&#39; is an unsupported given.  The computer modeller who indulged him/her/them selves took it that there would be a rise at that level. No science to say why that sea-level rise would take place.  The computer model simply tells us what would happen if a 1.1 metre sea-level rise took place.</p>
<p>This is the problem from the alarmists side of things. Totally unsupported nonsense masquerading as science.</p>

But to twist the truth... to out right lie...to scare the populace into compliance with programs and practices detrimental to a society is irresponsible at the very least, if not criminal.</p><p>And if I&#39;m wrong, don&#39;t despair... Even the most prominent of the doomsdayers are only talking about a couple of degrees in average temperatures over the next 100 years. <em>(That&#39;s been exagerated to make people feel like the end of the world as we know it by the next presidential election.)</em></p><p>If this really, really frightens you...   If you are so unsure of how you will cope, I have a plan. Listen closely;</p><p>Adjust your thermostat!</p><p> &#39;Chin up... Keep your electric bill paid up...   You&#39;ll be fine.</p></div></div> </div>

They have no interest in arguing their case (because they have no case to argue), so they are forced to fall back on the Algorean mantra that &quot;the debate is iver&quot; (really? I must have missed it) and &quot;the science is settled&quot;. As the author quite rightly points out, the science is never settled. Even the most well-established scientific theories remain open to question (and occasionally they are disproved).

<p>A good compilaton of factual comment that is worth reading.</p>
<p>For years I have tried to retain a balance in deciding whether anthropogenic warming has any validity or not and I have to say that I can find no published data that shows me conclusively that it is. I have contacted senior politicians and discussed it with dedicated professors but always get the same vague response...........namely that it must be true because &#39;everyone&#39; says it is!</p>
<p>However, when I research the opposing camp, I find a whole different ball game. They do have data and data that I have been able to check in great detail for myself. They have not based their claims on media spectacularism and quick fire money making. Nor is it aimed at controling the population through fear or guilt, or both.</p>
<p>It would seem that the climate may be changing,as it has for all time past, but not due to mankind and there are definitely far greater forces at work that we simply do not yet fully understand.</p>
<p>Alongside that, there are other needs that mankind has to address, such as energy,water and food sustainability which dictate some difficult decision making by governments. It is clear that many politicians see the value of anthropogenic warming as an invaluable whip with which to keep the voters in line.</p>
<p>I personally do not like that and would prefer a shift to truthful disclosure that will enable us to more efficiently and effectively cope with any climate change that is coming our way.</p>
