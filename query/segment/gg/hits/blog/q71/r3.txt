Iceland already enjoys a  high degree of integration with the EU through its membership of the  European Economic Area (EEA) since 1994, as well as the  Schengen area, which allows its citizens to travel and work freely throughout the EU. Through the EEA, Iceland already participates in the  single market and contributes financially towards social and economic cohesion in Europe. A significant proportion of the EU's laws are applied in Iceland today. Iceland also participates, albeit with no voting rights, in a number of  EU agencies and programmes , covering areas including enterprise, environment, education and research. Iceland has been a member of The European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) since 1970 and has a bilateral Free Trade Agreement with the EEC since 1972. Two thirds of Iceland's foreign trade is with EU Member States. Iceland is also a signatory of the  Dublin Regulation  on asylum policy in Europe and was a founding member of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) . The country is an important partner for the EU in the framework of its  Northern Dimension and developing Arctic policy. For a full list of treaties and agreements signed by Iceland and the European Communities, see  here . Hit severely by the 2008 financial crisis and economic downturn, Iceland underwent an economic recession, following the collapse of its banking system and the devaluation of the national currency. Nevertheless, the country's economic base remains strong and the prospect of EU membership is expected to have a stabilising effect on the Icelandic economy. Already, the economy has been gradually making headway out of the crisis, with some encouraging signs of stabilisation and the IMF stabilisation programme on track. The European Commission has amended the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance in order to include Iceland as a beneficiary. The aim of the EU financial assistance to Iceland is to support its efforts towards alignment with the EU  acquis , in order to become fully prepared to take on the obligations of membership of the European Union by the time of accession. Steps towards accession  Iceland submitted its application for EU membership to the Council in July 2009. At the end of July, the Council asked the European Commission to prepare an  opinion on Iceland's application. On the basis of the answers to a  questionnaire completed by the Icelandic authorities and returned to the European Commission in October, the Commission adopted its opinion on Iceland's application for membership on 24 February 2010. The Commission's opinion covers all aspects of the  accession criteria ; political, economic and relating to Iceland's capacity to implement EU law, building on the December 2006 European Council conclusions on a renewed consensus for EU enlargement based on rigorous but fair conditionality and the 'own merits' principle. Based on an assessment of the country's readiness to meet the requirements of EU membership, in its opinion, the Commission recommended opening of accession negotiations with Iceland to the Council of the European Union. On 17 June 2010 a further step in Iceland's bid to join the EU has been taken with the decision by the European Council to  open accession negotiations with the country . On 26 July, the EU Negotiating Framework was adopted; it outlines the principles, substance and procedures guiding the negotiations with Iceland, thus paving the way for the upcoming accession talks between Iceland and the EU. The first intergovernmental conference on the accession of Iceland to the European Union was held in Brussels on 27 July, formally opening accession negotiations with the country. After the formal opening of negotiations with Iceland, technical preparations for the negotiations ('screening') were concluded on 20 June 2011.  The first four chapters of negotiations on Iceland's accession to the EU were opened at an  intergovernmental conference  on 27 June 2011. The chapters in question cover public procurement, information society and media, science and research, as well as education and culture. Simultaneously, negotiations on two chapters – science and research and education and culture – were provisionally closed in view of Iceland's advanced state of preparedness. The status in the accession negotiations is that there are 4 provisionally closed chapters and negotiations have been opened in 6 chapters.
