<p align="center"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="7">Beware of "<i>Christianity 
Today</i>"</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b>By David J. Stewart</b></font></p>
<p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is sad 
and unfortunate that any "Christian" or Christian organization would endorse such 
an evil invention as Harry Potter.&nbsp; The Bible clearly condemns any type of 
involvement with the wicked works of witchcraft.&nbsp; I was saddened to learn from 
one of my faithful web visitors that <i>Christianity Today</i> magazine was 
endorsing Harry Potter.&nbsp; I looked into the matter myself and it was 
confirmed.&nbsp; Below is one such article on their website.&nbsp; If you'll 
simply perform a site search on Christianity Today's website under "Harry Potter," you'll be sickened 
as any God-fearing Christian should be.&nbsp; Harry Potter is evil and we should 
<u>not</u> endorse such wickedness.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS">The partial article below was taken from 
Christianity Today's library at the 
following link:</font></b></p>

      <td width="100%"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial Black" size="5">Why We Like Harry Potter</font><font color="#ffffff" face="Trebuchet MS"><br>
      <b>The series is a 'Book of Virtues' with a preadolescent funny bone.</b></font><p>
      <font color="#ffffff" face="Trebuchet MS">A Christianity Today editorial | It's Christmas 
      present shopping time. Time for your 10-year-old to make his list—and for 
      you to check it twice. But are the Harry Potter books at the top of his 
      list—the first books topping his list for as long as you can 
      remember—naughty or nice? These multimillion-selling stars of bestseller 
      lists cause some anxiety for Christians since the main characters are 
      wizards and witches.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Trebuchet MS">In fact, you may have read newspaper accounts and 
      heard radio reports of how Christians are fighting school boards over 
      having the books in libraries. As a concerned parent, what should you do?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Trebuchet MS">We think you should read the Harry Potter books 
      to your kids.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Trebuchet MS">First, we should all be suspicious of the media's 
      hype of Christian parents objecting to the books. Reporters love the 
      dialectic of first presenting the Christian stick-in-the-mud who objects 
      to or is outraged by something, followed by the "reasonable" person who 
      demonstrates how to be both moral and fun-loving. What remains unreported 
      is that many Christians—such as Charles Colson and Wheaton College 
      literature professor Alan Jacobs—enjoy and defend the Potter series.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Trebuchet MS">Second, Christians should never apologize for 
      rigorously scrutinizing what influences our children. A major scandal of 
      our day is how seldom this happens. Modern witchcraft is indeed an 
      ensnaring, seductive false religion that we must protect our children from 
      (see "The Bewitching Charms of Neopaganism"). But the literary witchcraft 
      of the Harry Potter series has almost no resemblance to the I-am-God mumbo 
      jumbo of ...<br>

<b><font face="Trebuchet MS"><u>First</u>, I would like to say 
that I am proud to be a "stick-in-the-mud" for my Lord and Saviour, Jesus 
Christ.&nbsp; Would to God that more believers were willing to be counted 
amongst the unpopular.&nbsp; The Bible clearly admonishes all believers in 2 
Timothy 3:12...</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#003300" face="Trebuchet MS" size="5">"Yea, 
and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS">It is not very popular nowadays to 
criticize the witchcraft of Harry Potter.&nbsp; Regardless, Harry Potter is 
straight out of hell.&nbsp; Count me in as a "stick-in-the-mud" for God.&nbsp; 
If I'm a stick-in-the-mud for proclaiming that Harry Potter is wicked and of the 
devil, then so be it.&nbsp; Let the truth be known, Harry Potter promotes the 
sin of witchcraft and encourages young people to dabble into such wickedness.
</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS"><u>Second</u>, I'd expect to be 
called a stick in the mud by the heathens, but not from a professed Christian 
organization.&nbsp; I seriously question the validity of any organization's 
so-called "Christianity" who would refer to another separated Christian as a 
"stick-in-the-mud."&nbsp; Did you read what <i>Christianity Today</i> recommends 
in the above article?&nbsp; I quote, "We think you should read the Harry Potter 
books to your kids."&nbsp; That is VERY BAD advice.&nbsp; The issue of Harry 
Potter is an issue of Biblical separation.&nbsp; All Christians are to separate 
from the heathen...</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS">It is wrong for anyone to support 
Harry Potter's witchcraft.&nbsp; Mrs. Rowling's books are introducing children 
to the occult:&nbsp; </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Pagan Federation, which 
represents druids and witches, says it has been "swamped" with calls following 
teenage programs featuring good witches.&nbsp; Speaking to <i>BBC News Online,</i> 
the Pagan Federation's Steve Paine (the high priest of a coven) said the hit US 
drama Buffy and the highly successful Harry Potter books were popular amongst 
practicing witches. "They are taken as fantasy entertainment. But they do 
encourage people to think about different forms of spirituality", he said.&nbsp; 
The Pagan Federation, which deals with about 100 enquiries a month from 
youngsters who want to become witches, does not allow anyone under the age of 18 
to become a member."&nbsp; Most of the enquiries are from 14 to 18 year-olds, 
and are dealt with "reactively" by a specially-appointed youth officer, an Essex 
based schoolteacher." (BBC News Online, <i>Buffy Draws Children to Witchcraft,</i>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS">Third, Mr. Colson and Mr. Jacobs 
are carnal Christians to endorse Harry Potter (if they're Christians at all).&nbsp; 
Any professed "Christian" who endorses Harry Potter needs to learn about the 
holiness of God.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#003300" face="Trebuchet MS" size="5">"Because 
it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy." -1st Peter 1:16</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS">There is NOTHING "holy" about Harry 
Potter.&nbsp; Holiness is "moral perfection."&nbsp; Though we cannot live 
perfect at all times (because we are human beings prone to disobedience and 
anger), we are commanded by God to try to live righteously.&nbsp; It is God's 
Holy Spirit which comes to indwell us at salvation which gives us this desire to 
live for God.&nbsp; I hate everything about Harry Potter, and so does God 
according to the Bible.</font></b></p>

Teenage Witch, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Charmed.&nbsp; It seems we cant get 
enough of all things magical or 'witchy' at the moment. The result of all this 
interest is that Wicca has become the fastest growing religion in the UK. Wicca 
is a nature-based spiritual path that celebrates the feminine, follows the 
changing seasons of the year and is rich with magic and enchantment. But is it 
all spells and hocus pocus?</p>
<p>Kate West's grounded introduction to the Craft separates the Hollywood myth 
from the everyday reality, with all the practical advice you need to follow the 
Wiccan way. There are many coffee-table pretenders around, but Kate West is the 
real thing. Her Witchcraft is about passion, not fashion! She explores the myths 
that surround Witchcraft, its festivals, beliefs, practices and folklore. She 
explains the responsibilities of becoming a Witch and provides plenty of magical 
and herbal spells you can work with - from charms to help you attract your ideal 
partner to healing potions for natural beauty to affirmations that will help you 
find empowerment. Witchcraft can help you to become personally fulfilled as it 
teaches you take control of yourself and your life. Whether you want to join a 
group or a work alone, this is a great guide to Wicca."</p>
