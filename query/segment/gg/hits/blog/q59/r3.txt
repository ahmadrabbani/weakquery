More:  Sasha Cohen  Us Figure Skating  Mirai Nagasu  Rachael Flatt  Speed Skating        Flag  Close      Post a comment            Sasha Cohen made a triumphant return to competitive figure skating and pled her case for a spot on the 2010 US Olympic Figure Skating team this evening at the US National Championships in Spokane with an elegant, polished short program that earned her second place behind 2008 National Champion Mirai Nagasu going into Saturday's long program. Rachael Flatt currently holds third place, rounding out the top three.  Striking in bright red, Sasha Cohen, who had been absent from competition since 2006 and whose form was largely a mystery and very much a recent media curiosity, took to the ice to perform her highly-anticipated short program at about 10 PM Pacific time. She began tenatively, two-footing a landing on her first jump, but gained ground and completed her second and third jumps with precision.  Post-jumps, Cohen put her trademark performance skills on display, showing that her four year absence from competition hasn't taken her out of the running for a spot on the US Olympic Figure Skating team. Her flexibility and grace are still top-notch. She earned 69.63 total points.  During her post-skate interview with Andrea Joyce, Sasha Cohen said "it was wonderful to perform in front of a crowd that was so excited to see me back.... This was a perfect night for me" and said she'd been more "excited" than nervous about the competition.  Sasha Cohen's impressive comeback aside, the night belonged to another skater who staged a comeback of her own.    1  2  3   Next Page    Published by  Sherry Wight - Featured Contributor in Arts & Entertainment  Sherry is a happily married stay-at-home mom to a book-loving second grader, a cancer-fighting superhero preschooler, an energetic three-year old and an early-walking baby boy.
