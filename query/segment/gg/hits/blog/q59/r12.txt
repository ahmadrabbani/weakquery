I'm one of those people that feel like I can feed off the energy and be better. I love to perform. It's when you don't win that you learn things about yourself. Everything I have gone through has made me who I am today. I've stopped trying to be perfect. When I train, I'm not afraid to make a mistake. I train harder and make more mistakes, but I feel more prepared. I'm not holding back and becoming a better athlete. I'd like to cause a little riot in skating. I'm not deeply into Kabbalah, but I appreciate the principles of it, to ward off evil and not think negative thoughts about people.
