Cohen  took a hiatus from figure skating competitions within a year of winning her Olympic medal to pursue a college education, and competed in January for the first time since 2006. Despite high hopes, she  fell short of securing a spot on the U.S. Olympic team. That hasn't stopped Cohen from expressing a lack of confidence in the skaters who outperformed her. "The U.S. girls are young and haven't competed as much internationally, so they're kind of hit or miss," Cohen told  People . "They're good skaters, they're just not at the same level as the international girls." Going into the final night of competition at the 2006 Winter Olympics, Cohen was considered a favorite to win the gold, but she "flubbed her first two jumps," according to  CBS and the AP . "Cohen's history of flopping in the biggest international events bit her again," the article continued. Cohen does, however, believe that an American male will medal in Vancouver. She thinks Evan Lysacek will capture a bronze. Visit  People for  more details . Get HuffPost Sports On  Twitter ,  Facebook , and  Google Buzz !   Know something we don't?
