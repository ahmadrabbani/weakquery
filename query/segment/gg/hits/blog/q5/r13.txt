 The Abramoff scandal isn’t about Bush, you dopes

News outlets have scrambled in the past several days trying to track down photos of indicted superlobbyist  Jack Abramoff with the president . White House spokesman Scott McClellan has been so obtuse about Bush's contacts with Abramoff that journalists are sure there's more to the story. They're eager to catch McClellan in a—well, not a lie, exactly, since he claims the White House just doesn't remember ever meeting Jack Abramoff—let's call it a "calculated vagueness." McClellan is surely hiding something, but whatever meetings Junior had with Jack are moot. No one in their right mind thinks that Abramoff bribed the president of the United States (and they  absolutely did not have sexual relations). First of all, bribery is Congressional territory. Deal-making and campaign-financing are the bread-and-butter of Congress, and nobody has more influence or a greater need for money, certainly not the president. Maybe if Superman was addicted to crack, he'd be more powerful and money-grubbing, but other than that, Congress has a lock.  President Bush is a  fanatical ideolog . He wouldn't change his mind on an issue for love or money. Or  facts , for that matter.    Secondly, President Bush is a fanatical ideolog. He wouldn't change his mind on an issue for love or money. Or facts, for that matter. The man is steadfast in his beliefs, even when the earth rotates out from under him. Finding a connection between him and Abramoff is of no account, then. The superlobbyist probably only wanted to get close to the president to brag about it to his clients, winning him more fat wads of cash with which to persuade members of Congress to vote his clients' way. The scandal remains with  Tom DeLay ,  Bob Ney , and other Republicans who took money from Abramoff and his clients (other, less crooked, members of Abramoff's firm lobbied Democrats and are unlikely to get indicted). The president has plenty of other  problems for us to focus on....   The president has plenty of other problems for us to focus on, like the fact that he lied to American people about trying to avoid war with Iraq and he approved espionage against American citizens—contravening both the Constitution's ban on unreasonable search and seizure  and Congress's special secret FISA court specifically made for  legally contravening the Constitution's ban on unreasonable search and seizures.   f e e d b a c k a b o u t |  r s s |  a d m i n        Running commentaries that you listen to while you watch the movie.  c a t e g o r i e s Business (1)  Culture (9)  Entertainment (109)  Government (3)  Tysto (16)   g e n e r a l About  RSS  Log in     Search for:         Error 404 - Not Found   s i d e b a r Tag cloud commentaries  energy  family  giant.monster  health  history  Indiana.Jones  Internet  James.Bond  merchandise  movie.analysis  movies  Mr.Plinkett  music  photos  politics  Postcards  sight.unseen  Sofa.Dogs  Soulless.Minions  Speakeasy  Star.Trek  Star.Wars  technology  television  The.Asylum  Tysto  White.House Commentaries * Tysto film commentaries   2010: Moby Dick   2012: Ice Age   39 Steps, The   48 Hrs   6th Day, The   Alien   Aliens   Almighty Thor   American President, The   Back to the Future   Blade Runner   Bride of Frankenstein   Cars   Casablanca   Close Encounters   Curse of Frankenstein, The   Day of the Jackal   Diamonds Are Forever   Die Hard   Dinocroc   Dr. No   Dracula   Fifth Element, The   Fistful of Dollars   Fly, The  (1986)    For Your Eyes Only   Foul Play   Frankenstein   From Russia With Love   Galaxy Quest   Ghostbusters   Goldfinger   Goonies, The   Haunting in Salem   Help!
