Maybe this will jog his memory.  shemp 9th January 2007, 03:12 PM  Bush and Abramoff have met. Here is the photo. (http://blog.citizensforethics.org/node/478) In case you think it's a Photoshop job, AP confirms Abramoff/Bush photo (http://blog.citizensforethics.org/node/480) Kim Eisler, Washingtonian magazine writer and a friend of Abramoff's, confirmed the photo's authenticity for The Associated Press. He said he had seen the picture at Abramoff's house.  kalen 9th January 2007, 03:21 PM  Bush looks pretty loaded in that pic. Maybe he really can't recall? What I want to know is if I can have some of whatever Bush was on... he looks so happy.  Spindrift 9th January 2007, 03:29 PM  I don't particularly believe Bush, but that picture doesn't prove that he should remember meeting Abramoff. The president, any president, probably has thousands of pictures taken every year with people he won't remember.  Darth Rotor 9th January 2007, 03:57 PM  Bush looks pretty loaded in that pic. What I want to know is if I can have some of whatever Bush was on... he looks so happy. Story is: GWB quit drinking, you can thank Laura. That may also be a piece of image crafting.  Maybe he really can't recall? Perhaps that's his way of being Reaganesque. :)  DR  marksman 9th January 2007, 04:13 PM  What I want to know is if I can have some of whatever Bush was on... he looks so happy. In December 2003? He was high on power. I wouldn't mind a shot of that! You don't see that smile too often today.

Bush not remebering everyone he meets or takes a picture with is a reasonable notion to believe. Could he be lying? sure. Could he be telling the truth? sure.  kalen 9th January 2007, 04:44 PM  Story is: GWB quit drinking, you can thank Laura. That may also be a piece of image crafting.  Perhaps that's his way of being Reaganesque. :)  DR I wasn't thinking about booze. His expression suggests a combination of magic mushrooms and percodan.  � 2001-2009, James Randi Educational Foundation.
