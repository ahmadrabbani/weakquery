 Abramoff Was on Idiot Son's Transition Team in 2000 - Progressive Minds

 Progressive Minds  Blogging live, from somewhere in the reality-based community. Speaking truth to power. You've entered the real "no spin zone." Republicans beware! 2006/1/11 Abramoff Was on Idiot Son's Transition Team in 2000  @ 07:25 PM (71 months, 5 days ago)   So the next time you see Idiot Son and his apologists try to disassociate Idiot Son from Jack Abramoff, just remember that Abramoff was on the Bush/Cheney Transition Team in 2000. Abramoff was named to the Bush Transition Team for the Department of Interior, which, what a coincidence, happens to regulate those infamous Indian casinos that helped inflate Abramoff's pockets. Yet, the WH is trying to say that Idiot Son didn't have a relationship with Abramoff. From the   WaPo  :  By E. J. Dionne Jr. Friday, January 6, 2006; A19      It almost makes you feel sorry for Jack Abramoff.  Republicans once fell all over themselves to get his "moolah," the term used famously by the disgraced superlobbyist, and to get his advice on dealing with that warm and cuddly entity known as "the lobbying community."  Suddenly, Abramoff enters two plea bargains, and these former friends ask, in puzzled tones, "Jack  Who ?"  -snip-  Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, insisted on Wednesday that Bush does not know Abramoff personally. But the record makes clear that Abramoff was a loyal and serious player in Bush's circles.  According to an Oct. 15, 2003, story in Roll Call, Abramoff was one of a half-dozen lobbyists who raised $100,000 for Bush's 2000 campaign. When Bush was battling Al Gore's efforts to recount Florida's votes, Abramoff was there with the maximum $5,000 contribution Bush was taking for the effort. A September 2003 National Journal story noted that Abramoff was so confident he would meet his fundraising goals for the president's 2004 campaign that he was planning, as the lobbyist generously put it, "to try to help some other lobbyists meet their goals."  -snip-  This careful judge of what it means to be an "honorable public servant" had reason to prefer the Bush administration's taste in appointees. After the 2000 election, Abramoff was named to the Bush transition team for the Interior Department, which regulates the Indian casinos that paid Abramoff his inflated fees.    Abramoff and His Vanishing Friends     The way BushCo. is running away from Abramoff, is very reminiscent of the way they ran away from Enron crook Ken Lay. The White House wanted the American public to believe that Bush did not know Ken Lay, and we subsequently learned that they knew each other so well that Bush gave him a special nickname: "Kenny Boy."         » Leave a comment Name  E-mail  URL  Notify me on new comments.
