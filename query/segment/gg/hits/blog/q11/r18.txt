Unfortunately, New Orleans is down to one working adult hospital. That is a recipe for disaster. The city needs this celebration both emotionally and financially, but its stricken hospital system requires help to ensure that it is a safe one. Doctors say the biggest problem is facilities, specifically hospital beds. There are no psychiatric beds available for mentally ill patients. And the lack of primary care means emergency rooms are swamped with people suffering from less pressing ailments. Emergency patients in Orleans and other parishes nearby are currently stuck on ambulance stretchers for a minimum of 45 minutes and up to six hours while waiting for treatment, according to city statistics.  And that's right now. During Mardi Gras, 911 calls usually triple. It is frightening to think what could happen without additional resources. In emergency medicine, delays can lead to fatalities. The last thing New Orleans needs is more preventable deaths. The city's convention center announced that it would allow the temporary clinic there to operate through Fat Tuesday, the final day of celebration before the beginning of Lent. As of right now, officials say they expect Tulane University Hospital and Clinic to partly reopen in time for the carnival celebration. If the university and its partner, the hospital company HCA, can get the doors open by then it would be a major step toward averting disaster.  It's not enough. So far, the city has been unable to scrape together even small additions to prepare for Mardi Gras. Officials have asked for tents to expand the convention-center clinic and a mobile medical unit with 60 more beds for patients. But that is where the bureaucratic morass begins. City requests must be sent through the State of Louisiana, which forwards them to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for consideration. FEMA is still considering the request for the mobile unit, even as the clock is ticking down. Let's see. Impending problem, clear needs and no one taking responsibility. Sound familiar?  This is unacceptable. These reasonable requests must be met, even if Congress has to take special action to ensure that it happens. The sad fact is that New Orleans has all but dropped off the map of national priorities. Listening to President Bush's State of the Union address, one would be hard pressed to guess that one of America's greatest cities and the region around it had been laid to waste only five months earlier. This catastrophe barely merited a mention until the end of an otherwise lengthy speech.  Mardi Gras throws the health crisis into sharper relief, but it extends beyond the party season. The return of residents, which has accelerated with the reopening of some schools and universities, has meant more people needing emergency services. State officials should re-evaluate whether parts of the old Charity Hospital can be reopened at least temporarily, as the mayor has requested.  It will take years to get the health care system back to what it was, but there are only days until the festival begins on Feb. 18. New Orleans needs a triumphant Mardi Gras, not a dangerous one.
