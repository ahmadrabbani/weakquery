Since he goes to Whole Foods with his mother at least three times a week, sometimes more, this was about as exciting to him as a field trip to the bathroom. But they've been talking about nutrition in class lately, I guess, and there's a Whole Foods within walking distance of the Catholic church that's Elijah's school's temporary home, so to the grocery store they went.  Regina and I needed to rack up some volunteer hours, so we agreed to chaperone.    When teacher asked, today, how many kids had been to Whole Foods before, 16 of the 19 present raised their hands.  "I went there this morning before school," said one girl, "so my mommy could get coffee." This wasn't exactly a new nutritional frontier for the kids. Our very nice tour guide tried to explain the company's mission, about how their trucks aren't allowed to drive more than seven hours to deliver food, about how Whole Foods only uses hormone-free beef and sustainably-farmed fish, but the kids were too busy swarming me for the bag of baby carrots I'd been given to hand out to pay any attention. Later, they grew even more insistent about getting strawberries, and organic cheese puffs and Whole Foods-brand Oreo-style cookies, like zombies trying to get into the house in  Dawn Of The Dead .  At one point, the guide turned to Elijah and said, "Elijah, do you what animal beef comes from?" Elijah shrugged his shoulders.  "Oh, come on, Elijah!" Regina said, and I said more or less the same thing. We knew he knew the answer. But he either froze in the clutch or really didn't give a crap. I knew this because I asked him the question again later, and he got it right.  We spent the last 15 minutes of the field trip trying to keep the kids in line while we waited for bathroom tokens. That was a lot of fun, and very educational for everyone. As we walked home, my assigned group of three--"The Purple Potatoes"--discussed the glories of the morning.  "So what did we learn today about Whole Foods?" I asked.  "Organic," said a girl.  "What does that mean?" I asked.  "Vitamins," said Elijah.  "OK," I said. "It's got vitamins. But it's also free of pest....pest....pest what?" "Pestilence!" said Elijah.  Where had he learned  that  word? "Yes, it is free of pestilence," I said. "But it's also free of pesticides."  "It's free of Justin Timberlake," said a boy, who was picking his nose as invoked that sexy name.  "Yes it is," I said, "though it's possible we could see him shopping at one in the Valley."  "Webkinz," said the boy. His mind had obviously moved onto matters non-food-related. It hardly mattered, though. Most of these kids would be in a Whole Foods again soon. Some of them would probably be there after school. Regardless, they would almost certainly leave the store without having contracted pestilence.  With that, my friends, I'm being "rotated out" of the Epicurious group blog. Thanks to the editors for letting me play through all these months. I've always wanted to do food writing. This has been the fulfillment of a mini-dream for me, and I appreciate all of you who've shared your comments and enthusiasm.  Come visit  Offsprung , particularly if you have kids.  Pick up a copy of my book , if you're feeling generous. And please enjoy your next meal, and all your meals thereafter.  Cheers, NP        Tagged with:  Kids ,  Neal Pollack       Comments (19)       mbigner  10:12:10 AM on  04/02/08  waaaahhhh! i followed you to this site and now shop only with its advertisers, make only recipes it mentions, read only magazines it's affiliated with and whatever will i do now? i suppose i'll pack up and follow you to the next place you blog. but i'll miss the foodie talk. rats. i hope you'll "circulate" back into "rotation" again here. till then, bye epilogs.        hai_fame  02:42:47 PM on  03/14/08  Your blog will definitely be missed. Your food adventures with Elijah are/were refreshing and I think that if you decided to continue blogging about it on your own, you would develop quite the following. Best of luck in the future.      lvfrdr  12:25:03 AM on  03/12/08  No, it can't be true! Yours is the only blog I read consistently. Yes, I'll glance at the others, but only because I came here to read yours. You provide a good dose of humor and joy to an otherwise fairly dry subject. I don't even have children, but I LOVE your Elijah stories. Who do I have to beg to keep you writing for us?? Lisa in PA      galaxiepi  12:48:11 PM on  03/10/08  Oh come on now, really??? Yours was the only epicurious blog I looked forward to every day! One can only read articles about obscure cheeses and new hydroponic, organic, rare gourmet truffles of the Appalachians so many times. You contributed a little bit of entertaining, relatable, everyday commentary in a world of foodies that was highly refreshing. So, so sad.      nealpollack  07:18:21 PM on  03/09/08  Thanks for your kind words and support, everyone! Maybe I'll be back?       janekathryn  09:35:51 PM on  03/08/08  Don't go!!!      stjamesb  07:20:42 PM on  03/08/08  no way, you can't be rotated out ! I protested !! Your blog is the only one that I read regularly. C'm on, where do I find hilarious stories about kids and food? The stories speak to me because I have a 4yr old. Which power-to-be should I write to let him/her know that I like to read your posts and would like to have them continue?      meowsies  03:51:12 PM on  03/08/08  I'm really upset that you're leaving! Elijah stories made me so happy - you became a part of my day & when you didn't have a post I would be disappointed. I have to admit from time to time I will wonder about Elijah and his food escapades. I wish you all of the best and hope that you come back for a visit from time to time.       mikemill  01:56:42 AM on  03/08/08  And immediately, the Epicurious blog comes off my Rss reader... Neal was the only one worth reading...      groodie  09:44:56 PM on  03/07/08  You were by far my favorite epicurious.com blogger! My nephew and Elijah should hang out- for his birthday he insisted on sushi, and by sushi he meant sashimi. He ate a whole boat (literally) of the stuff. Offsprung.com is great, but where will we find more stories of Elijah and your seaweed-smoothie-taco-whipped cream with sprinkles adventures?       jeremypb  05:07:20 PM on  03/07/08  I actually know someone that works at a whole foods in LA and saw Justin Timberlake in there. How funny is that?      sk2915  03:13:17 PM on  03/07/08  I really enjoyed your blog, thanks for sharing your family with us. Did you know that Pestilence was a DC Comics Villian?       sk2915  03:13:12 PM on  03/07/08  I really enjoyed your blog, thanks for sharing your family with us.

Did you know that Pestilence was a DC Comics Villian?       janetmow  01:23:41 PM on  03/07/08  Yes, too bad. I'll miss your blog, which sometimes makes me chuckly out loud. And I've forwarded several of your columns on to friends. Was curious during the writers' strike what your affiliation with screenwriters is/was. Will you be doing more showbizzy stuff?       Korenmanning  01:18:00 PM on  03/07/08  So sad you're being "rotated" out! I adore your posts!      shalv  01:14:33 PM on  03/07/08  Damn. We'll miss you.      kevinkos81  01:12:04 PM on  03/07/08  I've never been so sad ... sad ... saddened!      maquillage  12:10:03 PM on  03/07/08  Glad to have "met" you and your family. I don't have kids but will check you out at Offsprung. I have to say I will miss your refreshing and humorous take on life. Hope you get to visit every now and then.
