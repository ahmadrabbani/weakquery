And the seven Colorado ranchers will be able to see their beef in local stores, rather than have it shipped to faraway markets. “These are local multi-generational family ranchers who raise 100 percent grass-fed cattle and who are good stewards of Colorado’s delicate rangelands. Their cattle are raised strictly on pasture and never confined to feedlots,” said Mack Graves, CEO of Panorama Meats. Panorama Meats, based in Vina, Calif., is the nation’s largest producer of organic, 100 percent grass-fed and grass-finished beef. Panorama began supplying Colorado-raised and processed Panorama Organic Grass-Fed Beef last year to Whole Foods Market’s Pearl Street store in Boulder. Its beef is now the exclusive organic grass-fed beef sold at Whole Foods Market stores in Boulder, Superior, Highlands Ranch, South Glenn and Fort Collins. Panorama’s Colorado ranchers include KW Farms in Alamosa, Kiowa Valley Organics in Roggen, Maytag Mountain Ranch in Cotopaxi, Mountain Island Ranch/Bieser Creek in Glade Park, Blue Range Ranch/San Juan Ranch in Saguache and Salazar Ranch in Manassa. Panorama cattle are raised entirely on pastures of natural grasses, legumes and range forage. Cattle are never implanted with hormones, fed animal by-products or treated with antibiotics.  All animals are raised in compliance with the Born and Raised in the USA® verification program. Panorama's ranchers treat their animals humanely in low-stress environments and employ pasture-rotation and land-management practices that promote animal health and protect delicate rangeland ecosystems.  More information about Panorama is available at  www.panoramameats.com .
