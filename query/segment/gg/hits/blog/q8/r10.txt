Adweek's list of the Top 5 Super Bowl ads of 2011 is out and two of Portland-based Wieden+Kennedy's commercials rated.  "Born of Fire," Wieden + Kennedy's 160-second spot for Chrysler, finished in second place. "Siege," the animated spot W+K produced for Coca-Cola, has the fifth spot. Any other year where a kid dressed as Darth Vader starts a VW with the force and, who knows, "Born of Fire" is a sure number one.  Adweek says this about "Born of Fire," whose tagline "Imported from Detroit" must be, for Michigan natives, one of the most recurring Facebook status updates today:  2) Chrysler, "Born of Fire" Wieden + Kennedy, Portland, Ore. The "Born of Fire" title perfectly sets up Chrysler's 120-second gritty love letter to Detroit. The two-minute driving tour of the city, directed by Sam Bayer, establishes the premise with the taunting challenge: "I got a question for you. What does this city know about luxury?" The copy, credited to the Wieden team of Joe Staples, Mark Fitzloff, Kevin Jones, Greg Rutter and Dan Kroeger, with art direction by Jim Lasser, powerfully pushes the spot forward, timed to the beats of "Lose Yourself," as the viewer catches glimpses of Eminem driving the Chrysler 300. "What does a town that's been to hell and back know about the finer things in life? More than most. . . . It's the hottest fires that make the hardest steel." The Detroit pride swells along with the music as Eminem finally drives up to a theater where a chorus is singing his song. He turns to the camera with defiant finality, "This is the Motor City and this is what we do." The ad is nicely capped off with the "Imported from Detroit" tagline.     Of "Siege," Adweek says:    5) Coca-Cola, "Siege" Wieden + Kennedy, Portland, Ore. While I liked the warm and fuzzy sentiment expressed by two opposing guards connecting over a Coke in "Border Patrol," I prefer the more plausible "Open Happiness" moment in the animated fantasy spot when a bottle of Coke thwarts the attack of a fire-breathing dragon in the 60-second "Siege." A Trojan horse trick sends a giant ice dragon to confront the attacker. It melts, revealing the Coca-Cola inside, and peace and fireworks ensue. Nexus produced the spot with directors FX and Mat. Framestore provided CGI and animation.     Oh, and of course there's a Five Worst list and, of course,  Groupon's hideously unfunny commercial  made the list.  -- Allan Brettman        Related topics:  adweek ,  chrysler ,  coca-cola ,  groupon ,  wieden+kennedy         Sponsored Links                  Share this story                Print  Email  Story tools              More stories in Playbooks and Profits    Previous story Adweek: Wieden+Kennedy co-founder Dan Wieden exploring succession plans   Next story Extra Innings Vancouver provides indoor training facility for area baseball and softball players              Copyright 2011 OregonLive.com.
