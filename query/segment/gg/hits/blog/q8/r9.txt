And many that  missed the mark . There were also a few that did not make the cut, which you can check out here.  First (and unsurprisingly on the list) is adult dating site Ashley Madison, which is a dating site for married people. The commercial has everything -- a scantily-clad woman, backseat sex, lesbian insinuations, a beaver and encouragement to "have an affair." We cannot imagine how this didn't make the Super Bowl broadcast.  The ETrade baby outtakes are actually pretty funny, we're surprised it didn't air. We might have to take advantage of the Baby Mail site, since our dad finds those commercials funnier than anything in the world and he would probably laugh his butt off to get an email from the ETrade baby.  The final banned ad is in reference to the potential NFL lockout of 2011, which you can read about in  more detail here . Again -- not surprised that didn't make it to air.

Thanks. Alex2 | February 7, 2011 10:19 AM   I wanted to see the banned Super Bowl ads but when I clicked on a video, I get a notice saying that unless I am living in the States, I can't view them. I am in Canada and I didn't realize that Canadaians were not permitted to view American commercials. Too funny! I guess they are REALLY banned. But I would like to know why we can't see them. Frank | February 7, 2011 2:33 PM   True, the Ashley ad is pretty tasteless, but the animal is definately not a beaver. Haven't you ever been to a zoo or watched a nature program? The animal is a nutria. sue | February 7, 2011 5:57 PM   Not a nutria, not a beaver. It's a capybara; however, I don't claim to understand the randomness of putting the world's largest rodent it this commercial... HairyLime | February 7, 2011 8:30 PM   i consider the NFLPA commercial ironic  jay | February 7, 2011 10:00 PM   The E-trade video is not an actual ad - looks like a spoof on the baby concept. They did it last year too.  Sidney | February 7, 2011 10:16 PM    Post a comment        Name:  Email Address:  (optional, will not be published)   URL:  (optional)   Remember personal info?
