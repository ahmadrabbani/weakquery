There are so many things wrong with this, it's not possible to go in to all of the ramifications in a post intended to be a simple quote. However, in a post titled “Dopiest Constitutional Amendment of All Time?”, former Reagan advisor, Bruce Bartlett, summarizes it nicely: In short, this is quite possibly the stupidest constitutional amendment I think I have ever seen. It looks like it was drafted by a couple of interns on the back of a napkin. Every senator cosponsoring this POS should be ashamed of themselves.  For more on what this would mean, be sure to read  Bartlett’s full post .
