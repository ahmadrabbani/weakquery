 even yet another blag: A conservative for higher taxes: Bruce Bartlett's The New American Economy

      skip to main  |  skip to sidebar  even yet another blag   because the unexamined life is not worth living         Thursday, October 22   A conservative for higher taxes: Bruce Bartlett's  The New American Economy    As part of guest blogging at  Library Grape , I received a review copy of economic historian Bruce Bartlett's new book,   The New American Economy  , which I've finished reading. The book is well-researched and clearly written; I recommend it to any lay person interested in the history of modern American macroeconomics (1929-present). I may post a longer review once I've had more time to digest it, but in the mean time here's a diavlog between Bartlett and David Frum, two conservatives who are refreshing in their honesty.   posted   5:51 PM             Labels:  conservatives ,  economics        0 comments:     Post a Comment                   Newer Post    Older Post   Home   Subscribe to:  Post Comments (Atom)    Blog Archive  ►     2011  (1)  ►     February  (1) Quote of the day        ►     2010  (454)  ►     December  (1) Moved to Library Grape      ►     November  (42) Consequences of having evolved  The limits of the Wyden-Brown approach to state in...
