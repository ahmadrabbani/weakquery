Co-organizers  David Berlind and Doug Gold are nailing down the location, but signups for a maximum of 250 developers and observers are open. Using my supreme design skills, I whipped up a logo:   Which sucked, so Pete Kaminski made one:  Which is a trip.  And Chris Radcliffe made one too:  Now the logos are in rotation on the wiki.  You too can contribute one (expect modest fame, possibly T-shirts, no fortune), and people are  voting on this wiki page .   Oh, and huge hat tips to  FooCamp ,  BarCamp ,  Ward Cunningham ,  Kwiki and the  Open Space Method .
