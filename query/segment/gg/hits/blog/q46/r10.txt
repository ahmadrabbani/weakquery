See the  bottom of this post from David Berlind . Hopefully David will put up a full post in a conference roundup.    This is (literally) a big vote of confidence by the developer community in Silicon Valley. The way the conference works is that there  bout 30 websites that demo to the 400 attendees at the conference and each attendee is allowed to vote for one and only one site that they think is the best.        I know that Dave Schorr has put a ton of time and effort into Weather Bonk and it’s great to see him be recognized.
