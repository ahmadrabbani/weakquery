 Ted Shelton     « Death of Media? |  Main |  Mashup the Mashup »  Mashup Camp I am spending today and tomorrow at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, attending  Mashup Camp , a gathering of 300 people all interested in how the next wave of the web is going to be one in which we mix things together... I created a Bee of blog posts and articles coming out of the conference, initialy for myself -- but then realized that others might be interested to see it, so here it is: Mashup Camp Bee  If you use it and have comments on the Bee, I'd love to hear them!  Email me at: tshelton (a) personalbee.com    February 20, 2006   |  Permalink       Comments    Verify your Comment Previewing your Comment  Posted by:    |       This is only a preview.
