Cannot be viewed in Canada :(.    Thu Aug 26, 06:07:00 AM 2010                Chiara said...  In Canada you have to view the The Daily Show from the CTV site: http://watch.ctv.ca/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart/ Susie, please give the date and clip number of the show, and maybe the topic, since it is unclear which one you want us to see. If the Daily Show airs in the UK look at the local channel it airs on to find the episode. Ditto other countries.    Thu Aug 26, 08:03:00 AM 2010                Susie of Arabia said...  Sorry you're all having trouble viewing the video outside the US. I posted the information now so hopefully you can locate it.    Thu Aug 26, 08:16:00 AM 2010                Chiara said...  Thanks Susie. Here is the  URL for the relevent clip to be viewed from Canada. Any send up of FAUX news is good by my estimation. This is a fun one! Thanks again! :)    Thu Aug 26, 09:33:00 AM 2010             Anonymous said...  Its sad that the saudi prince and his kingdom is the largest financer of terror around the world.

It seems like a lose lose situation when it comes to fox news, They tend to just say stuff to fit there overall agenda. then the next week flip it. :S    Thu Aug 26, 02:45:00 PM 2010             Anonymous said...  Sweet web site, I hadn't noticed susiesbigadventure.blogspot.com previously during my searches! Keep up the great work!    Thu Aug 26, 02:47:00 PM 2010                Angelle said...  So ridiculous that this is called the "terror mosque." The congregation will build a mosque on their correctly-zoned, privately-owned land, as is their unalienable right in the USA. We can't let the agenda of a few short-sighted people override our obligation as US citizens to honor everyone's right to freedom of religion.

As for terrorism funding, I doubt it since the media in America always try to show muslims in a bad way. While ago I watched a documentary about fox news and it was shocking the amount of lies they were speeding around their media.    Thu Aug 26, 06:10:00 PM 2010                Chiara said...  Majed-you are most welcome. It was a pleasure! :)    Fri Aug 27, 04:56:00 AM 2010               CoffeeJitters (Judy Haley) said...  Interesting how here in the states we get better quality news from the Comedy channel than from Fox News    Fri Aug 27, 06:19:00 AM 2010                LivingCuriosity said...  For those outside the US and CA, try this link and see if it works: http://www.in.com/videos/watchvideo-the-daily-show-the-parent-company-trap-9379707.html    Fri Aug 27, 09:29:00 PM 2010                Mr. Nighttime said...  Angelle - It's not a question of religious freedom or of constitutional rights. The NYC Council already decided that they have the right to build it, and Mayor Bloomberg was behind it. It's a question of sensitivity, with the location being so close to the World Trade Center. This is the heart of the dispute.  The right to do something is not necessarily the right thing to do.    Fri Aug 27, 10:24:00 PM 2010             Anonymous said...  So....Comedy Central is more accurate than Fox News? When that happens, people need to look into what they're being fed by the media.    Sat Aug 28, 03:01:00 AM 2010               Jay said...  Mr. Nighttime, you have to ask yourself WHY this is such a sensitive issue.  Why would building a community center even BE a problem? Because of the way a lot of the media demonizes Islam. It's the thing that no one wants in their neighborhood now, because of what they've been hearing. How many Americans have heard of Islam from a Muslim or someone who knows what they're talking about, and how many have just turned on the TV for the past ten years and have just seen "ISLAM = TERRORISM." You cannot hold entire religion responsible for the actions of 19 people.    Sat Aug 28, 03:05:00 AM 2010               Jay said...  Susie, I forgot to ask, may I please link this post on my blog?    Sat Aug 28, 03:24:00 AM 2010                Susie of Arabia said...  To Jay - Of course!    Sat Aug 28, 03:25:00 AM 2010               Jay said...  Thank you Susie! It's just a fledgling blog, but this was too funny to pass up.  Thanks again.    Sat Aug 28, 03:46:00 AM 2010                Mr. Nighttime said...  "Mr. Nighttime, you have to ask yourself WHY this is such a sensitive issue. Why would building a community center even BE a problem?" The answer to that is actually quite simple: WTC is still a raw nerve to many New Yorkers. Yes, Islam (along with many other religions, quite frankly)can and is misunderstood. It is also misinterpreted by many of those who practice it, just as Christianity is, or Judaism, or Hinduism, etc. Interpretation of any religion or belief is an incredibly subjective thing. Orthodox Jews spend literally years on interpretation of Halacha (Jewish Law) via the Talmud, and still there are always disagreements.  As for the media, that is a very broad statement. Much depends on which segment of the media you are referring to. The Conservative end, (Fox News, et. al.) will demonize all Islam for the most part, while more liberal media outlets are accused of being too soft on Islam. Remember the old press adage, "If it bleeds, it leads?" This falls under that domain.  Yes, you cannot hold an entire religion responsible for the actions of one sect. Sadly though, it is precisely the violent actions of one sect that get the most play, and tend to leave the deepest impressions on people's minds. I still ask the question: "What are moderate Muslims doing to dispel this image, and more importantly, what are they and their governments doing to control and suppress those elements that would cause harm and hijack Islam for their own purposes?" Let's be honest here. The Saudi government is not exactly known for expressing a "moderate" view of Islam with Wahabbism at its core.    Sat Aug 28, 05:14:00 PM 2010             James said...  Keith Olbermann hardly hits a home run. He strikes out, because he is at once ignorant and twisting the truth, just as the right-wingers are. The caution of Martin Niemöller is not applicable. There is no denial of worship to Muslims in the U. S. nor is there a denial of their democratic rights. There are many counter demonstrations for the mosque. The claim is that the mosque/community center will be “Open to all New Yorkers.” Therefore, a few questions are in order: • Will women be permitted in the same place as men in the prayer space or will they have to go to the back of the bus or perhaps be behind a screen or even the basement?  • Will Muslim women be permitted to lead prayer?  • Will non Muslim women be permitted in the space without having to don a scarf?  • Will the swimming pool be gender segregated?  • Will Jews and gays be welcome in all facilities including the prayer spaces?  • What will be taught about Jews, animists, polytheists, gays and atheists?  • What about apostasy, what will be taught about that?  Will imam Rauf the “gentle Sufi” renounce Hamas as a terrorist organization? Will he take back these statements?: “throughout my discussions with contemporary Muslim theologians that an Islamic state can be established in more then just in a single form or mold. It can be established through a kingdom or a democracy. The important issue is to establish the general fundamentals of Shariah that are required to govern. It is known that there are sets of standards that are accepted by [Muslim] scholars to organize the relationships between government and the governed.” When questioned on this, that “the current governments are unjust and do not follow Islamic laws” Abdul Rauf commented “new laws were permitted after the death of Muhammad, so long of course that these laws do not contradict the Quran or the Deeds of Muhammad…so they create institutions that assure no conflicts with Shariah.”  ============ "I wouldn't say that the United States deserved what happened," Rauf elaborated,  "but United States policies were an accessory to the crime that happened." Rauf further stated that  “because we [Americans] have been accessory to a lot of innocent lives dying in the world,”  it could be said that  “[i]n fact, in the most direct sense, Osama bin Laden is made in the USA.” To date, no “Islamophobics” have blown up any Islamic site. There has been little backlash against Muslims in the west since 9/11. In fact, westerners have gone out of their way to protect the democratic human rights of Muslims. Compare that to the daily terror carnage worldwide without so much as a peep out of most Muslims objecting to the bloodshed.    Mon Aug 30, 03:38:00 AM 2010             Phoenicia said...  There is no anti Muslim hysteria in the U. S. There is merely objection to the building of a mosque in the designated place. They are welcome to build anywhere else. No one is denying their right to worship.  FBI data: Hate crimes against Muslims rare Numbers have declined over recent years, but above pre-Sept. 11 level http://www.sacbee.com/2010/08/27/2989095/fbi-data-hate-crimes-against-muslims.html#storylink=scinlineshareb "Arab-American hate crimes down since 9/11" The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said it received an average of 120 to 130 reports of ethnically motivated attacks or threats each year between 2003 and 2007, a sharp decrease from the 700 violent incidents it documented in the weeks following the 2001 attacks. http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081204/ts_nm/us_crime_usa_arab/print;_ylt=AuaC4HfZQWg7RhWglA3oOe9g.3QA "Hyping Hate Crime Vs. Muslims INVESTOR'S BUSINESS DAILY  Discrimination: New FBI data on hate crimes reveal Muslim groups are crying wolf about exploding anti-Muslim abuses. They're actually shrinking, belying claims of mass Islamophobia. Not only are anti-Islamic hate crimes way down, but they're a fraction of overall religious hate crimes. The  overwhelming majority of such crimes target Jews, something CAIR and other Muslim groups don't seem all that concerned about. http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx?id=281576932449479 ============== Perhaps Mr. Olbermann should go to Cordoba and see in person the Mezquita, built on a Christian church, to which Muslims continue to come and demand to pray en masse. The Spanish government refuses such requests because, within the center of the mosque is a cathedral.  No one is stopping Muslims from worshiping. There is a Muslim prayer “Masjid Manhatten” in the area and has been there since 1970. However, a 13 story building is a bit different because people see it as Muslims gloating. A majority of Americans and a majority of New Yorkers are against this mosque/community center being built. Odd that in a democracy the will of the people is discounted.  No one will stop the building of the mosque, unless it is for non payment of taxes, since it has come out that the developers owe almost $ 225,000.000 in back taxes and have no funding for the mosque to date. Obviously receiving funding from Islamic states is out of the question.  Muslim leaders outside of the U. S. have cautioned against building the mosque: Dr. Abd al-Muti Bayumi, a prominent fellow of the Islamic Research Academy of Al Azhar, says the construction of a mosque anywhere near ground zero is the child of a "devious mentality" to connect the dots of Sept. 11 and Islam, to stoke memories of barbarism in the name of Islam. Dr. Amna Nazir, a professor of doctrine and philosophy at Al Azhar, calls  "building a mosque on this rubble indicates bad intention — even if we wished to shut our eyes, close our minds and insist on good will." ... "I say in all honesty that we recruit the people of Islam, and instill in them the spirit of the true jihad, which is death for the sake of Allah, for the sake of our faith." ============== They have every right to build the mosque, but it is in very bad taste to do so and will be seen as a provocation.
