Last year, Jiffy Lube International (JLI) served 22 million customers who did just that. Employee training and development plays a critical role in preparing 21,000 workers in more than 2,000 U.S. franchise locations to provide consistent, correct technical services with a strong focus on customer satisfaction. Although some of that training is required by the policies and procedures that govern the franchise, JLI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell Oil Corporation, doesn’t have to mandate much of it. “Training is not a hard sell,” explains Kenneth Barber, manager of learning and development for the past five years. “Franchisees are hungry for training, and just as engaged as we are. There’s no pushback.” Jiffy Lube University (JLU), branded as a corporate university in 2009, offers 10 certifications comprising 60 courses. Training courses on customer service, management, technical procedures, and service standards are based on procedures and best practices agreed to by franchisees and the business. All employees have training paths and must achieve certifications at certain milestones during their employment tenure. For example, all technicians must be certified in safety and product knowledge within 30 days after hire. They get a snapshot of their progress via the Roadmap, the learner portal in the learning management system. More than 150 hours of training are available during the employee’s first year. A gas gauge shows an employee’s progress, while store managers get color-coded LMS reports that show their location’s overall progress toward the requirements. More than 95 percent of training content is delivered online, on demand. Once a course is completed, employees take an online test to demonstrate knowledge mastery, and then managers provide on-the-job coaching to ensure learning transfer. They use Daily Training and Observation Guides created for each service. Learners must pass a proficiency exam to earn certification. “Although we have always had an extremely strong commitment to learning and development and its value proposition, that focus has become more precise over the past five years,” says Henry Flores, the organization’s chief learning officer. “We are making a significant effort to become world-class.” Barber oversees seven full-time staff members—one who manages the LMS and six trainers who travel 75 percent of the time. The six traveling trainers focus on advanced management training, which is available to assistant managers and managers in instructor-led training (ILT) classes throughout North America. These advanced management training classes last three days and include courses on leadership, goal setting, time management, finance, and people management. Initial supervisory training totals 51 hours of e-learning and classroom training. The e-learning skills are refreshed every two years, while classroom training is recertified every five years with 24 hours of training. District managers take an additional eight hours of professional skills training each year. “Our award-winning training program is an incentive for a new franchisee to join the business and is used aggressively to recruit new franchisees for the business,” says Stuart Crum, president of JLI. It also helps franchisees tackle one of their most pressing challenges: employee turnover. In retail businesses, annual employee turnover can exceed 100 percent. JLU’s web-based training reduces training costs and time, while metrics help store managers and owners identify and focus retention efforts on top performers. Progress through the Roadmap on the learner portal is an incentive to top performers to stay with JLI. “We have really begun to see increased awareness and ownership of employee training since deploying the new learner portal last December,” says Barber. “Employees can make choices on their own merit. It helps maintain interest when they can see the opportunities. We have seen a direct correlation between certification and retention.” In some locations, turnover has been reduced by more than 50 percent; it has declined system-wide each year for the past three years. Longer employee tenure facilitates integrated talent management at JLI, which counts compensation and rewards, engagement, recruitment, learning and training, and individual professional development among its practices. Each technical position has a competency structure that outlines skills and performance for associated duties and tasks. Employees and managers can assess and track progress against specific competencies that must be mastered on a defined time schedule; the learning objectives align with the competencies. “We’re very proud of JLU’s alignment with the business and with the franchise community,” says Barber, who meets with JLI’s leadership team on a regular basis and reports out to that group twice a year. To make decisions about learning and performance initiatives, the learning team works with the Franchisee Training Committee, which includes eight franchise representatives. They convene for two-day meetings twice a year, and Barber conducts monthly conference calls with the committee. The committee reviews current operational practices, makes recommendations for changes, and sets priorities based on the best use of resources. Committee members are involved in the design and development of training courses, providing subject matter experts who help define the content. Courses are reviewed by stakeholders at three points in the development process. “This joint ownership is really critical,” says Barber. “When a new course goes out on JLU, franchisees know that they have all helped to develop it.” Last year, Barber and his team performed a complete evaluation of the corporate university, including all e-learning and ILT courses. He cites this effort as his team’s most innovative learning initiative of the past 12 months. JLU tweaked everything, from its classroom PowerPoint slides to online course materials, as well as the standards to which learning team members perform. Feedback from employees and customers has been positive. Customer satisfaction surveys include a question about customers’ perception of employee training; positive responses have improved from 87.9 percent in 2005 to 94 percent in 2010. “Our goal was to improve alignment with the organization, incorporate best practices in adult learning techniques, and increase training effectiveness for every learner,” he says. “We all tend to get too comfortable and to develop blind spots.” By the way, JLI no longer recommends oil changes every 3,000 miles for all cars. Rather, it has moved to a schedule based on manufacturer recommendations and the customer’s assessment of his driving conditions, from normal to severe. Training played an integral part in that culture shift because employees have been trained to guide customers through that assessment by offering choices and explaining them. “[The service] intervals have actually shortened,” says Barber. “Customers appreciate our honesty and are pleased that they are in control. It’s a leadership position that we have taken.” Jennifer J.
