Senator Reid then proceeded to lie : "It's time we return to the type of fiscal discipline that democrats brought to Washington in the 90's when democrats in the Congress and White House balanced the budget and used the surplus to do what Mr. President? To pay down the debt."  We have covered this lie about the surplus which Jim Moran told last September  here ,  here , and  here . truth is, it was Republicans NOT Democrats who balanced the budget in the 90's.
