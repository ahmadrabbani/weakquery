Jim Moran listen to Bob Barker at a Capitol Hill press conference Wednesday asking for traveling circuses to stop using exotic animals. (Paul Morigi / WireImage)    In celebvocacy, there are the stars who put on business suits and woodenly read statements — and then there are the pros.  Bob Barker , legendary “Price is Right” host and animal rights activist, sat quietly as experts made their case for banning elephants, tigers and lions from circuses. The Rayburn conference room finally lit up when Barker, 87, leaned forward to speak.  “Exotic animals cannot be healthy and can’t even approach being happy in a traveling circus,” he said in that grandfatherly game show voice, ticking off a litany of animal abuses. “They never know a day that is really pleasurable. We all have problems, but we all have good days. These animals don’t have good days.” Barker retired four years ago and now devotes most of his time to animal welfare. He came to Washington to support the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act, which would pull wild animals from circuses because of cramped trailers, tiny cages and constant travel.     Barker was flanked by sponsor Rep.  Jim Moran (D-Va.), “CSI” actress  Jorja Fox  and reps for Animal Defenders International and the Performing Animal Welfare Society. Moran conceded that he’s “not extraordinarily optimistic” that the bill will be passed anytime soon.   Ringling Bros. owner Ken Feld outside District Court in Washington earlier this year. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press)   Things got interesting when the congressman singled out corporate constituent  Ken Feld , owner of Vienna-based Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Moran told reporters it would be useful if Feld got involved “in a constructive way” to ensure the animals were treated humanely. Feld Entertainment shot back in a statement Wednesday calling the bill “baseless” and blasting Moran for pandering to activists and risking the jobs of the 750 employees who work for the “family -owned business.” The company claimed it adheres to animal husbandry best practices, and said its reps were barred from the press conference and meetings with the congressman.  Moran spokeswoman  Anne Hughes  told us that his staff met with Feld’s team last week and that she was unaware of anyone being turned away from the public press conference. “This legislation is a matter of public safety and the humane treatment of animals,” said Hughes. “If the bill puts an end to the hiring of individuals who are mistreating these intelligent and beautiful creatures, I would consider it a success.”  Read also : Circus siblings Karen Feld and Kenneth Feld’s explosive family feud blows up again in federal court , 5/21/11  Feld jury declares no winner in family fracas case , 5/24/11   By   The Reliable Source   |   05:47 PM ET, 11/02/2011  Categories:   Celebvocate ,  Politics          Tumblr  Reddit  Stumbleupon  Digg  Delicious              Previous:  Read this: Teaching Jay-Z; Mac MacGarry; Indian ambassador   Next:  Quoted: Princess Charlene on ‘delirious’ rumors about her marriage       Weigh In   Discussion Policy    About Discussions, Badges         Newest first  Oldest first  Most Recommended first          SuperFan Badge SuperFan badge holders consistently post smart, timely comments about Washington area sports and teams.
