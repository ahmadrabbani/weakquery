 Newsflash: Rep. Jim Moran in - Catholic Light

      Newsflash: Rep. Jim Moran in  April 10, 2003 10:08 AM       Newsflash:  Rep. Jim Moran in trouble again!  A Jewish civil rights organization and some Alexandria Democrats have criticized Rep. James P. Moran Jr. (D-Va.) for suggesting at a recent party meeting that a major American pro-Israel lobbying group will raise $2 million and "take over" efforts to unseat him next year. David Friedman, D.C. regional director for the Anti-Defamation League, said Moran's remarks were divisive and intended to isolate and exaggerate the role of his Jewish critics: "This only confirms what we already knew: that Jim Moran is a bigoted man who perpetuates age-old canards and stereotypes about Jews."
