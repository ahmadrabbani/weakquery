 Infidel Bloggers Alliance: Congressman Jim Moran Talks to Arab TV

                     Friday, January 28, 2011  Congressman Jim Moran Talks to Arab TV   And denounces those who oppose Obama's agenda as racists.   From   Politico :  Speaking to Arab television network Alhurra, Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.) said Republicans made big gains in November in part because “a lot of people in this country … don’t want to be governed by an African-American.” Even more objectionable to some Americans, he said, is that Obama is a black president “who is inclusive, who is liberal, who wants to spend money on everyone and who wants to reach out to include everyone in our society — that’s a basic philosophical clash.” Moran’s remarks came Tuesday in an interview conducted after Obama delivered his State of the Union speech. Democrats,  Moran said, lost for “the same reason the Civil War Happened in the United States … the Southern states, particularly the slaveholding states, didn’t want to see a president who was opposed to slavery.” Virginia, of course, is one of those Southern, formerly slaveholding states....    Thus, Moran is promoting white guilt.  The Civil War is over. Sure, racism still exists in the United States. There's no denying that fact. But to attribute the results of the 2010 elections exclusively to racism is inaccurate and denial of the will of the American people as they exercised that will at the ballot box last November. Besides, the district from which Moran runs for office is overwhelmingly white (liberal), and Democrat Moran got re-elected. Or maybe Moran has decided that Virginia, particularly Northern Virginia is not part of the South - never mind that slaves were indeed held in bondage here in Northern Virginia. And what the hell is Moran doing talking to Arab television, anyway? Following Obama's   lead  , I suppose. Obama spoke with  al-Arabiya in one of his first interviews after taking office in January 2009. Here in Northern Virginia, Congressman Moran sometimes runs for office without opposition. And when an opponent does challenge Moran for that particular seat in Congress, Moran trounces him. Never mind Moran's frequent off-the-cuff remarks: Moran has gotten in trouble for his off-the-cuff remarks in the past.  In 2007, he alleged that the “extraordinarily powerful” pro-Israel lobby played a major role in promoting the U.S. war in Iraq. A strong supporter of his district’s Muslim community , Moran faced criticism from Jewish groups in 2003 for saying that then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was visiting Washington “probably seeking a warrant from President Bush to kill at will with weapons we’ve paid for.”   Moran is standing by his recent statements about Obama and racist America.
