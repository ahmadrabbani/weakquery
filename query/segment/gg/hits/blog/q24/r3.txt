Wow. I'm pretty suprised how many other people (that live in NJ, like myself) took the time to try to find a fricken Sonic because of those damn commercials. I wanted a smoothie so bad!! They look so yummy!! But now i realize that i would practically have to buy a plane ticket to get to one. How frustrating!! Whoever is incharge of their advertising is a jerk...and a tease! Now i'm gonna yell at the tv whenever one of those pointless commercials comes on.    4/15/2006 2:00 PM               Beth said...  Come on Sonic! South Jersey is obviously responding to your commercials! Now give us a Sonic!    4/23/2006 9:40 PM             Anonymous said...  Sonic is now in Pennsylvania (one step closer for us Jersey folk). I recently read that 10-15 Sonics will be opening up in the Chester/Lancaster areas throughout the summer and into the fall. One has already opened in Ephrata, PA.    4/26/2006 11:01 AM             I NEED SONIC IN NORTH EAST said...  WHY?!?!?!?! Why would you put CONSTANT commercials of AMAZING SONIC GOODNESS on EVERY CHANNEL on Cable in New Jersey. Its like advertising for Ski Resort Tickets on a Beach in Southern California. I want a BREAKFAST SANDWICH!!!! If any NJ-ians find a Sonic around do tell.    5/04/2006 10:09 PM             Jane E. NJ said...  The folks at Sonic aren't very frugal with their advertising budget. Why advertise in a state (NJ) that doesn't have even one Sonic? The closest Sonic is 246 miles away, in Ephrata, Pennsylvania! In the meantime, if you want the drink recipes, get "Top Secret Recipes; sodas, smoothies, spirits & shakes" by Todd Wilbur. They're in the book.    5/13/2006 4:11 PM             Anonymous said...  For anyone in NJ who would like to find a Sonic, you can drive to Salisbury, MD, and nearer to Dover,DE to find one. Came back from Williamsburg via Rt. 13, and found two!!!!! Posted this on 5/18/06, so there's hope yet (maybe!). I agree that those commercials are a tease. Had to stop when I saw Sonic just for the experience.    5/18/2006 4:06 PM             Anonymous said...  From Cleveland Ohio... we all have seen the ads for all the goodies Sonic's puts out, but we have noway of getting them, we can't find one to go to.

Bad luck for them, I suppose.    5/31/2006 10:00 PM             Anonymous said...  closest sonic (that i know of and actually been to) is in bridgeville, de off of route 13 north. i also here there's one in scranton, pa. im from nj so after all the commercials ive seen for the past 2-3 years or so, we just had to stop by. the drinks are amazing..the food is delicious..and the prices, extremely low - you get a lot for your money. go take a road trip there fellow new jerseyans..its worth the trip    6/11/2006 6:41 PM             Anonymous said...  So is everyone living in New York just screwed then? We have to watch all those commercials with our tongues hanging out. At least you guys in New Jersey have a shot at getting one.

I cant beleive how many New Jersey people are looking for a sonic, I too have seen the commercials and thought we would take a drive if we could find one. Guess thats not gonna happen anytime soon. But in Vineland NJ there is a Coldstone creamery, that is awesome ice cream. So if you are close, it is well worth the trip. C. Martin NJ    7/29/2006 3:21 PM             Anonymous said...  Listen Folks. It's not just the Jersey folks who are craving sonic. I live in Manhattan, the one place you're supposed to find everything, and they advertise there too. But no Sonic in New York. We should all get together and collectively tell Sonic they need to open a restaurant in the North East. At least one in the tri-state area. Pleeeeease.    7/30/2006 10:08 PM             Robert Salender said...  There's a Coldstone in Princeton too...

My wife knows alot of real estate and chamber of commerce people in Howell, and word on the street is there is an application for a Sonic on Route 9 in Howell. It's not approved yet, and folks think it will meet some opposition by residents because of traffic and other things, but I'm hopeful it will pass...keeping my fiingers crossed as we live in the next town over. There's also a nice car show every Sat. nite across the street from the proposed site.    11/20/2006 6:53 AM             Anonymous said...  Got hooked on Sonic while on vacation down South.

Cable advertisements are not local advertisements. therefore if a company advertises on a cable network it is broadcast nationwide and therefore will reach their audience in their area. It will however also reach those outside of their area but expect most people to be reasonable enough to understand how cable broadcasting works. There is a Sonic in Ephrata PA and they are building on in Elverson PA if that helps any of you NJ folks. But up until recently Sonic was only in places south of the mason dixon. It's a regional thing...those that are so upset should consider starting a franchise locally! I'm thrilled about the one opening in Elverson as I am addicted to Cherry Limes when we visit family in NM, now I can find one semi locally! - friendly voice from PA offering a bit of logic and reasoning...    1/02/2007 8:15 AM             Anonymous said...

Talked to one of the franchisee's there directing traffic and he told me of a brandy new Sonic right off the PATP at Morgantown.

But that was all they knew about in the works.    4/11/2007 10:30 AM             Anonymous said...  Since 2004 my boyfriend and I have understood the greatness of Sonic. We actually planned a weekend trip to a Sonic and we figured since traveling down south to the closest Sonic (at that time it was Virginia) we figured why not stop at Virginia Beach and make it more of a real vacation? Our second trip in 2005 led us to Myrtle Beach (mission was again Sonic) This time for 4 days and everyday we did enjoy the amazing taste of the Sonic Burger and cheese fries. Last year (2006) while my bf was in PA picking up a quad for his friend they passed a Sonic and unfortunately did not stop for the amazing taste. He told me as soon as he got home that he had seen the sign for Sonic so I looked on the website to find the location. I couldnt find it under the Sonic locator and therefore doubted his sighting. Luckily, only 2 months later he himself needed to travel back to the same bike shop to pick up a dirtbike for himself. I took off of work (because it was his birthday) and as we traveled to the bike shop I did not see any Sonic signs. But low and behold on the way back we just happened to look to our left and there it was in the red and yellow gloriousness. We pulled into the driveway and I kept yelling at him to drive faster because I felt we couldn't get there fast enough. As we saw the building with the incredible private drive thru lanes with our own personal menu, my mouth was salivating. We placed our orders and waited to experience the waiters roller skate their way to us delivering the most amazing fast food we will ever taste. Since we live in central NJ as close to the beach as you can get, we had to travel 2 and a half hours each way, but it was worth it. We had gone back with my sister and her fiancee for my birthday last year as well as a few more times after that. Now in 2007 there is a closer location in Morgantown PA (only 88 miles away as opposed to 107 miles to Ephrata PA) AND NOT TO MENTION this year, NJ will be blessed with our own Sonic goodnesses making thei way to Ocean County by June and other various locations (I believe 2 more). My bf's friend even poured the foundation for one so I know its true!! Oh and did I mention I am pregnant so you know I had my bf make the trip twice this year to allow me to partake in my craving of Sonic burgers, tots, cheese fries, and Sonic blast drinks with REAL fruit!!    4/15/2007 5:00 PM             Anonymous said...

WOW so many comments, to throw some stuff out there... the ads you see on TV even though you dont have a Sonic yet in your area are a part of a National Cable buy, so when we buy ESPN, Lifetime ect, the commercials air all over, for areas that do have Sonics, then you also get local broadcast TV. Opening in Limerick YEP look for it on or around june 6th of this year, hey you can keep coming to Morgantown also though, they still need the love.! Also dont be surprised to find new Sonics in Mt Joy and Oxford PA popping up later this year, in fact you can expect about 3-4 a year for the next 5 years.

To all of you Jersey residents...I know what you are talking about. I live around Detroit Michigan and we constantly saw TV commercials for Sonic but when we looked for one here there weren't any. The closest was in southern Ohio. BUT we now have one opened and 14 more to come thanks to two local men. So, be patient, I'm sure they are coming. One thing you can do is do a search for petitions to get them to open one in your area. I saw where some people had done that. GOOD LUCK!!

I do not have CATV/coaxial pay TV service so that has nothing to do with the Ads. I did some basic research and SONIC is quite a large company that has company owned and franchised locations in ALMOST all of the USA but not the LITERAL top part of the country including New England, Mich. and all states to the left. At first I thought it may have to do with colder weather in those areas however it looks like they broke out from Texas mostly and that surounding area is the primary marketing area then all other areas around it are developing areas with much lower unit counts. The top of the country is listed as "not available" and not a market area other then Massachusetts(still no location but available to franchise). NJ and PA had been added recently. Below is a link to Sonics markets, all we can do is wait until those markets are available or contact Sonics with the funds to create an interest for them. I for one would love to see a location in New Hampshire(perhaps near the New Hampshire Motor Speedway, in Concord, NH) http://www.sonicdrivein.com/business/franchise/marketMap.jsp    6/03/2008 2:08 PM             Anonymous said...  One thing that may slow openings of Sonics in CERTAIN areas is that the franchisee MUST agree to open at least TWO units so no one can say "I want to open one location in XYZ". Just a thought but it does make good business sense for Sonics HQ.    6/03/2008 2:15 PM             Anonymous said...  Heard their opening a Sonic in Howell, NJ soon. Will be about a half hour north of the one in Waretown but also off of Rt9. Sucks they can only have them in Central/South Jersey(???).Guess it makes the hour drive that much more special.

Sonic Millville New Jersey store manager is a hateful person and should not be employeed. Sunday july 27,2008 he started to scream at me and my partner in our car because we drove around the store and waited for a parking space. He came up to the car hitting the roof of the car and windows screaming to get out of here. I put down the window and told to stop screaming but he did not stop. I told I was a new customer and had never been there before and I did not know how it working, He said HE didn't care and to get out of there. I have never been treated like that in my life. He may scream at his wife & kids like that but not me. Then a customer got involved telling us to go back to our country but we are both americans, 1 white and 1 asian, and when this hate crime happen the manager help her get our plated number on the car, I hoped the police did come but manager and customer are just talk and hateful people. So as I looked around at other employees I did not see any other race but white. so please think before you eat there, HE may attack you too.    7/28/2008 6:47 AM               Joe said...

Just to clear up some rumors... the first Sonic in Bulington County will be opening next year in Hainesport, NJ on route 38. There is a sign on rt. 541 but that is only our office. Sorry. We received approval from the township last week and we are completely thrilled to have the opportunity to bring Sonic to Burlington County. If anyone has any questions or is interested in an exciting career opportunity with our franchise group, please contact me at 609.458.5798. To date there are three drive-ins operating in New Jersey. The first is in Waretown, NJ on route 9. The second is off Delsea Drive in Millville, NJ and the most recent is on Route 9 in Rio Grande, NJ right in front of Lowes. To find other locations or to learn more about Sonic, please check out their website at www.sonicdrivein.com. Thanks again and all the best, Nolan Aspell Sonic Drive-In Franchisee 609.458.5798    9/10/2008 10:05 AM               Debit1351 said...  All right Northeast Ohio!!! We finally have a Sonic!!! Our Sonic Drive-in should be opening very soon (saw an ad in the Plain Dealer Saturday 9/13/08) in Streetsboro. I have been addicted to Sonic since the 1970's when I visited my Grandparents in Oklahoma. Turned my husband on to them when we visited in 2004. Whenever we travel, we look for a Sonic so that we can get "our fix". Thank you Sonic, for finally hearing our pleas!!!!!!!    9/15/2008 11:36 AM             Anonymous said...  A sonic is northern NJ is now coming. Word around the block from some very reliable sources is that a permit was applied for in June of this year, and was finally approved. The new address of this sonic will be something like 242-244 US-46W, Totowa NJ 07512, I believe. If you go to google maps and type in the address, it will show a building that has been abandoned for years, and it makes perfect sense. For locals, its in the building where "The Lantern" used to be, right next to mens warehouse.    10/12/2008 1:09 AM             Anonymous said...  Hi,I would like too find a Sonic in Washington by Seattle sense I left Texas I sure do miss my peach Tea and some I did see there were some over in Eastern Washington but too far, im fixing too go back down South in a few months  Sandra    10/28/2008 7:06 PM               David said...  Is that true? A Sonic is coming soon to the north Jersey area of Totowa? Question is when is it coming? Totowa sounds fine since it's only about a half an hour or so from my hometown of Millburn. But I wish there were some nearby me on Rt. 10 and Rt. 22. Those areas could use one to. How about opening one at one of the closed down gas stations on Rt. 10.    11/04/2008 10:56 PM             UncleMark said...  The Sonic at 4023 W. 167th St. in Country Club Hills, Illinois is now open. The phone number to the restaurant is (708)-798-4204. It has been open since Monday, November 10th.

To the ones from Washington State: I live in Tacoma, and yes there is too one in Eastern Washington. It's in Spokane, basically across the street from Gonzaga. Off the freeway, but definitely worth it if your traveling through. I stop all the time when I'm there!  I also heard from an employee there that they are putting one up in this area, apparently in Puyallup. Supposedly in December. I haven't seen anything about it here locally, so I don't know if it's true or not. Hope so!    11/28/2008 11:57 PM               tcoad said...  I'm from NJ... Went to PA just pass the toll on 78.

I ate there for the first time this past Sunday 1/18 and the food was hot and the service was fast. All the drive up car stalls were filled when I got there at 2:15PM. All drinks are 1/2 price between 2-4 PM daily and the cherry limeaide I had was really good. I also had their $1.00 burger off of their dollar menu and my wife had the Jr. Burrito. If you're in the area please stop by and support our new Sonic Drive-In. UncleMark    1/21/2009 12:30 PM             USAFMA2 said...

There's a Sonic in PA, not 10 hours away, but it is in Bethlehem I believe. I've been there a bunch of times (it's on Street Road next to Golden Corral). It's super close to Central Jersey (I go to TCNJ and make trips with my friends frequently) and is about a 2 hr drive from my mom's house in Bergen County, NJ.    4/11/2009 10:32 AM             Anonymous said...

LOL there are 170+ comments on this post and 50%+ of them are people saying "hey how come there is no Sonic in NJ/NY?" wtf, people learn how to use Google, it's not hard. NJ: As of right now there is only ONE Sonic location in NJ, it is: 566 Route 9, Waretown, NJ‎ - (609) 971-8700‎. (for those in northern jersey there are a few in eastern PA that are probably closer) NY: They just finnished building and staffing the ONE Sonic location in NY, it is opening May 6th. Loc: 251 Miron Lane, Kingston, NY. DONT BE LAZY/STUPID, USE GOOGLE.    5/01/2009 10:03 AM             Anonymous said...  I drive on Route 46 East in Totowa everyday and a Sonic is definitely being built! The frame work is up and I saw a sign today that it is going to be a Sonic (just not sure when it will be opening).

I can't take it anymore. Driving 40+ minutes to get to a Sonic. If anyone is smart, there needs to be a Sonic in CENTRAL Jersey. I'm talking Middlesex County. We have a huge population in this area. Everyone I know thinks it's a pain in the ass to drive 40+ miles north, or 40+ south to go to a Sonic. Please, please please open one in East Brunswick or New Brunswick.    6/19/2009 4:02 PM             Anonymous said...  they put the ads on tv the minute the sonic chain was in negotiations to come to new jersey. there is one on rt 9 in waretown, another on rt 9 in howell nj (opening soon) and i believe another somewhere up around the region of wayne, or hackensack. only the waretown location currently shows up in the store locator search on sonic's website.    6/22/2009 3:27 PM               Brian said...  There's one that's supposed to open up in Howell within the next month or so. The NJ Sonic myspace page says June, so probably this weekend or 4th of july weekend. The one on 46 in Totowa is basically finished, and will probably open 4th of July weekend. That should alleviate the lines at the Rt. 17 location.    6/24/2009 9:45 PM               Alex said...

We went last night and brought it home only to have a chicken sandwich instead of a cheese burger and then a cheesebuger with only the bread, lettuce and bacon - no burger!!! I am sure it is all good - but just way too many orders for such a new joint.    7/07/2009 7:31 PM             Anonymous said...  Tried going to the Totowa, NJ location today. So crowded. Traffic director directed us in, through the parking lot and right back out onto Rt 46. Very disappointed. Didn't even get any food. :(    7/11/2009 6:52 PM             Anonymous said...
