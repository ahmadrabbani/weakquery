The move is part of a  formal commitment to deepen collaborative efforts between Mayo Clinic and ASU in health care, medical research and education. Some of joint efforts include a nursing eduation program, faculty appointments, dual degree programs, and a variety of collaborative research projects. The two organizations also are jointly working on a new proton beam program. ASU and Mayo have worked on several projects together over the past eight years, and are in early talks about the possibility of developing a joint medical school, according to  John Noseworthy , president and CEO of Mayo Clinic. Biomedical informatics combines information science, computer science and health care. It deals with the resources, devices and methods needed to optimize the acquisition, storage, retrieval and use of health and biomedical information to enhance patient care. Last year ASU pulled out of a partnership with University of Arizona to jointly operate the UA College of Medicine to Phoenix on the downtown Phoenix Biomedical Campus. This summer,  UA signed a deal with  Maricopa Integrated Health System            Maricopa Integrated Health System   Latest from The Business Journals   Marilyn Seymann honored by Arizona Women's Education and Employment group    State may let insurers bid for mental health contract    Phoenix Business Journal names 2011 Health Care Heroes    Follow this company       , making MIHS the university’s primary training, teaching and research hospital.
