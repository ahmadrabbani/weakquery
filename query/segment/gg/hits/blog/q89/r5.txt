Meant to help consumers manage their own health, the "Create your own Mayo Clinic Health Experience," will open its doors at 10 a.m. Thursday morning. "What we are trying to create is an opportunity for people to engage in their health and wellness at a level they are comfortable with," said James Yolch, Mayo Clinic Administrator. Mayo Clinic is also hoping to learn from the shoppers who stop in at the center, which contains cutting edge technology. "This space, as far as we're concerned, it's a laboratory," said Dr. David Hayes, Medical Director for the Mall of America Project. Mayo Clinic will do its research by talking to shoppers about their health needs. They will use that information to form a more clinical area at the mall this fall where they will offer medical services like women's preventive health care, dermatology screening and sports medicine. "These are services that based on our homework, people have told us that they think they would be interested in in this environment. Where they can do it conveniently, and get the information they need for a busy lifestyle," Hayes said. The clinical portion is expected to open its doors next month.
