Mayo staff, including doctors and nurses, are singing and dancing in this video. Their goal is to get you to learn your blood pressure, lipids, and body mass index. The video will be unveiled today at the Mayo Clinic’s third annual Social Media Summit in Rochester. Mayo Clinic hopes that soon the world will be singing along since the video will be available on YouTube.   Tweet          Most Read Stories 1 Dead After Officer-Involved Shooting in Roseville  Authorities ID Driver in Fatal I-94 Accident  New Vikings Stadium Could Rock Basilica  Woman Killed After Lying Down in I-94 Traffic  East Bethel Horse Owner: 'I'm Not Doing Anything Wrong'  Big Tax Cuts for Small City in Anoka County  New Top Cop at DHS: 'I'm a Watchdog' for Taxpayers  Before You Shop: What to Know About Black Friday Deals  Wis.
