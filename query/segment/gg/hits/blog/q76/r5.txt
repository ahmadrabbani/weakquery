 The Politics of the Cross Resurrected: Biden on China's One Child Policy: A Shameful Way to Ingratiate Yourself to Dictators and Murderers

      skip to main  |  skip to sidebar  The Politics of the Cross Resurrected   "Even the cross . . . was a judgment seat. For the Judge was set up in the middle with the thief who believed and was pardoned on the one side and the thief who mocked and was damned on the other. Already then he signified what he would do with the living and the dead: some he will place on his right hand, others on his left." - St. Augustine (Tractates on the Gospel of John 31:11) "For as the Son was judged as a man, he shall also judge in human form." - St. Augustine (City of God, 20.30)         Tuesday, August 23, 2011   Biden on China's One Child Policy: A Shameful Way to Ingratiate Yourself to Dictators and Murderers    In 2008 I wrote on this blob that if left-wingers like Jim Wallis and Brian McLaren got their way and Barack Obama was elected, the outcome would be that the wars they supposedly opposed would continue in the same way as if a Republican and, in addition, we would get the most pro-abortion administration in American history. Well, three years later Obama is involved in three wars, which is one  more than George W. Bush was involved in. But the anti-war rhetoric from the anti-war Left has been moderated considerably, actually pretty much abandoned.  Still, the Evangelical Left (which purports to care about women, children and the poor so much) can take pride in one accomplishment: they got a Vice President who went to China and assured the Communist dictators that their coercive one-child policy is just fine by him. This is an improvement on George W. Bush? No, it is a moral embarrassment to all who care about oppressed women and unborn children.  Here are  some excerpts from Joe Biden's speech on Aug. 21: [Warning: contains extreme moral relativism instead of the usual Biden profanity]  China has followed a very different economic and political path to prosperity, enhancing some aspects of a free-market system, while resisting political openness and maintaining the state’s deep involvement in economic affairs. That's a decision for you to make. What is a little thing like human dignity and liberty between trading partners?  Maybe the biggest difference in our respective approaches are our approaches to what we refer to as human rights. I recognize that many of you in this auditorium see our advocacy of human rights as at best an intrusion, and at worst an assault on your sovereignty. I want to tell you directly that this is not our intention. Yes, for Americans there is a significant moral component to our advocacy. And we observed where we have failed, as well. But it is who our people are. "What we refer to as human rights"? What the heck is he trying to say? "It is who our people are"? Sounds like a concern for human rights is an American quirk that other nations cannot be expected to care about. Well, that sets up the context pretty well for the big bombshell:  In answer to a student's question about the US debt, Biden said:   What we ended up doing is setting up a system whereby we did cut by $1.2 trillion upfront, the deficit over the next 10 years. And we set up a group of senators that have to come up with another $1.2 to $1.7 trillion in savings or automatically there will be cuts that go into effect in January to get those savings. So the savings will be accomplished. But as I was talking to some of your leaders, you share a similar concern here in China. You have no safety net.  Your policy has been one which I fully understand -- I’m not second-guessing -- of one child per family.  The result being that you’re in a position where one wage earner will be taking care of four retired people. Not sustainable.  So hopefully we can act in a way on a problem that's much less severe than yours, and maybe we can learn together from how we can do that. [my bolding]     Maybe we can learn from China and its one-child policy? This guy is a disgrace to his religion (he is Roman Catholic), to his country and to his office.  Rep. Chris Smith, a stalwart pro-life leader in the House of Representatives was interviewed by Laura Ingrham on this issue. Here is a clip of the interview.     Here are some of Smith's remarks from the show transcript:   This is just exposing what this administration has been doing from day one. Just like the eight years of the Clinton administration, and that is to enable dictatorship, to enable forced abortion and forced sterilization. Let's not forget that at the      Nuremburg War Crimes Tribunal   ​  , forced abortion was properly construed to be a crime against humanity. It is no less a crime against humanity today and there is our Vice President saying that he fully understands the one child per couple policy that has made brothers and sisters illegal in China. ...     Hillary Clinton   ​  , en route to Beijing, after being selected as secretary of state, said, I'm not going to allow human rights to interfere -- her words -- with selling or peddling our debt, as well as global warming.  Obama -- when he had      Hu Jintao   ​  in town, who ought to be held for genocide and crimes against humanity at the world court, he said nothing, had a state dinner for this man who ought to be behind bars, be held to account for these atrocities, including those focused on women.    Obama, Biden, Clinton - none of them care about the rights of women and children. They ought to be ashamed of themselves and no Christian ought to have anything whatsoever to do with supporting politicians like them.

The Goal of This Blog Having been influenced over the past two decades primarily by Karl Barth and John Howard Yoder, I have recently been reading St. Augustine, Dostoevesky, Solzhenitsyn, Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. I am trying to be a catholic Evangelical and am finding myself becoming more conservative in both politics and theology in the process. As I re-launch this blog, the goal is to "think out loud" about what it means to be faithful to Jesus Christ in the midst of the culture of death that is so prevalent in the modern West. In particular, I want to think about the relationship of the thought of St. Augustine and that of John Howard Yoder. Yoder has been influential on my thinking for over 15 years, but I have become convinced that in order to critique modernity effectively we must go back to the pre-modern giants of the Faith and recover Augustinian - Thomistic classical orthodoxy. If we do that, do we have to abandon Yoder's theology? Is Yoder determined by modernity, despite his best intentions? Or do St. Augustine and Yoder have much more in common than one might think?           About Me Craig Carter   Toronto, Ontario, Canada I teach theology and ethics at Tyndale University College in Toronto and I serve part-time as "Theologian in Residence" at Westney Heights Baptist Church. I firmly believe that theology is done from and for the Church and is for the people of God, not for an academic elite alone. In 2001 I published "The Politics of the Cross: The Theology and Social Ethics of John Howard Yoder" and in 2005 I published: "Rethinking Christ and Culture: A Post-Christendom Perspective." I am currently at work on a book on the doctrine of God with a (new) working title: "The Triune God and the Acids of Modernity."
