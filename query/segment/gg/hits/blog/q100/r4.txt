Publication:   Private Label Buyer Publication Date:  01-JUN-02  Format: Online Delivery: Immediate Online Access   Full Article Title: Trader Joe''s is not your ''average Joe!'' With perhaps 85% of sales coming from private label, this secretive bi-coastal chain has a playful -- and highly effective -- formula. (Trader Joes).(Trader Joe''s Co.)(Brief Article)(Company Profile)(Statistical Data Included)         Article Excerpt One day a few years ago, a guy at a Boston financial firm called up Trader Joe's headquarters and said he'd like to tour a store with a group of visiting Japanese investors. The brass at Trader Joe's was blunt: "You can't come." Not "We'd rather you didn't," or "Please don't." The visit was officially forbidden.  This led to a predictable go-round about it being a free country and all, and Trader Joe's finally said okay, okay, you can come, but you don't get a tour. And as the investment company guy tells it, the tension in the air during the visit was thick enough to cut with a machete.  Well, you probably can't blame the folk at Trader Joe's. They've got a phenomenal thing going, and don't want to give it all away. Some observers think that sales per square foot at Trader Joe's are hovering at about $1,000 -- twice the level of typical supermarkets. And with between about 70% to 85% of its products being private label (depending on who you ask), Trader Joe's has reached a benchmark others don't even dream about on good nights.  Fast Turns  Last year the Pasadena, Calif .-based chain's stores -- believed to be approaching 200 units primarily on the East and West coasts -- turned in about $1 billion in sales, with profits said to be just shy of spectacular. Stores have no service departments and small footprints -- usually about 9,500 square feet "to keep the shopping experience intimate," some say. The total SKU count, designed for fast-turn of high-margin items, is generally estimated at 2,500 to 3,000. (Trader Joe's has in the past admitted to having "more than 800" private label products, but how many "more" is an open question.)  By now, you may have noticed some vagueness on the numbers. Sorry, can't help you. It's because trading partners, consultants, competitors, analysts and about 13,000 Web sites all offer different numbers and viewpoints about this extremely private -- and much loved -- company.  Actually, in some ways, Trader Joe's is an open book. Go to their Web site, (www.traderjoes.com) and if you drill down far enough, you're likely to find most anything. But some details are still kept pretty lowkey. A Trader Joe's flier says simply that the firm was sold in 1979 by its founder, Joe Coulombe, to a private, family-run company. True, but it still surprises people who didn't already know that the buyers were German billionaires Karl and Theo Albrecht, owners of the ALDI food chain. (We hear ALDI has the good sense to leave Trader Joe's alone.)  Anybody will tell you the folk at Trader Joe's are real regular. The brass, despite their dust-up with our financier pals from Boston, are the sort you'd be proud to count as friends. And in the stores? Cashiers will leave their registers to help you find Trader Joe's Organic Moral Fiber Cereal or Trader Jose's salsa. Clerks in Hawaiian shirts may actually be singing as they stock the shelves (honest!), and will readily offer their personal thoughts on Trader Giotto's Artichoke Antipasto or even the chain's official stance on the sale of duck meat. (And if that isn't good enough, they'll direct you to the flier, signed by Chairman/CEO Dan Bane, that explains how the chain is requiring duck farmers to certify that they are cruelty-free growers.)  A Misguided Quest  Clearly, Trader Joe's is not your average Joe. (Stole that line from www.thestandard.com, thank you!). Now, for those of you who may think we've finally lost our marbles, please understand that we're on a perhaps misguided quest to copy the writing style of Trader Joe's Fearless Flyer....
