Thanks in large part to the popular Toyota Prius, Americans see automotive gas/electric hybrid technology as at least one solution to lowering fuel costs and reducing America's dependence on foreign oil. As a bonus, hybrids have earned a reputation for cleaner tailpipe emissions as well. Despite the perceived benefits of hybrid technology, sales of these vehicles still represent only a tiny fraction of the U.S. marketplace. Americans purchased about 250,000 hybrid vehicles in 2006, accounting for just 1.5 percent of the 17,000,000 cars and trucks sold here last year. Choices, Choices           One reason hybrid sales haven't grown more quickly is the limited number of vehicles available. This list includes 14 vehicles, two of which, at the time of this writing, are not yet available, and one that can only be purchased in five states. Another reason is cost. In addition to a vehicle's conventional gasoline engine, hybrids also include a regenerative braking system that recaptures energy that is normally wasted in braking and slowing, a battery pack to store the recovered power, and one or more electric motors that assist in propelling the vehicles. Note that all the vehicles discussed here also incorporate engine shut-off technology. Very simply, these systems shut the engine off while idling to conserve fuel. Vehicles with more advanced hybrid systems may propel themselves short distances before restarting the engine, further improving fuel economy. All this additional technology adds considerably to the overall cost of hybrid vehicles.  Still, automakers are loath to be excluded from the hybrid hysteria, believing that offering such vehicles demonstrates both social responsibility as well as technical prowess. While hybrid vehicles are generally assumed to be frugal with fuel, not all hybrids are designed to be gas misers. Several hybrids, those offered by Toyota's Luxury Lexus division especially, use hybrid technology primarily as a means to improve performance, though fuel economy is generally improved as well. Available now or due soon are hybrid vehicles from General Motors, Ford, Honda, Nissan, and Toyota. From GM comes the Saturn Vue Green Line compact SUV. Hybrid versions of GM's Chevrolet Malibu and Saturn Aura midsize sedans are due later this year. Ford offers hybrid versions of its Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner compact SUVs. Honda's popular Civic and Accord compact and midsize cars are both offered in hybrid form. From Nissan comes the Altima hybrid, a midsize sedan. Toyota has the most hybrid offerings. The compact Prius comes only as a hybrid, while the midsize sedan Camry and midsize SUV Highlander offer both hybrid and conventional variants. From Toyota's Lexus division come the midsize GS450h sedan, the large LS600h sedan, and the RX450h midsize SUV. 2008 Chevrolet Malibu         Base Price Range: NA EPA MPG: NA Consumer Guide Observed MPG: NA  Due out this fall as part of a redesigned Malibu lineup, this hybrid incorporates the same General Motors "mild hybrid" technology as the 2007 Saturn Aura and Vue hybrids. Though specific information is not yet available, count on seeing a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine and conventional four-speed automatic transmission. While the mild hybrid arrangement still incorporates electric thrust to improve acceleration, it does not allow for electric-only running at low speeds, as do most other hybrid systems. Mild hybrid technology, however, tends to be less costly than other systems. General Motors is claiming a fuel economy improvement of up to 25 percent when compared to a similar Malibu without a hybrid drivetrain.    2008 Ford Escape Hybrid       Base Price Range: $25,075-$26,825 EPA MPG: NA Consumer Guide Observed MPG: 28.4-31.7 Though sporting new exterior styling, Escape remains mechanically unchanged for 2008. As such, Ford division's only hybrid returns largely intact. While conventional Escapes are offered in XLS, XLT, and Limited trim, the Hybrid is offered only as separate model and includes a level of equipment that closely approximates the midline XLT. Escape Hybrid incorporates a 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Front- and all-wheel drive versions are offered. A true hybrid, Escape can propel itself for short distances at low speeds using only its electric motor. Escape Hybrid is mechanically identical to the Mariner Hybrid offered by Ford's sister division Mercury.      2007 Honda Accord Hybrid         Base Price Range: $31,090-$33,090 EPA MPG: 28-35 Consumer Guide Observed MPG: 27.5  Designed as much for improved performance as for frugal operation, Accord Hybrid uses a 3.0-liter V6 at the center of its hybrid drivetrain. With 253 horsepower, the Hybrid is the most powerful model in the Accord lineup. The Accord Hybrid comes only with a conventional five-speed automatic transmission and does not allow for electric-only operation. The Hybrid is equipped similarly to the conventional topline Accord EX, though because of space consumed by the battery pack, it does without its folding rear seat.   2007 Honda Civic Hybrid       Base Price Range: $22,600-$24,350 EPA MPG: 49-51 Consumer Guide Observed MPG: 37.8-38.0 Unlike its big-brother Accord, the Honda Civic Hybrid is designed specifically for improved fuel economy. To do so, Civic has a tiny 1.3-liter four-cylinder at the heart of its hybrid drivetrain. Civic Hybrid comes only with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and will propel itself for short distances at low speeds without the aid of its gasoline engine. The Hybrid model is equipped similarly to the conventional topline Civic EX, but loses its rear disc brakes, folding rear seat, and sunroof.      2007 Lexus GS 450h         Base Price: $54,000 EPA MPG: 25-28 Consumer Guide Observed MPG: 22.7  Like its big brother the LS600h, this Lexus hybrid is designed for enhanced performance first, and improved fuel economy second. The GS450h builds its hybrid system around an already potent 3.5-liter V6. They system is coupled to a continuously variable transmission and is capable of running for brief periods of time at low speeds without the gasoline engine. The 450h caps a GS lineup that includes the non-hybrid GS350 and GS430. Like some other hybrid sedans, the GS loses some trunk space to its battery pack.    2008 Lexus LS 600h L       Base Price Range: NA EPA MPG: NA Consumer Guide Observed MPG: NA Designed with performance instead of frugality in mind, the Lexus LS 600h L promises to be the most expensive hybrid vehicle yet when it goes on sale later in 2007. The LS will also be the first hybrid based on a V8 drivetrain.  The hybrid boosted V8 is expected to produce in excess of 430 horsepower. Based on the Consumer Guide Best Buy Lexus LS, the hybrid 600h will be available only with the model's long-wheelbase L body. The LS 600h L should start around $100,000.      2008 Lexus RX 400h         Base Price Range: $41,180-$42,580 EPA MPG: 27-33 Consumer Guide Observed MPG: NA  Lexus's crossover midsize SUV was updated for 2008, getting fresh exterior styling but remaining mechanically unchanged. Like the similar Toyota Highlander Hybrid, the 400h hybrid powertrain centers around a 3.3-liter V6 and includes a continuously variable transmission. The 400h is capable of covering short distances in electric-only mode. Front- and all-wheel drive versions are offered. Note that like the Highlander Hybrid, AWD models feature rear wheels that are driven only by the hybrid system's electric motors; there is no mechanical connection to the transmission. The RX400h is equipped similarly to the conventional gas-engined RX350, but loses that model's standard rear-wood trim and tachometer.    2008 Mercury Mariner Hybrid       Base Price Range: $25,765-$27,515 EPA MPG: NA Consumer Guide Observed MPG: 24.8-28.8 Though sporting new exterior styling, Mariner remains mechanically unchanged for 2008. As such, Mercury's twin to the Ford Escape returns largely intact. While conventional Mariners are offered in Base and Premier trim, the Hybrid is offered as separate model and includes a level of equipment that closely approximates the topline Premier. Like Ford Escape Hybrid, Mariner Hybrid incorporates a 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Front- and all-wheel drive versions are offered. Mariner can propel itself for short distances at low speeds using only its electric motor.      2007 Nissan Altima Hybrid         Base Price: $24,400 EPA MPG: 36-42 Consumer Guide Observed MPG: NA  Based on its popular midsize Altima sedan, the 2007 Altima Hybrid is Nissan's first hybrid offering. Hedging its bets on continuing consumer demand for hybrid vehicles, Nissan has opted to offer the Altima Hybrid only in "Green States" (California, Massachusetts, Maine, New York, and Vermont). The Altima Hybrid drivetrain features a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine and a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and will operate for short periods of time at low speeds in electric-only mode. The Hybrid has roughly the same level of standard equipment as the conventional 4-cylinder Altima 2.5 S.    2007 Saturn Aura Green Line       Base Price Range:NA EPA MPG: NA Consumer Guide Observed MPG: NA Due out this summer, this hybrid incorporates the same General Motors "mild hybrid" technology as the Vue hybrid and forthcoming Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid. Though specific information is not yet available, count on seeing a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine and conventional four-speed automatic. While the mild hybrid arrangement still incorporates electric thrust to improve acceleration, it does not allow for electric-only running at low speeds, as do most other hybrid systems.      2007 Saturn Vue Green Line         Base Price: $22,370 EPA MPG: 27-32 Consumer Guide Observed MPG: 25.8-28.4  Though introduced this past fall, General Motor's first hybrid vehicle (excluding the Chevrolet Silverado that offered a hybrid variant in name only) has already gone out of production. Vue assembly-including the hybrid Green Line-ended earlier this year, but examples should still be available on dealer lots. A redesigned 2008 Vue lineup, due later in the calendar year, will include a Green Line model. Vue Green Line incorporates the same General Motors "mild hybrid" technology as the coming 2007 Saturn Aura Green Line and Vue hybrids. The hybrid drivetrain included a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine and conventional four-speed automatic. Vue Green Line is available only with front-wheel drive. While the mild hybrid arrangement still incorporates electric thrust to improve acceleration, it does not allow for electric-only running at low speeds, as do most other hybrid systems.    2008 Saturn Vue Green Line       Base Price Range: NA EPA MPG: NA Consumer Guide Observed MPG: NA Due to arrive this fall as part of a redesigned Vue line up, the next-generation Green Line will be nearly identical mechanically to the 2007 version when it launches. The addition of a new hybrid system will make its debut several months after launch. Thanks to a longer wheelbase and expanded passenger and cargo accommodations, '08 Vues move up a size class to midsize SUV from compact.      2007 Toyota Camry Hybrid         Base Price: $26,000 EPA MPG: 38-40 Consumer Guide Observed MPG: 28.6-31.2  Not content with the success of Prius, the new for 2007 Camry Hybrid gives Toyota a hybrid sedan that is more conventional in both style and design. Unlike the similar-size Honda Accord Hybrid with its sport-oriented V6 hybrid drivetrain, the Camry pursues optimal fuel economy with its 2.4-liter 4-cylinder system. The Camry Hybrid is capable of covering short distances at low speeds on only electric power. While conventional Camrys are offered in CE, LE, SE, and topline XLE trim, the Hybrid comes as a single model equipped much like the midline LE.    2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid       Base Price Range: $32,490-$36,550 EPA MPG: 27-31 Consumer Guide Observed MPG: 22.8-26.4 Highlander Hybrid has the distinction of being the only hybrid to offer three-row seating. Like the similar Lexus RX400h, the Highlander Hybrid's powertrain centers around a 3.3-liter V6 and includes a continuously variable transmission. The Highlander Hybrid is capable of covering short distances at low speeds in electric-only mode. Front- and all-wheel drive versions are offered. Note that also like the 400h, AWD models feature rear wheels that are driven only by the hybrid system's electric motors, there is no mechanical connection to the transmission. The Highlander Hybrid is offered in Base and Limited trim levels that closely parallel the content of similar conventional versions of the highlander.      2007 Toyota Prius         Base Price Range: $22,175-$23,070 EPA MPG: 51-60 Consumer Guide Observed MPG: 41.7-45.2  The original hybrid is now in its second generation and still accounting for almost half of all hybrid vehicle sales. Unlike the other vehicles on this list, the Prius was designed specifically as a hybrid and is not based on a conventionally powered vehicle. While dealers have no trouble stocking the other hybrids discussed here, the Prius has been in short supply, meaning that customers have waited weeks and months for their cars to arrive. A recent slackening in Prius demand may mean reduced wait times and manufacturer incentives for buyers. Under the hood, only the Honda Civic Hybrid has a smaller engine. Prius's hybrid system is built around a 1.5-liter 4-cylinder engine and a continuously variable transmission. Under proper conditions, Prius will operate for extended lengths of time without engaging the gasoline engine.
