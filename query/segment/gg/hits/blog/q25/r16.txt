Our current technology may not be as advanced as the dreams of Hanna-Barbera cartoons, but the strides being made with hybrid cars certainly foretell of a future we wouldn’t have dreamed of ten years ago. While  history of hybrid cars show us why hybrid cars failed in the 1920s, their future is bright this time, with new advances and manufacturers signing on for the ride every day. Here is a list of things to expect in the nearer-than-you-think future of hybrid cars: 100 miles per gallon-  Currently, manufacturers are boasting plans and testing for hybrids that can reach up to 70 miles per gallon. The newest GM model series hybrid due out in 2010 has already been tested at up to 70 miles per gallon and over the next year of development, may get even more. Lithium-Ion battery packs- We all know what lithium-ion batteries have done for our lives…we carry them on us every day. Cell phones, laptop computers, iPods and even PDAs use the technology, portability and life span of the Lithium-Ion battery to make a go-everywhere lifestyle possible for the whole world. And now, scientists are working to harness the power of Lith-Ion to change the automotive industry forever. Cars using the Lithium-Ion battery would be more efficient, accelerate more quickly to greater speeds and have a longer distance between charges/fill-ups than conventional cars, electric cars and current hybrids. And this technology would make hybrids more affordable to the general population- at the same or cheaper cost than a current conventional gas-saving vehicle. Some first generation Lithium-Ion hybrids have already been released in Japan. Room to live-  As hybrids become more advanced, they will also become easier to live with. Currently a mid-size hybrid is much smaller than its conventional counterpart making it difficult for families and big packers to purchase these vehicles. But as technology progresses, riding and storage space should open up substantially. Every manufacturer will have at least one-  At present, nearly every manufacturer has at least one hybrid in their line-up. Those who don’t, like Volkswagen, are looking at and developing plans to add hybrids to their line-ups in the near future. So don’t give up on your favorite dealer just yet. Wait 2 years and you may be surprised at the options you’ll find on the market. Less emissions- Hybrids car will become even more efficient in the next two years than they are today. This means you can do even better than the 90% hybrid cars of today offer. Unfortunately, hybrid cars will never ZE, or zero emissions because they will always use gasoline in their construction. But 95% and 99% aren’t bad. Consumers can expect the world to begin changing for the better as hybrids and other alternative-fuel vehicles hit the market and become standard throughout the world. But remember, the hybrids of the future will only succeed if consumers will buy them.
