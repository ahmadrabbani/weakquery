Camry Hybrid               -->> Hybrid Buyers Club        Do you own a Toyota Camry hybrid?   Rate your Toyota Camry hybrid today  .     Camry Hybrid at a Glance   Pros:    Great fuel economy makes this the best Camry available.    Cons:    Boring Toyota design.    Toyota Camry Hybrid, a Consumer Report's Best Value The best Camry ever. That's what the latest press reports are claiming about the 2012 Toyota Camry hybrid. With its big jump in fuel economy -- 43/39 mpg; city/hwy -- and a corresponding price reduction, the new Camry hybrid is a winner.  Those are nice facts, you say, but you're still worried about unintended acceleration?  Who wouldn't be?   Fortunately, very few Camry hybrids were outfitted with the faulty CTS accelerator petal. In fact, as few as 11 total cars were equipped with the faulty part according to     some reports   . Moreover, even the government finally concluded that the real problem was driver error, not the Camry.   Hot Camry Hybrid News    --    Toyota Camry hybrid the best Camry available     --    2012 Toyota Camry hybrid achieves 43 mpg in the city    --    Deals still available on the Toyota Camry hybrid    --      Consumer Reports - Camry hybrid a best buy, despite recalls             Still,  despite the recalls, Consumer Reports named the Toyota Camry hybrid its 10th Best Overall Value just after all the reports of runaway Toyota's filled the news. That's compared to ALL vehicles, not just hybrids. Again, CR made this pick  after the recalls and during the so-called scandal.  That does't mean that Toyota doesn't have some problems, every automaker has problems, and recalls are a normal part of the auto business. Every automaker offers advantages and disadvantages, and on the whole, most Toyota vehicles according to data from Consumer Reports and JD Power are very safe and reliable and most Toyota consumers would buy from Toyota again.   In particular, however, the Toyota Camry hybrid is one of the Best Values available - not just from Toyota, but from all automakers - but that wasn't the only interesting thing Consumer Reports found.  According to Consumer Reports, the Camry hybrid and the  Ford Fusion hybrid both averaged 34 mpg, despite the higher EPA numbers for the Fusion hybrid. And the Camry hybrid is cheaper. No doubt the Fusion hybrid is a fantastic hybrid, but the Camry hybrid is probably your better deal today. However, the upcoming  Hyundai Sonata hybrid is giving the Camry hybrid a strong run for the money.  Despite the positive ratings from the likes of Consumer Reports, the Camry hybrid is not a hot seller, even as gas prices have risen this spring. That could, however, make the Camry hybrid one of the best hybrid deals heading into the summer driving season. Quite simply, dealerships might make a deal on the Camry hybrid, but you can be sure there won't be any deals on the  Toyota Prius until gas prices crash.  Overall Toyota Camry sales have declined since the so-called recall scandal that was far overhyped in the media based on the data, including the final NHTSA report. And the Camry hybrid was hit even harder. But the facts speak for themselves.  The Camry hybrid is a great, safe buy, one currently being over-looked in the hybrid market. If gas prices keep rising, demand is sure to increase. Thus, acting now on a Camry hybrid might be the smartest hybrid move you can make today.    The Toyota Camry hybrd      The 2011 Toyota Camry hybrid is not your hippy-friend's hybrid vehicle. The Camry hybrid feels more like a luxury vehicle - leather seats, top quality stereo, etc - not some gas-sipping science experiment.    The Camry hybrid is simply the best Camry available.   The hybrid version of the Camry offers a 2.4-liter, 4-cylinder gas engine which achieves 147 horsepower with a maximum boost of 45 horsepower from the electric motor. Thus, the combined gas/electric system can temporarily produce 192 horsepower, about the same as the V-6 engine version of today’s Camry, but with better than 4 cylinder fuel economy.  The continuously variable transmission powered Camry hybrid has been estimated by the EPA to achieve 33 mpg in the city and 34 mpg on the highway. (For more on Camry hybrid fuel economy, check out our  Camry hybrid testimonials ).   However, in my Camry hybrid experiences, much better fuel economy is possible. Unlike the Prius, however, it takes a bit longer for the engine to warm up and city fuel economy can be sluggish on very short trips.  Of course, if your trip is that short, maybe you should be walking. I mean, you must be an environmentalist if you're interested in a Camry hybrid, right?  Anyway, the Camry hybrid is now produced in Kentucky, making it the first Toyota hybrid produced in the U.S.. The Kentucky plant is capable of producing more than 60,000 Camry hybrids per year.  So, if you're worried about buying a foreign-made car, at least this Toyota was assembled by American workers here in the US.  Recently, I went hybrid shopping at a Toyota dealership and I found a good selection of available Camry. And, since the gas spike of 2008, dealers seem willing to negotiate the prices on Camry hybrids.  Still, if you like the  Prius , but need a more refined ride, then the Camry hybrid could be your hybrid.  I love the moonroof on the Camry hybrid, something unavailable on the Prius, as well as the remote start. The Camry hybrid is my kind of hybrid.  Let me be honest, I love the Toyota Prius, but the Camry hybrid is just more comfortable.   The seats in the Camry hybrid are just better than the Prius and the hybrid Camry can support my bad lower back in a way the Prius just cannot achieve.  The Camry hybrid simply does not disappoint.  Yes, the Camry hybrid provides a little sticker shock when compared to the standard Camry, but if you keep the Camry hybrid for 5 to 7 years, the Camry hybrid can be a smart financial move.   And, if gas prices keep going up, or if most of your commuting is done in an urban setting, the Camry hybrid, like the Prius, can be a very wise investment and hedge against energy costs.  If you like the Toyota Camry, then you'll love the Toyota Camry hybrid.         Latest Camry Hybrid News     >     Toyota hybrid sales back on track, led by Prius and Lexus hybrids      >     2012 Toyota Camry hybrid versus 2012 Hyundai Sonata hybrid – MT      >     Does a cheaper Toyota Camry hybrid demand a cheaper Prius?      >     Toyota Camry hybrid the best Camry available      >     2012 Camry hybrid achieves 43 mpg in the city      >     Upgraded 2012 Camry hybrid coming      >     Deals still available on the Toyota Camry hybrid      >     Toyota hybrid sales down almost 9 percent in April      >     Hybrid buyers – Toyota hybrid prices set to rise in May      >     10 more new Toyota hybrids by 2015      >     Higher gas prices haven’t killed Camry hybrid car deals yet      >     Cash back for Toyota hybrid buyers     Good time to buy a Camry hybrid?      >     Toyota hybrid sales sink in August      >     Toyota preps for big increase in hybrid sales      >     Toyota hybrid patent suit over      >     Intended acceleration: Toyota hybrids were always safe?      >     Cheap insurance?
