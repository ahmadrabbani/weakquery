Their dark, neo-gothic alternative metal earned a cult following in the wake of the popularity of such likeminded bands as  Korn and  the Deftones . Vocalist  Serj Tankian , guitarist Daron Malakian, bassist Shavo Odadjian, and drummer John Dolmayan formed System of a Down in Southern California in the mid-'90s. They quickly earned a strong following in Los Angeles, largely based on strong word of mouth. A three-song demo began circulating through metal collectors, and their fan base soon spread throughout not only America, but Europe and New Zealand.  By the end of 1997, the group had signed to American, then distributed by Columbia Records. American/Columbia released the group's eponymous debut album in the summer of 1998, securing the band opening spots on the  Slayer and Ozzfest tours. System eventually went gold, and set up the September 2001 release of the even more ambitious Toxicity. System's second effort was another heavy music triumph, shaming the majority of their nu-metal competition and running away with multi-platinum honors. The quartet didn't slow down. Malakian started the eatURmusic imprint and  Tankian a label called Serjical Strike;  Tankian also collaborated with Armenian avant-garde folk musician Arto Tuncboyaciyan in a project called Serart. In November 2002 System issued the bare-bones but no less powerful odds 'n' ends set Steal This Album!; they also remained politically active.  By 2004, System of a Down was back in the studio with Rick Rubin. The bold result of those sessions was a single, epic album released in two parts. Mezmerize/Hypnotize kept System's furious creativity alive, incorporating the wild vocal melodies, lyrical passion, and rabid structural shifts that had become their trademark. Mezmerize, or part one, appeared in May 2005, while Hypnotize, its final section, appeared later in the year, and both hit the top of the album charts. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi    Latest News    Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne Sign On For One-Day Ozzfest  Posted 5/13/08    System Of A Down Guitarist Says Scars On Broadway Is No Side Project  Posted 2/19/08    Himsa  Summon Sasquatches For Video; Plus Opeth, System Of A Down & More News That Rules, In  Metal File   Posted 11/2/07     More News �   Albums    System of a Down/Steal This Album  Release Date: 4/14/08 Label: Sony Music Distribution    More Albums �          MTV Logo:   GO WEB   MUSIC |  SHOWS |  NEWS |  MOVIES |  FULL EPISODES |  TV SCHEDULE |  MUSIC VIDEOS |  MOVIE TRAILERS |  BROWSE ARTISTS A-Z |  RADIO |  ONLINE GAMES |  MOBILE |  DOWNLOAD MTV DIRECT  MTV BLOGS Labs  Buzzworthy Blog  Guys Blog  Hollywood Crush  Movies Blog  MTV Hats Blog  MTV Style  Multiplayer Blog  Newsroom  Remote Control Blog  Splash Page  You R Here Blog   MORE MTV MTV Geek!
