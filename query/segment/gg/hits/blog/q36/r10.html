</font>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm honored to be with you 
today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. 
Truth be told, I 
never graduated from college, and this is the closest I've ever 
gotten to a college graduation. Today, I want to tell you three stories from my 
life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first story is about 
connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed 
College after the first six months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for 
another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It started before I was 
born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she 
decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be 
adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at 
birth by a lawyer and his wife -- except that when I popped out they decided at 
the last minute that they really wanted a girl.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So my parents, who were on a 
waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking, &quot;We've got an 
unexpected baby boy; do you want him?&quot; They said, &quot;Of course.&quot; My biological 
mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that 
my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final 
adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised 
that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And 17 years later I did go 
to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as 
Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my 
college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea 
what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me 
figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved 
their entire life.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out 
okay. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best 
decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required 
classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked 
far more interesting.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It wasn't all romantic. I 
didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms. I returned 
coke bottles for the five cent deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 
seven miles 
across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna 
temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity 
and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Reed College at that time 
offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the 
campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand 
calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal 
classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I 
learned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif">
<font color="#0000FF">serif</font></a> and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif"><font color="#0000FF">sans-serif</font></a> typefaces, about varying the amount of space 
between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. 
It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't 
capture, and I found it fascinating.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">None of this had even a hope 
of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were 
designing the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Macintosh">
<font color="#0000FF">Macintosh computer</font></a>, it all came back to me. And we designed 
it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I 
had never dropped in on that single course in college, the &quot;Mac&quot; would have never 
had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just 
copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had 
never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class, and 
personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of 
course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in 
college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards 10 years later.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, you can't connect the 
dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have 
to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in 
something -- your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever -- because believing that 
the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your 
heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path, and that will make all the 
difference.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My second story is about 
love and loss.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was lucky 
-- I found what I 
loved to do early in life. Woz</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">¹</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and I started 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer"><font color="#0000FF">Apple</font></a> in my parents' garage when I 
was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us 
in a garage into a two billion dollar company with over 4000 employees. We'd just 
released our finest creation -- the Macintosh -- a year earlier, and I had just 
turned 30.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"> And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you 
started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to 
run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then 
our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. 
When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. And so at 30, I was out. And very 
publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it 
was devastating.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I really didn't know what to 
do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of 
entrepreneurs down -- that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. 
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so 
badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_valley"><font color="#0000FF">the valley</font></a>. But something slowly began to dawn on me: I still loved what I did. 
The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, 
but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I didn't see it then, but it 
turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever 
happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness 
of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one 
of the most creative periods of my life.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">During the next five years, 
I started a company named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">
<font color="#0000FF">NeXT</font></a>, another company named
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar"><font color="#0000FF">Pixar</font></a>, and fell in love 
with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the 
world's first computer-animated feature film, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story"><font color="#0000FF">Toy Story</font></a>, and is now the most 
successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple 
bought NeXT, and I retuned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at 
the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful 
family together.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm pretty sure none of this 
would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting 
medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometime life -- Sometimes life's 
going to hit you in the head 
with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me 
going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that is 
as true for work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a 
large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what 
you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you 
do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking -- and don't settle. As with all matters 
of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And like any great relationship, it 
just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking -- don't 
settle.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My third story is about 
death.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When I was 17, I read a 
quote that went something like: &quot;If you live each day as if it was your last, 
someday you'll most certainly be right.&quot; It made an impression on me, and since 
then, for the past 33 years, I've looked in the mirror every morning and asked 
myself: &quot;If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am 
about to do today?&quot; And whenever the answer has been &quot;No&quot; for too many days in a 
row, I know I need to change something.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Remembering that I'll be 
dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the 
big choices in life. Because almost everything -- all external expectations, all 
pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the 
face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are 
going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have 
something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your 
heart.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">About a year ago I was 
diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly 
showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The 
doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, 
and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor 
advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for 
&quot;prepare to die.&quot; It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd 
have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure 
everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your 
family. It means to say your goodbyes.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I lived with that diagnosis 
all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down 
my throat, through my stomach into my intestines, put a needle into my 
pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was 
there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors 
started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer 
that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and, thankfully, I'm fine now.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This was the closest I've 
been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades. 
Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty 
than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even 
people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is 
the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it 
should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It's 
Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now 
the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the 
old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your time is limited, so 
don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma -- which is 
living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of 
others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the 
courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you 
truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When I was young, there was 
an amazing publication called 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog">
<font color="#0000FF">The Whole Earth Catalog</font></a>, which was one of the 
&quot;bibles&quot; of my generation. It was created by a fellow named
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand"><font color="#0000FF">Stewart Brand</font></a> not far 
from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This 
was in the late 60s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it 
was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of 
like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was 
idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Stewart and his team put out 
several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, 
they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the 
back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country 
road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so 
adventurous. Beneath it were the words: &quot;Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.&quot; It was 
their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I've 
always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish 
that for you: Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.</font></p>
<p class="commencement" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you all very much.</font></p>
