Various options exist which address privacy and electronic commerce requirements and which permit, to differing degrees, lawful access to information or communications for security, law enforcement and regulatory purposes. Every option entails trade-offs borne by all stakeholders and all come at some cost, even though the costs differ for each option.   22  The requirement to balance the commercial, privacy and lawful access needs of society and its members is not new, but has assumed a more acute importance today because of recent technological developments, which impact or may soon impact both legitimate and illegitimate activities. Significant developments include the following: the increasing use of strong cryptography itself, as encryption software and computers powerful enough to encrypt and decrypt data easily are becoming commonly available; the rapidly increasing use of telecommunications media suitable for encryption (e.g. E-mail and other data conveyed via the Internet or other computer-based media), both as a means of personal communication and a means of conducting many forms of commercial communications;  the increasing use of wireless cellular telephones, which has created pressure for the development of digital equipment and lead to the encryption of their signals in some cases; and  the increasing reliance on computers and computer networks for commercial activities and the need to protect privacy and security, which has led companies to store business records in secure computer facilities or in encrypted form.   In developing a balanced policy, Canada will need to take into account the considerations discussed below. These same factors also confront other developed countries; their assessment of these factors and the policies they ultimately select will also be critical to Canada, since many of the practical applications of cryptography involve transnational communications. Electronic Commerce Considerations   As more and more transactions shift from closed networks to open networks,  23  cryptography becomes essential for the conduct of electronic commerce. Historically, most electronic commerce, such as electronic data interchange ( EDI ) or electronic funds transfer ( EFT ), has been conducted on closed networks. In a global trading environment, the full advantages of electronic commerce can only be achieved through a transition to open networks. Open networks, however, pose a variety of security challenges including concerns over the authentication of communicating parties, the integrity of data being communicated, the confidentiality of proprietary or personal data, and the assurance that transactions have been authorized by legitimate users. Without cryptography to support dependable digital signatures and strong confidentiality services packaged in a trustworthy, cost-effective and user-friendly way, these challenges may not be met. In the world of open networks and in an environment which is increasingly characterized by uncertainty and global economic competition, strong encryption enables corporations to protect themselves from competitive intelligence-gathering and criminal threats, and to protect sensitive information and communications, as in the following cases: Businesses are beginning to use the Internet for their communications and access to corporate information holdings. Businesspeople on the road as well as teleworkers often need to exchange sensitive information such as business intelligence, bidding information and marketing strategies with the home office. Encryption helps ensure that only authorized users have access to data and protect sensitive data from unauthorized viewing or malicious use.  Encryption supports the secure communications needed for virtual organizations and strategic partnerships. Many of today's businesses have offices for research and development, production, and sales in different geographic locations in Canada or abroad. In some instances, strategic partners have access to corporate databases for joint ventures and at the same time are competitors in other undertakings. A broad range of intellectual property such as trade secrets, blueprints, designs, and operational records that never before traversed open networks must now be protected.  It is becoming more common to make information, cultural products and software available directly to consumers over open networks. Satellite television and pay-TV are two examples in which encryption is being used to protect intellectual property from fraudulent or unpaid use.  If business is to be conducted on-line, consumer confidence is crucial. The willingness of consumers to make purchases over the Internet depends upon the certainty that their transactions are secure. Encryption is one means of maintaining the confidentiality of consumers' credit card numbers and other personal information. Data protection laws, which place obligations on data users to protect confidentiality, will further promote the use of encryption.  As governments increasingly move to third party and on-line delivery of services, citizens will increasingly demand the assurance that their sensitive medical, employment, revenue, and other information is protected to the greatest extent possible.   Different kinds of transactions require different kinds of solutions in order to meet these demands. Some enterprises will protect their corporate communications between branches by establishing virtual private networks or by using hardware encryptors to guarantee secure data transmission over the Internet. Other organizations, from multinationals down to medium-sized firms, may set up their own certification authorities to meet the cryptographic requirements for secure E-mail-enabled electronic commerce and a wide range of applications demanding authorization, authentication and integrity services. Among the early adopters in this regard are banks, which are establishing their own CAs in order to provide home banking over the Internet, and financial institutions, which have implemented the Secure Electronic Transaction ( SET ) protocol for credit card transactions. Other businesses may choose to out-source to cryptography service providers, which offer a suite of certificate-based services supporting a full range of authentication, non-repudiation, integrity and confidentiality functions. In fact, certification authorities offering services to business are already in operation in Canada and elsewhere. Each of these different modes of providing cryptography-based security services raises a variety of considerations not only for business but for lawful access as well. Among the considerations are: the nature of the keys employed (i.e. whether these are one-off session keys for data in transit which are discarded after use or long-term encapsulation keys);  the issue of who controls the cryptographic keys at each phase of the keys' life cycle, beginning with key generation through to key archiving or destruction (i.e. is it the data owner or a trusted agent other than the owner); and  the differences that arise whether one is dealing with the encryption of stored data or the encryption of real-time communications.  Businesses must assess the extent of their information assets, their value to the company, and the firm's information technology capabilities and resources. Given the diverse range of scenarios with which different businesses must cope, there is a vocal demand for freedom of choice in algorithms, selection of standards, and implementation. Trust in the technology and the infrastructure is essential for commercial deployment. In order to facilitate electronic commerce globally, the supporting infrastructure, including procedures and physical components, should be designed to ensure interoperability between users served by certification authorities in different jurisdictions with different national policies. National cryptography policies are designed to establish a level of trust for a country's users and service providers. Interoperability, however, requires some form of matching between each nation's policies. International business organizations consistently ask that national policy implementation in one jurisdiction neither creates an obstacle to interoperability nor reduces the level of trust in the infrastructure of the other jurisdiction. Within national boundaries, there are evidently areas where consensus seems achievable and others where challenges remain. There is, for example, a recognized business need for back-up of the private encryption key. Back-up keys would be used when an employee forgets the password to access their private key, when a technology failure occurs, or in circumstances when the key holder is no longer an employee. The decision to implement key back-up is made by the data owner, i.e., the business rather than the employee. It is important for key back-up mechanisms to be designed in a manner that does not diminish the cryptographic protection available. While there is a business case for the recovery of stored data, there is not an equivalent commercial need for key recovery for encrypted real-time communication (e.g. telephone calls, real-time sessions between two computers on a network, and remote application or database access). In real-time sessions, the parties in communication already have decrypted voice or data at each end. If an encrypted session somehow goes awry, one simply calls again, setting up a new encrypted session. There is no need for key recovery in this instance.   24  Although some companies may need to generate an audit trail of real-time transactions, these functions would logically be introduced before the encryption is applied rather than after. A variety of financial institutions that routinely employ encryption also require extensive audit functions, yet it appears that few of these institutions have implemented these processes in a manner that involves key recovery for data-in-transit. Clearly the aims of law enforcement and business coincide when cryptography protects proprietary information, trade secrets and in general helps defend industry and consumers against fraud and other unlawful activities. In addition, cryptography meets national security objectives to the extent that it helps protect sovereignty, national infrastructures and their valuable information. As an electronic commerce enabler, cryptography increases the competitiveness of businesses and provides opportunities for job creation and industrial growth. Government policies which encourage marketplace innovation and standardization will facilitate the development of cost-effective and user-friendly products and infrastructures and the widespread use of electronic commerce. Regulatory measures risk slowing down the rapid evolution within the information technology products and services market, and creating obstacles to international commerce. Although regulatory control measures have the potential for making it more difficult for criminals to use cryptography, they could also introduce significant costs to the government and private sector required to implement the systems. They might also fail to prevent criminals from circumventing the same measures, for example, through the use of double encryption. The policy challenge is to find solutions that will limit criminal misuse without interfering with legitimate business, institutional or individual interests. Canada has an obvious obligation to protect its citizens from criminal and illegitimate activities. There are both social and competitive economic advantages to having a safe, civil society — a reputation which is enjoyed by Canada. The supply side of the electronic commerce equation must also be carefully considered. Canada has a well-deserved reputation as a world leader in the telecommunications and software sectors and impressive niche strengths in cryptography products. Our industry is well-positioned to increase its market share in a global market expected to grow from US$600 million in 1996 to US$5 billion by 2000.   25  To ensure that these opportunities are not lost, the Canadian cryptography industry is calling for policies that encourage innovation and enable competion on an equal footing internationally. Lawful State Access Considerations   Computer networks have created new opportunities for personal and commercial communications, but not without some adverse impacts on the abilities of law enforcement agencies to protect the public. The new technology has also generated new forms of criminal activity, new methods of committing old crimes, and new ways to conceal evidence. The widespread use of strong cryptography raises concerns in this context, because it can create significant obstacles to the detection and investigation of criminal activities and security threats, as well as the inspection of computer records to monitor compliance with commercial, taxation, environmental and other legal and regulatory requirements. Public safety, crime control, national security and regulatory compliance all require that the agencies involved be rapid and effective in quickly gathering accurate information and evidence about the activities of criminal elements. Agencies that play key roles include the RCMP, provincial and local police forces, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Revenue Canada (Taxation, Customs and Excise), the federal Competition Bureau, as well as federal and provincial environmental enforcement agencies. These agencies are responsible for identifying threats and detecting, investigating and prosecuting matters ranging from terrorism, crimes of violence and property crimes to abuses of domestic and international commercial and financial systems. The effectiveness of these agencies in monitoring criminal activities, and in investigating and prosecuting offenders often depends on their ability to conduct electronic surveillance of communications and to search or inspect places, including computers, where relevant information may be kept. This is done, as required by the Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the  Criminal Code , and other statutes, only with the authorization of a court, based on an assessment of the legal justification for invading the privacy of the suspects and those who communicate with them. The necessity for such surveillance is recognized by the Charter [ss. 1, 8 and 24 (2)], which allows seizures and surveillance that are "reasonable" and "justifiable in a free and democratic society," and allows evidence to be used if its admission does not "bring the administration of justice into disrepute." Historically, as the use of electronic and radio telecommunications and the technical ability to monitor them have evolved, it has been recognized throughout the developed world that there is a legitimate need for agencies of the state to be permitted to monitor communications, provided that adequate legal and judicial safeguards are in place. Similar principles apply to physical searches and inspections, which are now being extended to the search or inspection of computers and networks. In regulating these activities, national constitutions, legislation and court decisions have always balanced the need to protect fundamental privacy interests against equally fundamental interests in public safety and security. The increasing use of strong cryptography will generate some crime-control benefits by providing technical protection for confidential information, such as the information used to conduct financial transactions electronically, but it also represents a significant threat to the ability to conduct lawful and authorized electronic surveillance. While judicial authorizations could still be obtained, those who intercept encrypted information would not be able to read it. This creates two major difficulties: it would become difficult or impossible to determine whether the information being intercepted fell within the scope of the legal authorization to intercept it; and  it would become difficult for the authorities to decipher the information, or to do so in time to use it effectively or take action to prevent harm from occurring.   In many cases, rapid access to information is essential to successful investigations because subsequent steps depend on the information and cannot be taken until it is too late. This is particularly true with respect to computer systems, which can be used to move, conceal or erase large quantities of information at the touch of a button. In some cases, timely access may be necessary in order to permit steps to be taken to prevent a crime or a terrorist act from being committed. The increase in global telecommunications has created new opportunities for domestic and transnational crime and new obstacles to effective controls. Any form of illegal activity which requires the co-ordinated or concerted efforts of many people in different places will be facilitated by the availability of secure telecommunications, and governments have an obligation to respond. Common examples facing Canadian agencies include: protecting Canadians and Canadian sovereignty against terrorism, political or economic destabilisation or similar threats from foreign states or organized groups;  detecting and prosecuting the use of computers and telecommunications for illegal transfer or trafficking in narcotics, weapons and other dangerous or illegal goods;  detecting and prosecuting the use of computers and telecommunications to launder the proceeds of crime; and  detecting and prosecuting the use of computers and telecommunications to transfer information illegally (such as child pornography, hate propaganda, intellectual property and commercial or national secrets).   Offenders can use computers and network technology as a tool to commit old crimes in new ways, such as the distribution of child pornography on the Internet. The availability of easily accessible, secure telecommunications is likely to provide assistance to the business of criminal as well as legitimate enterprises. Examples include the use of computers and telecommunications to move crime proceeds while concealing their origins and the use of such communications by criminal and terrorist groups to organize and co-ordinate their activities. Gaining lawful access to encrypted, stored data is in some cases not as time-sensitive as the interception of ongoing communications, but it represents a more broad-ranging problem. A large number of federal and provincial laws allow for the inspection of routine business records to check for compliance with taxation laws, import-export controls, environmental or health standards, competition or trade regulations, and numerous other matters. These legitimate enforcement and inspection activities may be threatened by the widespread use of strong cryptography, even for legitimate commercial security reasons. The law enforcement, regulatory and security communities clearly recognize the substantial commercial and legitimate privacy advantages which will accrue from the use of encrypted telecommunications for personal and commercial applications. Equally, they recognize that these very advantages bring with them new criminal opportunities and security threats. To effectively discharge their responsibilities to protect Canada and Canadians from these threats, the agencies involved require some means whereby encrypted data can be decrypted and read within a reasonable time and at a reasonable expenditure of resources. This will require striking a policy, legal and technological balance between the interests of personal privacy and the development of efficient commercial communications on one hand, and the protection of society on the other. Human Rights and Civil Liberties Considerations   On the grounds set out above, there are legitimate reasons for providing lawful state access to encrypted information in some circumstances. In practice, options for ensuring that access generally involve either limiting the use of cryptography products to those which can be decrypted and read when necessary or requiring those who have the keys to decrypt messages on demand. The basic policy options and the practical means of implementing them raise human rights concerns, chiefly with respect to privacy and the freedom of expression. Ultimately, cryptography policy options must be assessed on their respective costs and benefits in terms of basic human rights, commercial interests, public security and crime-control. This in turn requires an assessment of what crime-control and security benefits might result from limiting encryption, and how this would compare with the harms that might result from unregulated encryption. To make matters even more challenging, the overall impact of cryptography and the feasibility of regulating it are both largely unknown quantities at this stage. For example, even if some form of lawful state access to plaintext were provided, it is not clear whether the ability of security and law-enforcement agencies to fulfill their responsibilities would be maintained at roughly existing levels. Whether all of this maintains a security and law enforcement capability which is acceptable to Canadians is difficult to establish because any meaningful frame of reference is also changing. The technical ability to conduct various forms of lawful access has been significantly increased by new technologies in recent decades. Systems for data storage, transmission and retrieval make it possible for large quantities of personal information to be stored and retrieved quickly, and searched automatically. This assists law enforcement, but has also created new criminal activities and new ways for those who wish to avoid detection to conceal their activities. The prospect that information will be obtained by those who should not have access to it also greatly increases the concerns about basic privacy rights and the need for effective safeguards as the quantity of information which can be accessed has increased. As in many democratic countries, the rights of Canadians to some degree of privacy and to express themselves freely are constitutionally protected. Section 8 of the Charter guarantees Canadians the right to be free from "unreasonable search or seizure" and paragraph 2(b) guarantees the right of free expression. Privacy rights will likely prohibit the state from decrypting data without some fairly compelling justification, and the right to freedom of expression may extend to both the production of cryptographic products and their use to protect the messages being expressed or data being stored. These guarantees are important, but not absolute. Invasions of privacy, including the seizure of data or interception of communications, must be justified and authorized by the courts. The freedom of expression may protect one's right to create or use cryptography, but could be limited by law, provided that the limits are reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society (s.1). How these provisions would apply to the regulation of cryptography in Canada would depend to a large degree on exactly what requirements are set and how they are applied. They will certainly operate as a constraint on the policies and laws which may be adopted, however, and as a safeguard of individual rights once they are in place. Historically, state intrusions on privacy in the form of search, seizure or electronic surveillance have been based on the justification that there are grounds to believe that the individual whose privacy the state seeks to invade is either involved in some form of wrongdoing, or has some concrete evidence of wrongdoing. These are the criteria applied by the courts in balancing individual privacy against state interests. The same principles would apply to encrypted information, but decrypting information is not identical to either of the existing precedents — seizing evidence with a search warrant or intercepting communications with a judicial authorization. If decryption requires access to the keys, seizing them with a conventional warrant would alert the recipient of the message that he or she was under investigation. Setting up a system in which the keys must be held and accessed by a third party would not alert the sender and recipient that they are targets of surveillance. This system, however, requires the sender and recipient to provide the keys even in cases where there was no surveillance, suspicion or judicial scrutiny based on wrongdoing. In such models, the safeguard of judicial scrutiny would have to be conducted at the time encryption keys were actually used. This would only occur with respect to the small minority of messages and keys where lawful state access was actually sought, and other protections would have to be found for the majority of keys. Internationally, computer networks and other communications media have been combined with encryption to report on human rights abuses and to protect the safety of persons promoting democracy and human rights in oppressive countries. Governments concerned about human rights and democracy should preserve and protect these human rights efforts as much as possible,  26  and should consider the impact their internal and export control policies could have on human rights workers. For example, by controlling the domestic use or export of encryption products that do not have a state access encryption feature, countries would likely discourage companies from producing such technologies. As a result, human rights and democracy workers would likely find it difficult to obtain technologies that cannot be accessed by repressive governments. Technical Security Considerations   The application of the Canadian Charter and legislative requirements imposed by the courts (e.g. on the scope of a warrant) addresses some of the fundamental privacy and freedom of expression issues raised by lawful state access, but does not provide assurance that the creation of mechanisms for giving such access will not inadvertently create gaps in security that might be exploited by illicit interests.  27  From a technical standpoint, strong cryptography products are difficult to "break" short of a "brute force" attack by powerful computers. If commercial products prove deficient in some way, the problem would presumably be identified and corrected quickly by the marketplace. The possibility that access mechanisms built into the systems for legitimate government purposes might be used by illicit interests would not be so easily prevented or corrected. The exact vulnerabilities, if any, would depend on the nature of the access mechanisms. If keys were kept by CAs or TTPs, for example, precautions against theft would be needed. If some alternate form of access was embedded in encryption software, there would be the possibility that someone other than those authorized by the courts might discover how to use it. Proponents of relaxed controls on the use of encryption point out that in Australia (the Walsh report),  28  the United States (the National Research Council report),  29  and Europe (the European Commission),  30  independent studies by experts in cryptography have identified a number of benefits from encryption, but also a variety of problems with proposals to limit choice of encryption products — primarily the technical challenge, effectiveness and cost associated with fully comprehensive key recovery schemes. They have not recommended that governments require key escrow or key recovery features at this time. At the same time, Canadian policy must respect Canada's international committments. International Considerations   Canada is a global trading nation and an active member of numerous international bodies. Other countries are examining their encryption policy options at the same time as we are. Canada will need to closely examine the evolving direction of key exporting nations, as well as trading blocks such as NAFTA, the EU and others, in order to ensure that our industrial and economic interests are not disadvantaged and discourage unnecessary obstacles to global trade and commerce. At present, it is unclear how most countries will come to grips with the issue of export and domestic controls. Some countries have domestic import and use controls in place and others are studying the problems. Some favour export controls as a means of indirectly influencing the types of products available domestically, and others appear reluctant to impose any constraints on the market for encryption. What is clear is that the international context will have a bearing on Canadian policy. Canada is signatory to a number of international treaties and conventions that protect freedom of expression, media and communications, and privacy and human rights generally. Canada is also signatory not only to the Wassenaar Arrangement, but also to a number of international conventions promoting effective law enforcement measures to counter drug trafficking, money laundering and terrorism. Commitments to our allies, the international community and our inter-national obligations are factors that circumscribe our policy options. A national policy stance completely at odds with those of our allies could damage long-standing security relationships. A policy at odds with the positions of other producer nations risks being ineffective. If, for example, controls were applied in Canada but not elsewhere, it would be difficult to prevent non-complying software from being physically or electronically smuggled into the country. Cryptography policy has become an important issue because computer software capable of strong encryption and portable computers powerful enough to run such software have become commonplace. As with any other data, strong encryption software is easily transferred from one place or jurisdiction to another using the Internet, making import and export controls difficult to enforce.  22  Each option implies a different set of technical and operational elements, legal and cost implications, as well as difficult-to-measure dimensions such as public safety, sovereignty, and civil liberties. No option can totally guarantee lawful access, although some may come closer than others.  23  A closed network connects users who already have contractual relationships and mutual trust, e.g., banking customers and employees. A closed system is often enforced through various technical means, such as the parties employing end-to-end encryption on leased lines. By contrast, the most obvious example of an open network is the Internet, a vast interconnected network composed of thousands of networks (each of which have their own forms of administration, creating a complex environment ranging from virtual anarchism through cooperative community services to multiple commercial security policies).  24  One might imagine exceptional circumstances (i.e. suspicion of a rogue employee), in which a company may need to intercept its employees' encrypted communications. If this were the case, however, it would be easier for the company to initiate surveillance before the communication has been encrypted rather than tackling the more difficult problem that arises after encryption.  25  Dataquest.  26  Some of the arguments being marshaled on behalf of human rights have been presented by the American Association for the Advancement of Science at: http://www.aaas.org/spp/dspp/cstc/briefings/crypto/  27  See the 1997 report of leading private sector cryptography experts in the U.S., The Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, and Trusted Third-Party Encryption (http://www.crypto.com/key_study/report.shtml).  28  Walsh, Gerard,  Review of Policy Relating to Encryption Technologies , Report completed October 10, 1996, for Security Division, Attorney General's Department, Government of Australia, and released under Freedom of Information Act, June 1997.
