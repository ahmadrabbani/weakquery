 Israel Matzav: Israeli government to subsidize Chabad abroad

   Israel Matzav         Powered by WebAds    Friday, March 04, 2011  Israeli government to subsidize Chabad abroad     From his perch in Heaven, the Lubavitcher Rebbe of blessed memory must be smiling this morning (and let me add immediately that I am not a follower of Lubavitch and therefore I am saying this as an ordinary simple Jew). The Israeli government has finally recognized the many services Chabad-Lubavitch performs abroad for traveling Israelis and for the Jewish people generally. It is going to   participate in the costs  .  Committee Chairman Danny Danon (Likud) complimented the activities of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. “Every Jew who arrives at any remote point in the world knows that they have a place on holidays and Shabbat. The government already invests today in Jewish education in the Diaspora, and should use this power to take responsibility for places where travelers are concentrated on the holidays,” he said. Danon called on Religious Services Minister Ya’acov Margi (Shas) to prepare a proposal for a cabinet decision to determine criteria to provide financial support for Chabad institutions to cover security and education- related expenses. Rabbi Berel Lazar, the chief rabbi of Russia and a Chabad rabbi, told the Knesset committee that most Israelis are exposed to Chabad Houses during emergency situations and tragedies, but that even in routine situations, they are an address for Israelis seeking lodging, food, a telephone call to home or just rest. “The existence of the Jewish people in the Diaspora is part of Jewish existence in Israel, and thus there should not be any problem with utilizing Israeli budgets,” he said, adding that money should be allocated not just to Chabad Houses but to other Jewish institutions. Lazar added that recently, when the embassy was closed in one of the Caucasian states out of concern that it could be targeted for attacks marking the anniversary of the death of Hezbollah terrorist leader Imad Mourghniya, the embassy’s security officer recommended that the local Jewish school be closed. Lazar said that he was concerned that when the school was reopened, the local Jews would be hesitant to send their children – and so instead of closing the school, the institution remained open with increased security arrangements. I don't know about the rest of you, but I think this is great.

Carl - would a non-Zionist Jewish group really accept financial assistance from the Israeli government? This is going to have a lot of tongues wagging in the Haredi world!         At  1:09 PM ,      Shy Guy said...

If Chabad needs more money, let them run another telethon. When I make use of a Chabad House anywhere, I leave a donation that covers more than was invested with me. I can think of 100s of public organizations who will now shout "me, too" in demanding equivalent treatment from the Israeli government. Carl, if you want to pay more taxes, do so voluntarily, not at everybody else's expense!         At  7:12 PM ,      Religion and State in Israel said...  The article clearly states that: "Danon  called on Religious Services Minister Ya’acov Margi (Shas)  to prepare a proposal for a cabinet decision  to determine criteria to provide financial support for Chabad institutions to cover security and education- related expenses." [emphasis, mine] However, you state that "(Israel)  is going to participate in the costs." Not sure if I understand how you arrived at this conclusion.
