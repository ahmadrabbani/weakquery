Under the 1952 Citizenship Law, naturalized immigrants currently declare:  "� I will be a loyal national of the State of Israel."  A similar declaration is not required of those seeking citizenship under Israel's Law of Return.  The amendment approved by the Cabinet adds the words:  "�as a Jewish and democratic state, and I promise to honor the laws of the state."  Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director, issued the following statement:  In the spirit of Israel's founding principles of equality, we urge Israel's government to adopt further modifications to the proposed amendment to the citizenship law so it will apply to all immigrants to Israel, including those entering under the law of return.  Many countries around the world, including the United States, require new citizens to take such oaths of allegiance to their new country.  If Israel revises its current law, it is appropriate that it apply to everyone seeking to become a citizen of Israel.   Like what you read here?
