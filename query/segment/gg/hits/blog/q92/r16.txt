This photo, which was given to Israel by Hezbollah in 2008, is believed to have been taken in the 1980s.    The case of Israeli soldier Ron Arad, who has been missing for 23 years, has long been the focus of international attention. Now an Israeli journalist claims to have obtained the truth about Arad's fate.         The baby is wearing a light-colored romper suit. She is sitting on her father's shoulders, her tiny fingers gripping her father's black hair tightly. Her large, dark eyes look directly into the camera.  The photo is 24 years old. Today Yuval is a young woman with long brown hair. "I still can't bear to look at this picture," she says. Shortly after it was taken, her father, an Israeli army navigator, and his pilot were forced to abandon their stricken Phantom jet fighter over Lebanese territory on Oct. 16, 1986. The pilot was rescued, but the navigator has been missing every since. His name is Ron Arad.  The Arad case is one of the greatest mysteries in the  Middle East. His fate has been considered not only by numerous Israeli governments, but also by the United Nations General Assembly. The German foreign intelligence agency, the BND, has been trying to solve the case for more than 15 years. An agent from Berlin has been plowing though old documents, questioning eye witnesses and traveling around the region on behalf of the UN to try to shed light on the case. The mystery now appears to have been solved. A new book by Ronen Bergman, the Israeli daily newspaper  Yediot Ahronot 's intelligence expert, claims Arad has been dead since the mid-1990s. According to the book, this was the conclusion reached by a special military commission in 2005, but the then-prime minister, Ariel Sharon, refused to publish the results. So too did his successors, Ehud Olmert and Benjamin Netanyahu. "The military censors only released the findings of the Arad case because I threatened to file a complaint with the supreme court," Bergman says.  International Dimension  The documents show that Arad initially fell into the hands of the Amal movement, a Lebanese Shiite militia based in Beirut. They openly demanded ransom money, weapons and a prisoner exchange. Arad was then abducted by the group's head of security, Mustafa Dirani, and taken to Lebanon's Bekaa Valley where he was kept in hiding. Dirani subsequently left Amal and joined Hezbollah, taking his prisoner with him. A video from around late 1987 shows Arad was still alive at that time.  In early 1988, Arad was hidden in the small village of Nabi Shith in the Bekaa Valley, where he was guarded by the Shukur clan. But his captors fled when the Israeli air force bombed the region in the early hours of May 5. Arad was left behind, hidden in bushes. When the Shukur clan returned the next morning, their prisoner was gone.  Mustafa Dirani, who was captured by Israeli commandos in southern Lebanon in 1994, told his interrogators he had then contacted a leader of Iran's Revolutionary Guards. He suspects the militias had picked Arad up and taken him to the Iranian capital Tehran. Hezbollah in Beirut also assume this is what happened.  In the mid-1990s, the Arad affair took on an international political dimension. Whoever solved the mystery would be guaranteed to earn kudos. Even communist East Germany took an interest in the case when it was consulted following Israel's arrest of two suspected KGB spies in Tel Aviv. The case was assigned to Wolfgang Vogel, East Berlin's top negotiator. The Stasi, East Germany's notorious secret police, also got involved, and asked the KGB to investigate the possibility of a prisoner exchange involving Arad. Secret Talks  On May 28, 1989, Vogel and his wife traveled to Tel Aviv as the official guests of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. He even signed an agreement on East Germany's behalf together with a lawyer negotiating for the Israeli government. The document stated that Arad would be exchanged for one of the alleged KGB spies. The Israelis were apparently willing to talk about further prisoners, but Vogel was reluctant to do so. "Only the release of Ron Arad can be considered and negotiated at the present time," the agreement said. Vogel talked enthusiastically about his influential contacts. But then, just half a year later, the Berlin Wall fell, putting an end to the East German regime. Reunified Germany continued to look into the case. Bernd Schmidbauer, at the time a senior official in the Chancellery, negotiated with Iranian Ambassador Hossein Mousavian, who gave the impression he could secure Arad's release. However talks broke down in 1995 when it became clear a German court would be handing down a life sentence to an Iranian intelligence agent accused of involvement in the assassination of three exiled Iranian politicians in the  Mykonos restaurant in Berlin three years earlier.  The German government supported the search for Arad on several levels. Because part of the Shukur family had moved to Berlin, the Israelis urged the BND to question the Lebanese about Arad's fate. Israeli agents later picked up one of the Lebanese while he was on vacation abroad and made him take a lie-detector test. However they failed to obtain any concrete information.   1 |  2  Next    Part 1: Secret Israeli Report Reveals Truth about Ron Arad's Fate  Part 2: Shedding Light on the Mystery    Article...
