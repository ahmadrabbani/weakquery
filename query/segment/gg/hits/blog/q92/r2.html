          How Does It Work?</h2>
        <hr>
        <div align="justify">In the State of <a href="/jsource/israel.html">Israel</a>, 
          which was <a href="/jsource/History/dectoc.html">founded</a> on May 
          14, 1948, as in other democratic states, the democratic rule is rooted 
          in the following principles and institutions: <A HREF="http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Politics/basictoc.html">basic 
          laws</A> that lay down the order of government and of the citizens' 
          rights; the holding of elections to the house of representatives and 
          to municipal councils every few years, following which, a central government 
          and local authorities are set up, based on the principle of the rule 
          of the majority, with the rights of the minority guaranteed by law; 
          the principle of the separation between the legislative branch, the 
          executive branch, and the judiciary, to which the institution of state 
          control has been added; freedom of the press. </div>
        <h3 align="left"><font color="maroon">The Electoral System</font></h3>
        <P align="justify"> The elections in Israel are general, equal and secret. 
          On the national level they are held at least once every four years, 
          and on the municipal level at least once every five years. Israel has 
          a system of proportional representation, and the whole state is considered 
          a single constituency. Every party running for election presents a list 
          of candidates, and the number of candidates entering the house of representatives 
          is proportional to the percentage of support the list receives. Every 
          citizen over the age of 18, whose name appears in the list of voters, 
          may vote. </P>
        <h3 align="left"><font color="maroon">The Legislative Branch: The Knesset</font></h3>
        <P align="justify"> The <a href="/jsource/Politics/mktoc.html">Knesset</a> 
          is the house of representatives of the State of Israel. <A HREF="http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Politics/Basic_Law_Knesset.html">The 
          Basic Law: The Knesset</A>, states that the seat of the Knesset is Jerusalem, 
          and that upon election it will have 120 members. The law deals with 
          the elections to the Knesset and with the essence of the service, the 
          work and the immunity of the Knesset, its committees and its members. 
          The law does not define the authority of the Knesset and details regarding 
          the way its functions appear in its regulations. </P>
        <P align="justify"> A new Knesset starts to function after general elections 
          are held, which determine its make&shy;up. The President of the State 
          opens the first session of a new Knesset and immediately passes its 
          running onto the eldest Knesset member. At this meeting the Knesset 
          members declare their allegiance, and the Speaker of the Knesset and 
          his deputies are elected. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The Knesset fulfills its functions by means of two 
          arms: the plenary in which all the Knesset members sit, and the Knesset 
          committees. The plenary holds debates within the framework of legislation, 
          government statements, motions for the agenda, motions of no&shy;confidence 
          and questions, and the deliberations usually end with a vote. </P>
        <P align="justify"> Before a bill reaches the plenary for debate, it must 
          go through a fixed process of preparation. A bill may be presented by 
          an individual Knesset member, a group of Knesset members, the Government 
          as a whole or a single Minister. </P>
        <P align="justify"> When a Ministry initiates a bill, a memorandum on 
          the proposed law is passed on first of all to the Ministry of Justice 
          so that its legal aspects may be examined, to the Ministry of Finance 
          for examination of its economic and budgetary aspects, and to the rest 
          of the Government Ministries for their comments. If the memorandum is 
          approved, the bill is passed on for formulation toward its being presented 
          to the Knesset, and which this draft is approved by the Government, 
          it is presented to the Knesset for first reading. Private members' bills, 
          which do not require Government approval, are presented to the Knesset 
          for preliminary reading, after which each law must pass three readings 
          in the plenary.</P>
        <P align="justify"> In first reading the bill is presented to the plenary 
          and a short debate takes place on its content. After that it is passed 
          on to the appropriate Knesset committee for detailed discussion and 
          redrafting, should this be necessary. After the committee has completed 
          its work, the bill is returned to the plenary, and committee members 
          who have reservations present them. At the end of the debate on the 
          bill in second reading, a vote takes place on each article in it, and 
          unless it is found necessary to return it again to the committee, the 
          third reading takes place and a vote is taken on the bill as a whole.</P>
        <P align="justify"> A bill which has passed third reading is signed by 
          the presiding Speaker, and is later published in the Official Gazette, 
          with the signature of the President of the State, the Prime Minister, 
          the Knesset Speaker and the Minister responsible for the law's implementation. 
          Finally the State seal is placed on it by the Minister of Justice.</P>
        <P align="justify"> Knesset members are entitled to present to the Knesset 
          Speaker motions for the agenda that deal with issues on the national 
          agenda. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The content of a motion, which is approved by the 
          Knesset Presidium, is passed on to the Minister responsible for the 
          issue being raised, so that he can prepare a response. In the debate 
          the proposer of the motion explains his motion, and after it is debated 
          a decision is taken, on the basis of a vote in the plenary, whether 
          to hold a more extensive debate on the issue in the plenary, to pass 
          it on for debate in a committee which will then lay on the Knesset table 
          its proposals, or to reject the motion. A motion for the agenda may 
          also be raised as an urgent motion, which comes up for immediate debate, 
          should the Knesset Presidium be willing to accept the urgency of the 
          matter raised. </P>
        <P align="justify"> A motion of no&shy;confidence in the Government is 
          also a sort of motion for the agenda. Such a motion can only be presented 
          by parties which are not represented in the Government, and their intention, 
          in addition to protesting against the Government policy, is to try and 
          bring it down by means of a vote. So far, a Government has been brought 
          down in Israel only once by a vote of no&shy;confidence-on March 15, 
          1990. </P>
        <P align="justify"> Parliamentary questions are questions directed by 
          a Knesset Member to the appropriate Minister, regarding an action which 
          was taken, or should have been taken and was not. Questions are one 
          of the means at the disposal of the Knesset members to criticize and 
          supervise the activities of the Government. The Minister answers the 
          question in writing or orally.</P>
        <P align="justify"> The Knesset plenary decides on most issues on its 
          agenda by means of a vote, and resolutions are adopted by a majority. 
          A majority usually means the majority of those present at the meeting. 
          There are, however, resolutions which require an absolute majority, 
          and others which require a special majority. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The function of the committees, in addition to dealing 
          with bills, is to supervise the work of the Government Ministries and 
          to hold debates on issues within the realms for which they are responsible, 
          and which are of public interest. By means of the committees, the Knesset 
          maintains direct contact with the Government Ministries, and receives 
          information from Ministers or their representatives. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The Knesset has 12 standing committees:<BR>

        <P align="justify"> Even though it was stated in the Proclamation of Independence-read 
          by David Ben&shy;Gurion at the ceremony in which the State of Israel 
          was declared-that the Constituent Assembly, which turned into the First 
          Knesset, would draft a constitution for Israel, this was not done due 
          to differences of opinion with the religious parties. In place of a 
          constitution, it was decided to legislate a series of basic laws, which 
          in the future would together form the constitution. This task is now--46 
          years after the establishment of the State--close to completion, and 
          there are several articles in the existing <A HREF="http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Politics/basictoc.html">basic 
          laws</A> which can only be amended by an absolute majority (the support 
          of more than 60 MKs) or a special majority (which is large than an absolute 
          majority) of the Knesset members. The existing basic laws are:<BR>

        <P align="justify"> Until after the elections to the 13th Knesset, it 
          was the President who assigned the task of forming a new Government 
          to the head of the list with the best chances of succeeding, who was 
          also usually the head of the largest party in the Knesset. The Government 
          required the approval of the Knesset, so that it needed to represent 
          a coalition supported by a majority of the Knesset members, even if 
          not all of its supporters were actual members in it. </P>
        <P align="justify"> According to the amendment to the <A HREF="/jsource/Politics/Basic_Law_Government.html">Basic 
          Law: The Government</A>, which was adopted toward the end of the 12th 
          Knesset, as of the elections to the 14th Knesset, simultaneous elections 
          will take place for the Knesset and a directly elected Prime Minister. 
          As in the past, the new Prime Minister will have to present the Ministers 
          in his Government to the Knesset, as well as the distribution of portfolios 
          amongst them, and obtain its confidence. At the time of presenting his 
          Government, the new Prime Minister will announce its basic guidelines, 
          which will constitute the new Government's work plan. After the Knesset 
          will express its confidence in the new Government, the Prime Minister 
          and his Ministers will declare their allegiance before the Knesset. 
          During its service, all the members of the Government will be collectively 
          responsible for the activities of all the Minsters, and for the Government 
          as a whole. </P>
        <P align="justify"> Most of the Ministers are responsible for one or more 
          Government Ministries, but can also serve as a Minister without Portfolio. 
          Ministers do not have to be Knesset members, while Deputy Ministers-and 
          there can be more than one Deputy Minister in each Ministry-must be 
          members. The addition of new Ministers to the Government in the course 
          of its term of office, or a change in the distribution of functions 
          among them, requires the Knesset's approval. </P>
        <P align="justify"> It is the Government which determines its own working 
          arrangements and the manner in which it adopts decisions. It usually 
          meets for one weekly meeting on Sundays, though in urgent cases additional 
          meetings may be called. The Government may also act by means of standing 
          or occasional Ministerial Committees, some of whose decisions require 
          the approval of the Government as a whole. </P>
        <P align="justify"> A Government which has resigned or has been brought 
          down by a vote of no&shy;confidence, continues to serve until a new 
          Government is formed, and is then called a transitional Government. 
        </P>
        <P align="justify"> The number of Ministries maintained by the Government 
          varies from time to time according to the needs and to coalition constraints. 
          The 26th Government of the State of Israel, which was formed in July 
          1996, is made up of the following Ministries: </P>

        <h3 align="left"><font color="maroon">Local Government</font></h3>
        <P align="justify"><U>Structure of Local Government</U></P>
        <P align="justify"> The law defines three types of local authorities: 
          municipalities, local councils and regional councils. Municipalities 
          administer urban towns, generally with a population of more than 20,000. 
          In 1995, the number of such municipalities totaled 51. The three largest 
          cities are Jerusalem, the capital (population 579,000), Tel Aviv (population 
          355,000) and Haifa (population 247,000). There are nine medium&shy;sized 
          municipalities of 110,000 to 160,000 residents, while most municipalities 
          have a population of about 20,000 to 80,000. </P>
        <P align="justify"> Smaller urban towns and large rural settlements are 
          governed by local councils, with powers similar to those of a municipality. 
          More than 70 out of 150 local councils serve a population of more than 
          5,000. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The regional councils are in fact two&shy;tier local 
          authorities. The lower tier is the settlements, which are mostly agricultural; 
          they are authorized to elect a local committee for providing municipal 
          services. The upper tier is the regional council, which includes candidates 
          from each settlement in the council's jurisdiction. It possesses the 
          powers of a local council. </P>
        <P align="justify"> Municipal federations of adjacent local authorities 
          are a single&shy;purpose local authority, providing certain services 
          such as firefighting, working together mainly because of economies of 
          scale. The federation has a separate budgetary framework and may sign 
          contracts, legislate bylaws, levy taxes and so forth. </P>
        <P align="justify"><U>Functions</U></P>
        <P align="justify"> The local authority provides its residents, commercial 
          firms, and other institutions within its area of jurisdiction with a 
          wide range of services. It develops its physical infrastructure, road 
          system, water supply, refuse collection and disposal system, sewage 
          system, and parks. It is responsible for environmental protection (public 
          health, nuisances, cleanliness, etc.) and, with the Ministry of Education, 
          Culture and Sport, the education system. The local authority builds 
          schools and provides for their equipment and maintenance. Pre&shy;kindergartens 
          and secondary education institutions are established and administered 
          by the local authority, but some of these facilities may be owned by 
          nonprofit organizations with aid given by the local authority. Local 
          authorities also promote and financially assist cultural and sports 
          activities (libraries, museums, youth clubs, etc.) and some maintain 
          orchestras, choirs, theaters and similar enterprises. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The local authority provides social welfare services, 
          with its social workers taking care of families in need, as well as 
          special groups such as the elderly, retarded children, drug addicts 
          and the like. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The local council has an important role in town planning. 
          The Planning and Building Law, 5725&shy;1965, sets forth the principles 
          according to which town planning is undertaken, as well as planning 
          institutions that must act at the local, district, and countrywide geographic 
          and administrative levels. The law grants the local planning commission 
          considerable independence, while also expanding the regional and countrywide 
          dimensions in planning. The local planning commission consists of members 
          of the local council. The law gives the local planning commission responsibility 
          for day&shy;to&shy;day management and on&shy;site compliance with regulations. 
        </P>
        <P align="justify"> The district planning commission is a joint state&shy;local 
          authority comprising representatives of those government ministries 
          whose field of action is relevant to the issues of planning, and of 
          representatives of the local authorities in the region. The district 
          commission approves detailed local plans and also acts as a forum for 
          handling appeals of decisions made by local commissions. The local council 
          is authorized to issue bylaws in every area in which it has jurisdiction. 
          It has the power to enforce those bylaws as well as the laws and regulations 
          applicable to its functions. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The local authorities are empowered to levy local 
          taxes and imposts and collect various payments for services and concessions. 
          In general, they have the powers and means to manage their finances. 
          They prepare their own budgets, which then must be approved by the Ministry 
          of the Interior. Each municipality must employ an auditor to check its 
          activities. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The Union of Local Authorities is a voluntary organization 
          of municipalities and local councils. The regional councils are organized 
          separately in the Organization of Regional Councils, since they have 
          special problems which differ from other local authorities. Both organizations 
          have a central goal, to further the mutual interests of the local authorities 
          in their relations with government ministries and the Knesset (parliament). 
          The Union represents the local authorities in negotiations for collective 
          wage agreements and it signs such agreements together with the Histadrut 
          (New General Federation of Labor) and the government. It also hosts 
          various associations of key local officials such as the Association 
          of Town Clerks and the Association of Local Treasurers. </P>
        <P align="justify"><U>Legal Status</U></P>
        <P align="justify"> The Municipal Corporations Ordinance dates from 1934 
          when Great Britain held the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine. 
          This law essentially established the legal basis for the present system 
          of local government in Israel. The State of Israel enacted the Municipal 
          Corporations Ordinance (new version) 5724&shy;1964, which serves, along 
          with other legal frameworks, as the basis for local government structure 
          and its relations with government ministries. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The local authorities are legal entities and are able 
          to perform a wide range of services in the physical, educational&shy;cultural 
          and social welfare arenas. Their competencies and areas of jurisdiction 
          are spelled out by ministerial orders (mainly from the Ministry of the 
          Interior), as authorized by law. As a legal entity, the local authority 
          can only do what the law permits it to do. Consequently, there are detailed 
          laws regulating the activities of the local authority. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The general powers of the local authorities are in 
          six basic areas: legislation; taxation; financial management; joint 
          activities with other bodies; and various general powers. While not 
          completely independent in any of these areas, a local authority is able 
          to act on behalf of local interests within each of them according to 
          the wishes of the elected representatives of the local constituency. 
        </P>
        <P align="justify"><U>Income Sources</U></P>
        <P align="justify"> The income in the ordinary budget of local authorities 
          comes from three sources: locally&shy;generated income, government participation 
          and loans for balancing the ordinary budget. From the early 1970s to 
          the mid&shy;1980s, locally&shy;generated income was low and government 
          participation was high; from then on the proportions were reversed. 
        </P>
        <P align="justify"> Government financial participation includes two categories: 
          the general grant and earmarked participation. The general grant is 
          provided to the local authorities without being tied to any specific 
          expenditure, since it is meant to be a supplement to local taxes for 
          those authorities with a low collection potential. </P>
        <P align="justify"> Most of the earmarked income originates in the Ministry 
          of Education, Culture and Sport and the Ministry of Labor and Social 
          Welfare. The former covers the salaries of some educational personnel, 
          as well as full or partial coverage of other projects operated by the 
          local authority. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare finances 75 
          percent or more of local authority welfare activities according to standards 
          set by the Ministry. As most local authorities exceed these standards, 
          actual government participation amounts to 60&shy;66 percent of local 
          welfare expenditures. </P>
        <P align="justify"> Government ministries provide grants and loans to 
          finance development projects such as educational and cultural facilities, 
          roads, water and sewage systems, as well as general development grants 
          for projects selected by local preference. Occasionally loans have been 
          granted to balance the authorities' regular budgets and reduce deficits. 
        </P>
        <P align="justify"> The State Commission on Local Government, which was 
          appointed by a decision of the central government, presented its final 
          report in 1981. Its main recommendations related to new financial relations 
          with the central government and to the minimizing of central supervision 
          over local authorities. Thus, in the 1980s and 1990s, some additional 
          functions and responsibilities were given to local government in physical, 
          social and educational arenas. Studies show that local authorities generally 
          succeed in fulfilling their duties and in completing projects which 
          they initiate, even though many approvals are involved in the process. 
          The influence of the local authority is relatively wide in many areas, 
          even when the central government controls the purse strings or other 
          factors. </P>
        <P align="justify"><U>Relations with Government Ministries</U></P>
        <P align="justify"> State services, principally in the areas of education 
          and welfare, comprise more than half the local budget and an even higher 
          proportion of the personnel employed by local authorities. They constitute 
          the major arena of interaction between local and state authorities. 
        </P>
        <P align="justify"> For the most part, the Ministry of Education is responsible 
          for the curriculum and the professional qualifications of teachers, 
          while the local authority is responsible for the provision and maintenance 
          of school buildings and physical equipment. Employees in the elementary 
          and intermediate schools are employees of the Ministry of Education, 
          while maintenance personnel, school secretaries, assistant kindergarten 
          teachers and secondary school teachers are employed by the local authority. 
        </P>
        <P align="justify"> Formally, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare 
          is the authority which sets policy regarding welfare services and the 
          local authority acts as the agent to execute that policy. However, the 
          professional staff (the social workers) and services are managed by 
          the local welfare bureau. Over the years, the local authorities have 
          developed projects and services beyond the formal requirements set by 
          the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The Ministry of the Interior supervises the activities 
          of the local authorities and is primarily responsible in the following 
          areas: the establishment of local authorities, approval of their budgets, 
          provision of a suitable legal framework to fit their needs, examination 
          of their bylaws, and assurance that physical planning and development 
          projects conform to national and regional outline schemes. The Ministry 
          distributes grants based upon specific criteria to local authorities 
          with low potential income, to enable them to meet minimal service standards. 
          The Ministry of the Interior also represents the local authorities in 
          negotiations with the government (namely, the Finance Ministry). </P>
        <P align="justify"><U>Local Elections</U></P>
        <P align="justify"> The local authorities are headed by councils whose 
          members are elected every five years on the basis of the proportional 
          representation of their political parties. The number of seats in the 
          councils is determined by the size of their population; between 9 and 
          31 seats for municipalities and between 5 and 21 for local councils. 
          Mayors (including the chairpersons of local and regional councils) are 
          elected directly by the voters. In many cases no single party controls 
          the majority of seats on the councils and the mayor has to form a coalition 
          to achieve a working majority. Agreements are made among the parties 
          for this purpose, involving the distribution of powers and functions 
          among the coalition partners. </P>
        <P align="justify"> When elections for the Knesset and the local authorities 
          have been held at the same time, voter turnout in the local elections 
          was between 73 and 83 percent, while in the case of separate election 
          dates, turnout has averaged around 60 percent. Voter turnout for local 
          elections in the Arab sector has traditionally been much higher than 
          that in the Jewish sector. </P>
        <P align="justify"> According to the local election financing law, each 
          party list in the local authority is entitled to receive financing based 
          on the number of council seats it wins. The State Comptroller's positive 
          report on the financial management of the election campaign for each 
          faction represented on the council entitles the faction to receive its 
          allocation as determined by the formula. </P>
        <h3 align="left"><font color="maroon">The Judiciary</font></h3>
        <P align="justify"> The <a href="/jsource/Politics/judtoc.html">courts</a> 
          deal with cases of persons charged with a breach of the law. Charges 
          are brought up by citizens against other citizens, by the state against 
          citizens, and even by citizens against the state. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The sessions of the courts of law are usually public, 
          unless it is decided to hold closed hearings under special circumstances. 
          When more than one judge is presiding, and the judges do not agree on 
          a verdict, the opinion of the majority is decisive. Israel does not 
          have trials by jury. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The cases brought to the courts are of two types: 
          criminal cases and civil cases. A criminal case is one involving a transgression 
          of the social order, and its intention is to punish the offender, if 
          his guilt has been proven. In a civil case the plaintiff is a private 
          person or association and the defendant is a private person or association. 
          The subject of the trial is the demand that a contract signed between 
          the parties be fulfilled, a debt is returned or compensation is paid 
          for damages caused. In a civil trial there is no punishment, but a duty 
          to pay financial or other compensation. </P>
        <P align="justify"> There are three instances in the regular courts: magistrate 
          courts, which have the authority to try light and intermediate offences, 
          or civil cases in which the sum claimed is no higher than a million 
          shekels (approximately U.S. $300,000); district courts, which try serious 
          offenses, and civil cases in which the sum claimed is more than a million 
          shekels (approximately U.S. $300,000); and the Supreme Court, which 
          sits in Jerusalem. The number of judges serving on the Supreme Court 
          is determined by the Knesset. The judges elect a permanent President 
          of the Supreme Court and a deputy from amongst themselves. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The <a href="/jsource/Politics/judiciary.html#hcj">Supreme 
          Court</a> is involved in two realms: The first is to hear appeals for 
          verdicts given by district courts. In this capacity it is called the 
          Supreme Court of Appeals. The verdict of the Supreme Court of Appeals 
          is final. The second is to hear appeals by persons who feel that they 
          have been wronged by one of the State authorities or statutory bodies. 
          In this capacity the court is called the High Court of Justice. The 
          High Court of Justice functions by means of orders. </P>
        <P align="justify"> In addition to the ordinary courts there are special 
          courts, which are authorized to deal with specific matters only. The 
          most important amongst these are the military courts, the labor courts, 
          and the religious courts. There are religious courts of the four main 
          religious denominations: Jewish, Muslim, Christian and <a href="/jsource/Society_&_Culture/druze.html">Druze</a>. 
          Each religious court can only try cases applying to members of its own 
          religious community who are citizens of the State or permanent residents. 
          Since matters of personal status in Israel are usually decided on the 
          basis of religious laws, the religious courts deal with them. </P>
        <h3 align="left"><font color="maroon">State Control</font></h3>
        <P align="justify"> The function of the State control is to supervise 
          the ministries and other government institutions, the security forces, 
          the local authorities, and any other body which is financed by the state 
          and is subject to control under the law, a decision by the Knesset or 
          agreement with the Government. The State Comptroller is appointed by 
          the President of the State, on the basis of the recommendation of the 
          Knesset House Committee. The Comptroller is elected by the Knesset for 
          a period of five years, and their status is not dependent on the executive 
          branch. </P>
        <P align="justify"> In the process of control, the Comptroller examines 
          the legality of activities performed by the supervised bodies on matters 
          of money or property, and on their frugality, efficiency and integrity. 
          The supervised bodies must provide the Comptroller with all the information 
          about their activities and with documents as demanded by him or her. 
        </P>
        <P align="justify"> The faults found in the course of the inspection are 
          brought by the Comptroller to the attention of those supervised, and 
          they are required to put them right. Once a year the State Comptroller 
          prepares a report on his or her activities. The State Comptroller's 
          report is prepared for the Knesset, where it is discussed in the Knesset 
          State Control Committee, and is then brought to the Knesset plenary 
          for the approval of the Committee's conclusions and proposals. The report 
          is published and brought to the public's attention. </P>
        <P align="justify"> The State Comptroller also serves as a Public Ombudsman, 
          to whom private persons who have been personally hurt by one of the 
          State authorities, can complain in writing or orally. The treatment 
          of such complaints, as well as publication of the activities of the 
          Public Ombudsman, are similar to that of the State Comptroller's report. 
        </P>
        <h3 align="left"><font color="maroon">Freedom of the Press</font></h3>
        <P align="justify"> The institutions of government in Israel are subject 
          to public scrutiny by the written and electronic media. Public scrutiny 
          is one of the marks and foundations of a democracy, and in Israel it 
          is secured in the principle of freedom of expression which is mentioned 
          in the <A HREF="/jsource/History/Dec_of_Indep.html">Declaration of Independence</A>, 
          and is currently being secured in a basic law. </P>
        <P align="justify"> Since the establishment of the State, the written 
          press has not been government owned, but until recently the electronic 
          media was fully controlled by the Government. Today there are private 
          radio and television networks side by side with the national ones. </P>
