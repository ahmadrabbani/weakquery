Mr Peres, who has the sole right of pardon under the constitution, is expected to grant freedom to a total of 1,027 Palestinians in Israeli custody. Although Israel has a history of agreeing to major prisoner swaps in exchange for its captured citizens – or even their corpses – never before have so many been freed for the return of one man.   That fact alone has prompted disgruntlement in some quarters on the Israeli right. But discontent turned to fury after the government admitted that 280 of those to be released had been jailed for life on murder charges.   The identity of those to be released will not be made public until Saturday evening. But there were widespread claims among opponents of the deal that the 280 prisoners serving life terms were responsible for killing than 500 Israeli deaths during a terror campaign mounted by Palestinian militants during the Intifada, or uprising, that began in 2000.   The recriminations spread into the cabinet of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, who faced warnings that he had only emboldened Hamas by giving so much for so little.

"It's a big victory for Hamas," he added.  As one of just three ministers in the 29-man Israeli cabinet to vote against the deal, Mr Landau's views were hardly representative of the public mood. Mr Netanyahu's agreement with Hamas was widely hailed, with an overwhelming majority of Israelis deeply relieved that the young conscript spirited into Gaza by tunnel in June, 2006 after his abduction during a routine patrol is finally coming home.  There has also been huge public sympathy for Sgt Shalit's parents, Noam and Aviva, who ended an 18-month tented vigil outside Mr Netanyahu's office in emotional scenes yesterday, dismantling their makeshift protest camp to prepare to welcome their son home.  "This is a symbolic day of happiness blended with sorrow," Noam Shalit said. "The government succeeded after five years and 1,935 long nights in bringing Gilad home."  Even now, after so many of moments of disappointment when promised breakthroughs collapsed in the past, their joy was tempered by uncertainty. Mr Shalit said he would rejoice when he actually saw his son descend the steps leading to the family home in northern Israel.  The young conscript, who is now 25, is expected to be flown to Cairo as early as next Tuesday by when the opportunity for legal challenges in Israel to the prisoner swap will have been exhausted.  Responding to criticism from the right, Yoram Cohen, the head of Israel's domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet was forced to admit that some of those released could again seek to unleash a campaign of violence against his countrymen.  "We cannot promise that they will not produce terror," he said. "Statistics show that 60 per cent of those released in prisoner swaps return to activity in terrorist organisations."  But he insisted that Israel would be able to deal with the threat, arguing that Hamas was not interested in escalating violence with the Jewish state.  Yet there was little doubt that the prisoner swap represents both a major political boost for Hamas and a potential setback for hopes of a negotiated settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority and leader of the secular Fatah party, has for years tried to convince Israel through peaceful methods to release Palestinian prisoners – to no avail. His attempts to win UN backing for the creation of a Palestinian state have also been rebuffed and many ordinary Palestinians could not be swayed by Hamas's argument that violent resistance is the only way to force Israel into making concessions.  The movement used its triumph yesterday to taunt its rivals in Fatah.  "We hope Abbas would learn his lesson and abandon illusions that will not achieve a state and will not establish a state" said Mustafa al-Sawaf, a senior Hamas official. "He should reconsider his position and return to the side of the Palestinian people.  "Resistance got what it wanted and Hamas fulfilled the promise it made."  Ironically, however, the deal is only thought to have been achieved because Hamas was forced to drop a number of its key demands, among them the release of some of the best known Palestinian militants in Israeli prisons.  The movement has been facing an uncertain future with the Syrian government, one of its key patrons, fighting for its survival after the eruption of a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March.  It has also been considerably weakened as Palestinians turned against its violent ethos to support Mr Abbas's statehood bid. But with its position now restored, Mr Abbas will be under pressure to stand firm against Israeli demands to return to negotiations and will also be aware that any failure to achieve statehood could prove fatally crippling.  However, the deal is likely to alleviate an acrimonious feud that has badly damaged Israel's relations with Egypt and Turkey, two previously friendly states vital to its security. Both states played vital roles in mediating Mr Shalit's release and Israel yesterday sought to return the favour by formally apologising for the deaths of five Egyptian policemen killed by Israeli troops in a cross-border raid in August – a step Mr Netanyahu had previously refused to countenance.
