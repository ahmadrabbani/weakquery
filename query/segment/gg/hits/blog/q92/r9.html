   The following are excerpts from the 'Peace &amp; Security' chapter of
   the Likud Party platform. The other chapters are currently being
   translated. 

   <h3>The Foundations of Peace</h3>

   Peace is a primary objective of the State of Israel. The Likud will
   strengthen the existing peace agreements with the Arab states and
   strive to achieve peace agreements with all of Israel's neighbors
   with the aim of reaching a comprehensive solution to the
   Arab-Israeli conflict. 
<p>
   The Likud will seek to achieve peace and permanent borders in the
   framework of peace treaties between Israel and its neighbors and
   will seek cooperation with them on the practical level. The peace
   agreements will include full diplomatic relations, borders open to
   free movement, economic cooperation, and the establishment of
   joint projects in the fields of science, technology, tourism, and
   industry. 
<p>
   The Arab states' desire for peace will be measured by their efforts to
   prevent hostile activities by terrorist organizations from their territory
   and to dismantle the infrastructure of the organizations. This
   includes closing their headquarters and preventing economic and
   political warfare and all hostile acts during the negotiations. 

 <h3>  The Palestinians</h3>

   <b>Declaration of a State</b>
<p>
   A unilateral Palestinian declaration of the establishment of a
   Palestinian state will constitute a fundamental and substantive
   violation of the agreements with the State of Israel and the scuttling
   of the Oslo and Wye accords. The government will adopt immediate
   stringent measures in the event of such a declaration. 
<p>
 <b>  Settlements</b>
<p>
   The Jewish communities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza are the
   realization of Zionist values. Settlement of the land is a clear
   expression of the unassailable right of the Jewish people to the
   Land of Israel and constitutes an important asset in the defense of
   the vital interests of the State of Israel. The Likud will continue to
   strengthen and develop these communities and will prevent their
   uprooting. 
<p>
  <b> The Partition of the Negev</b>
<p>
   Israel rejects out of hand ideas raised by Labor Party leaders
   concerning the relinquishment of parts of the Negev to the
   Palestinians. The practical meaning of this plan is that the &quot;Green
   Line&quot; should no longer be viewed as a &quot;Red Line&quot;, which draws us
   closer to the partition plan of 1947 as it opens the door to the
   principle that the fate of the Galilee, the Triangle and additional
   areas within Israel is negotiable. The Likud asserts that such
   proposals by the Labor Party leadership may literally cause the
   dismemberment of the State of Israel. 
<p>
   <b>Oslo &amp; Wye River Accords</b>
<p>
   The Government of Israel will safeguard the state's vital interests in
   the negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. Having established
   and meticulously adhered to the principle of reciprocity in the
   negotiations and implementation of agreements, including the Wye
   River Memorandum, the government will continue to condition
   implementation on the fulfillment of Palestinian commitments. The
   government will continue to insist on the fulfillment of the following
   Palestinian obligations: 
<p>
   <b>The War on Terror</b>
<p>
   The Palestinian Authority must wage a systematic war on the terror
   organizations and their infrastructure. The PA must not only
   intensify its efforts to prevent attacks, but act with determination to
   prevent potential terrorist acts by dismantling the terrorist
   infrastructure that has developed and expanded in PA areas since
   the Oslo accords. 
<p>
  <b> Halting Incitement</b>
<p>
   Halting incitement against Israel in the Palestinian media,
   educational system and all other Palestinian institutions, and
   turning the Palestinian media and educational system from their
   current anti-Israel mode to recognition of Israel and developing
   peaceful and good neighborly relations between Jews and Arabs. 
<p>
   <b>Weapons Collection</b>
<p>
   The confiscation of illegal weapons held by Palestinian civilians
   and the removal of weapons held by the PA forces in excess of
   those permitted under the agreement to areas outside PA territory. 
<p>
   <b>Reducing the Size of the PA Police</b>
<p>
   The size of the PA police must be reduced to the level permitted
   under the agreement. 
<p>
  <b> The Permanent Status</b>
<p>
   The overall objectives for the final status with the Palestinians are:
   to end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians on the basis
   of a stable, sustainable agreement and replace confrontation with
   cooperation and good neighborliness, while safeguarding Israel's
   vital interests as a secure and prosperous Zionist and Jewish state. 
<p>
   The Likud government will honor all the international agreements
   signed by its predecessors and strive to achieve a final status
   arrangement with the Palestinians. The only way to reach a final
   status arrangement is via dialogue and political negotiations. 
<p>
   The permanent status arrangement will minimize the security
   dangers implicit in the Oslo accords. The primary such danger is the
   presence and the possible expansion of the Palestinian security
   forces within close range of Israel's population centers, government
   offices, emergency warehouses and staging areas of the Israel
   Defense Forces. 
<p>
   The permanent status arrangement shall be based on the following
   principles: 
<p>
   <b>Self-Rule</b>
<p>
   The Government of Israel flatly rejects the establishment of a
   Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan river. 
<p>
   The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of
   self-rule, but not as an independent and sovereign state. Thus, for
   example, in matters of foreign affairs, security, immigration and
   ecology, their activity shall be limited in accordance with
   imperatives of Israel's existence, security and national needs. 
<p>
  <b> Jerusalem</b>
<p>
   Jerusalem is the eternal, united capital of the State of Israel and
   only of Israel. The government will flatly reject Palestinian proposals
   to divide Jerusalem, including the plan to divide the city presented
   to the Knesset by the Arab factions and supported by many
   members of Labor and Meretz. The government firmly rejects
   attempts of various sources in the world, some anti-Semitic in origin,
   to question Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital, and the
   3,000-year-old special connection between the Jewish people and
   its capital. To ensure this, the government will continue the firm
   policies it has adopted until now: 
<p>
   No diplomatic activity will be permitted at Orient House. The
   government stopped the stream of visits by heads of state and
   ministers at Orient House, begun under the left-wing government. 
<p>
   The presence of the Israeli police in eastern Jerusalem will be
   increased. This in addition to the new police posts and
   reinforcements in the neighborhoods. 
<p>
   The Likud government will act with vigor to continue Jewish
   habitation and strengthen Israeli sovereignty in the eastern parts of
   the city, while emphasizing improvements in the welfare and
   security of the Arab residents. Despite protests from the left, the
   Likud government consistently approved the continuation of Jewish
   living within the Old City and in 'City of David'. 
<p>
   <b>The Jordan River as a Permanent Border</b>
<p>
   The Jordan Valley and the territories that dominate it shall be under
   Israeli sovereignty. The Jordan river will be the permanent eastern
   border of the State of Israel. The Kingdom of Jordan is a desirable
   partner in the permanent status arrangement between Israel and the
   Palestinians in matters that will be agreed upon. 
<p>
   <b>Security Areas</b>
<p>
   The government succeeded in significantly reducing the extent of
   territory that the Palestinians expected to receive in the interim
   arrangement. The government will insist that security areas
   essential to Israel's defense, including the western security area
   and the Jewish settlements, shall remain under Israeli rule. 
<p>
  <b> The Golan</b>
<p>
   Based on the Likud-led government's proposal, the 10th Knesset
   passed the law to extend Israeli law, jurisdiction and administration
   over the Golan Heights, thus establishing Israeli sovereignty over
   the area. The government will continue to strengthen Jewish
   settlement on the Golan. 
<p>
   <b>Lebanon</b>
<p>
   Israel will act to implement UN Security Council resolution 425 to
   withdraw the IDF from Lebanon while ensuring appropriate security
   arrangements so as to defend its citizens in the north of the country
   and guarantee the security of South Lebanese Army members.
   Israel will refrain from rash steps that are likely to move the front line
   from southern Lebanon to the edge of the Galilee. 
<p>
   <b>Syria</b>
<p>
   Israel will continue to seek the renewal of peace negotiations with
   Syria without preconditions.
