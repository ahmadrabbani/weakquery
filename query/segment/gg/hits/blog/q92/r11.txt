The Israeli government also approved with a great majority a memorandum rejecting in advance the right of return ( to Palestine ) for the Palestinian refugees, according to the same source. Meantime, the Israeli army radio said yesterday that the Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon announced yesterday to his ministers that the in his view the roadmap is "the lesser of two evils," during a meeting for the Israeli government to discuss the approval of the "roadmap" international peace plan with the Palestinians. Sharon said replying to criticism by the most nationalist wing in his government " I, also do not support the roadmap " but it is the lesser of two evils." Sharon ruled out that Israel's acceptance of the Roadmap will be conducive to the establishment of a Palestinian state in the coming months, replying to fears expressed by one of his ministers on this issue. Before voting on this issue, the Israeli government studied the possibility of expressing reservations on the document, especially the issue of "the right of return for the Palestinian refugees," according to the same source. Israel, however, still rejects the return back of the Palestinian refugees of 1948 whose number tolls 7.3 million, on the ground that their return will affect the Jewish nature of Israel. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority considered the Israeli approval which is linked to "remarks" on the "Roadmap of the International peace plan" is not enough, stressing the need of implementing this plan without any amendments. Commenting on the decision of the Israeli government to accepting the Roadmap, Nabil Abu Rudinah, Arafat's advisor, said that "the consent of the Israeli government to the roadmap with reservations is not good enough."
