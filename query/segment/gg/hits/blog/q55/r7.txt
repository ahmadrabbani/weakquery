Agence France-Presse/Getty Images American cyclists Tyler Hamilton, left, and Lance Armstrong competing at an event in 2000.    American cyclist Tyler Hamilton, who rode with the U.S. Postal Service team from 1995 to 2001, said in a television interview with CBS's "60 Minutes" that he saw Mr. Armstrong inject EPO, a banned drug that boosts the number of red blood cells, more than once. Mr. Hamilton's career was derailed by two positive tests, once for a blood transfusion and again for a banned substance. According to a clip from the Sunday interview, released Thursday night, Mr. Hamilton also said he saw EPO stored in Mr. Armstrong's refrigerator.  Mr. Armstrong, 39 years old, won the Tour de France from 1999-2005. He retired earlier this year. "Tyler Hamilton is a confessed liar in search of a book deal—and he managed to dupe '60 Minutes,' " said Mark Fabiani, a lawyer for Mr. Armstrong. "Most people, though, will see this for exactly what it is: More washed-up cyclists talking trash for cash." A spokesman for 60 Minutes said on Thursday, "Our story will speak for itself Sunday."  Mr. Fabiani said his client late Thursday created a website,  www.Facts4Lance.com , to counter Mr. Hamilton's allegations. From the Archives   Cyclist Armstrong Denies Doping  5/20/2010    Doping Claims Roil Cycling  5/21/2010    Blood Brothers  7/2/2010    The Case of the Missing Bikes  7/3/2010     The public statements by Mr. Hamilton, 40, who raced alongside Mr. Armstrong in the Tour de France for three seasons, come almost exactly one year after The Wall Street Journal first disclosed that cyclist Floyd Landis had sent a series of emails to cycling officials and sponsors claiming that he and Mr. Armstrong allegedly participated in doping. Mr. Landis's 2006 Tour de France victory was nullified after a positive doping test  The allegations by Mr. Landis triggered a federal investigation into doping in professional cycling.  Mr. Hamilton testified last year before a grand jury after receiving a subpoena.  The U.S. criminal investigation, which is being led by the Food and Drug Administration, isn't aimed at prosecuting rank-and-file riders who used performance-enhancing drugs during their careers, according to people familiar with the investigation. Rather, it is designed to potentially bring charges against any team leaders and team directors who may have facilitated or encouraged doping by their riders. Investigators last spring subpoenaed several former U.S. Postal riders, including Mr. Hamilton and cyclist George Hincapie. According to a person a familiar with the matter, the federal probe into cycling has expanded overseas. Mr. Hincapie's lawyer declined to comment.  In an email to his friends and family sent Thursday afternoon and reviewed by the Journal, Mr. Hamilton said the federal investigation triggered him to tell "the whole truth" for the first time, leading him to conclude that "this was the way forward" for him.  FDA special agent Jeff Novitzky, the lead investigator, had no comment. The investigation is still ongoing.
