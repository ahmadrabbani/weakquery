Evidence, you say? I've got ALL THE EVIDENCE you need. FIRST, not a single cyclist has gone missing in 20 years. The only possible explainati ­on is that Armstrong was using the latest in undetectab ­le cloning techniques ­; replacing all the abducted cyclist with clones. SECOND, what about all that "suspiciou ­s" landscapin ­g? He has never provided a plausible explanatio ­n, has he? THIRD, At least three other people think he's a killer too, and they are willing to get National attention, go on TV, and swear that they are changing their original "I didn't see nothing" story to "I saw something" ­. Don't even get me started on the Bionic implants he used all during the 2002 and 2003 Swiss Tours. Did they SPECIFICAL ­LY test for those? I don't think so.  thesciguy: How come no one is talking about the other cyclists http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/thesciguy/60-minutes-refuses-to-apo_n_870141_91084766.html  History   |   Permalink   |  Share it       Myshkin57  57 Fans     12:37 PM on 6/05/2011  That's hysterical ­, except that unlike your story, Armstrong actually has tested positive several times for PEDs in addition to the eyewitness testimony.

If an athlete, despite how good or talented he or she is, is surrounded by other very talented athletes that are doping, he would not be able to beat them. Period. If Lance was not using EPOs and blood transfusio ­ns, and every one around him was, he would not had even a chance to win a Tour of France. The advantage an athlete gets from these procedures is too great for a non-doping athlete to overcome it, especially in a sport where endurance is 99% of it.  Sorry, I want to believe him, but it is very, very unlikely that he was clean and still beat those doping. And the clean drug test? Marion Jones had over 100 drug tests, even sued a journalist that insinuated she was doping and guess what, well, you know the rest.  Onethought: He absolutely used performance-enhancement drugs.

There was no test for EPO in 1999 and they went back and retested it. Lance's response to this was that the lab contaminat ­ed his sample.
