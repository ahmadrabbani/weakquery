He was a top amateur cyclist until after the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, when he began a successful pro career. In 1996 Armstrong discovered that he had testicular cancer, which had spread to his brain and lungs. After surgery and heavy chemotherapy, Armstrong returned to cycling in 1997. Two years later he won his first Tour de France, as the lead rider of the U.S. Postal Service team, and then repeated the victory the next five years in a row. In 2005 he won the Tour for a seventh time, then retired from cycling. After nearly four years in retirement, he un-retired and raced in the Tour de France again in 2009, finishing third as his teammate Alberto Contador won the race. Armstrong then retired  again in 2011, amid continued -- and unverified -- allegations that he had used performance enhancing drugs.
