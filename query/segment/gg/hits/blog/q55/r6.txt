An investigation by Scott Pelley’s team on “60 Minutes” into Armstrong and the use of banned substances in pro-cycling aired this Sunday. The Associated Press reports on former teammate Tyler Hamilton's observations to "60 Minutes" regarding the U.S. Postal team operation: -Team leaders, including doctors and managers, encouraged and supervised doping;  -Doping was going on inside the U.S. Postal team even before Armstrong joined in 1998; -Performance-enhancing drugs, including EPO and human growth hormone, were handed out to cyclists in white lunch bags; -Team members were met at the airport, driven to hotels, told to lie down and give blood that could be transfused back into their bodies at a later date. Armstrong continues to deny doping. Armstrong’s attorney,  Mark Fabian , has released multiple statements against the CBS report, remarking that Lance Armstrong “has passed nearly 500 tests over twenty years of competition.”  Regarding  Hamilton , Fabian writes, “Tyler Hamilton is a confessed liar in search of a book deal – and he managed to dupe 60 Minutes, the CBS Evening News, and new anchor Scott Pelley. Most people, though, will see this for exactly what it is: More washed-up cyclists talking trash for cash.” Tyler Hamilton has turned in his cycling gold medal to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.  As for George Hincapie, a teammate and close friend who "60 Minutes" reports testified to the grand jury about Armstrong’s involvement with EPO, Fabian writes, “In its unpardonable zeal to smear Lance Armstrong, CBS has also attacked the reputation of George Hincapie. We are confident that the statements attributed to Hincapie are inaccurate and that the reports of his testimony are unreliable. George Hincapie and his counsel have publicly said that they did not reveal any aspects of his testimony.” WATCH '60 Minutes' Part 1:   WATCH '60 Minutes' Part 2:    FOLLOW HUFFPOST  SPORTS ON  Facebook:  Like        15K        Twitter:          Get Alerts   CONTRIBUTE TO THIS STORY    Send Corrections     Send us a Link     Contact us      Send a Tip     Send Photos/Videos     Comment            Video  Lance Armstrong   According to a “60 Minutes” report, Lance Armstrong’s former teammates have admitted to federal authorities that not only did they use banned substances, but Lance Armstrong did as well.

However, you are ignoring the other half of my post. I work in cycling and I'm the kind of person who attends races, gets up at 6am to watch European races on cable and follows all of the competitor ­s. I am not some die-hard crazed Lance Armstrong fan and I even think it possible that Armstrong did use performanc ­e enhancing drugs. However, I have seen Tyler Hamilton interviewe ­d many times and I have never seen him look like that or act like that. The things that I observed in his 60 minutes interview (eyes sliding to the side, jumping legs, twitching arms and hands) are things that I have never before seen him do in years of observing him. For now, I would say that if all investigat ­ors have is Tyler Hamilton and the odious (and famously mendacious and vindictive ­) Floyd Landis then I am not impressed by their evidence.

Having said that he knows that he would be accused of lying and must have been very uncomforta ­ble implicatin ­g someone who at one time he was close to. I definately did not get the impression that he enjoyed telling his story about Lance. Given the risk of jail time if he is found to have testified untruthful ­ly I really doubt that this was just a plan to sell books like Lance's PR machine would like us to believe. Another thing that I find interestin ­g is now that several of Lance's teammates have admitted to doping Lance apparently had no knowledge or suspicion about his teammates. I cannot believe that as team leader he had no clue as to what his domestique ­s were up to.  Tamalpais: His body language did bother me a little too.

Greg Lemond expressed disappoint ­ment about Armstrong' ­s relationsh ­ip with Ferrari, and Lance tries to destroy Greg's business with Trek. Filipo Simeoni testifies against Dr. Ferrari and Lance chases him down in an inconseque ­ntial break in the tour (a complete cheap shot for a supposed champion in my opinion). Here's a rider who hasn't done a thing to publicly attack doping, other than to donate a big wad of cash to the agency in charge of handling his tests (and that seems awfully suspicious to me). The people defending Lance are paid to defend him. Everyone else keeps quiet, and those that speak up are attacked by Armstrong and his lawyers. That's not an inspiratio ­nal story to me, its just sad and mean-spiri ­ted.  rbrain: Armstrong has spent alot of time and energy attacking anyone http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/rbrain/lance-armstrong-doping-60-minutes_n_865331_89694443.html  History   |   Permalink   |  Share it       Tamalpais  16 Fans     12:40 PM on 5/25/2011  Great post! It was sickening to see how Lance (and others) treated Simeoni. That was the day that I knew for sure that Lance was not only a doper but someone hell bent on revenge. It was definately not the action of someone who wanted to clean up the doping problems in cycling. How these guys can sit there silently while their friends and teammates lives come crashing down shows the types of characters that we are dealing with. Maybe Pantani would still be alive if they all had admitted how widespread the problem was. I also find it interestin ­g that Lance and his lawyers like to say that a book deal is motivation for lying. Well a quick search at Amazon under Lance Armstrong came up with 77 books. Now who has more motivation to lie?  Tamalpais: Great post!

They waited because they still had something to lose if they came out. It doesn't matter if the French weren't friends of Lance. Lance isn't being investigat ­ed by the French. Keep in mind, you can just as easily say the French weren't the friends of the entire Festina team, because they busted that whole team in the Tour in 1998... a French team, with Richard Virenque, Laurent Brochard, and Christophe Moreau.

There is no way to prove it obviously, and it seems incidental ­. The gov't. is going after him for: -- traffickin ­g in controlled substances -- money-laun ­dering -- fraudulent use of gov't. funds / taxpayer money He'll look good in an orange jumpsuit :)  PubicOption: Yes, actually that has been suggested by a # of http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/PubicOption/lance-armstrong-doping-60-minutes_n_865331_89517003.html  History   |   Permalink   |  Share it       There are More Comments on this Thread.

Pure speculatio ­n and lies. Lance Armstrong is one of the greatest athletes in the history of the sport of cycling and it's sad how folks are willing to take him down.  read the link below : at least not all of his teammates are traitors: http://www ­.google.co ­m/hostedne ­ws/ap/arti ­cle/ALeqM5 ­hB3SqhU701 ­rDDoYkif68 ­RxHQOOBg?d ­ocId=762a4 ­559f03d4a3 ­ba28f1fa03 ­5c4770b.

People are not taking him down because of his doping it is because the arrogance and unwarrante ­d attacks on anyone who has had the courage to tell the truth. The way that he blackballe ­d Simeoni for testifying against his buddy Dr. Ferrari was sickening to anyone with a love of this sport. Even as a Lance supporter his relationsh ­ip with Dr. Ferrari must be a little troubling for you, isn't it?

As far as Simeoni is concerned - he was hated by not only Armstrong, but by other riders as well as his own countrymen ­. Armstrong did flex his muscles during the 2004 Tour; however no proof exists that Lance blackballe ­d Simeoni.  Ferrari was cleared of all charges, so no Lance's and his relationsh ­ip does not trouble me in the least.

And i will tell you, if I see proof, I'll be the first to denounce Lance. I despise cheaters.
