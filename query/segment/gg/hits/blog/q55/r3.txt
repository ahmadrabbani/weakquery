Enlarge This Image     Christophe Ena/Associated Press Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times, but he has been dogged by charges of doping, most recently by Tyler Hamilton.   Related Armstrong Teammate Describes Doping System (May 23, 2011)      It’s all there on the Zapruder tape: Armstrong’s bicycle is ensnared by a plastic bag held by a witless spectator; Armstrong goes down;  Jan Ullrich of Germany and other leaders appear to be pedaling onward; every second counts; but Hamilton — an American, a former teammate of Armstrong’s — seems to catch up with them as a visible reminder of Tour etiquette, that riders should never profit from such a mishap; they slow to wait for Armstrong to recover.  “Hard to say,” Armstrong said Monday. “It can be interpreted a lot of different ways.”  Armstrong added in a telephone conversation that he has heard  different versions of that spill and the aftermath, involving Ullrich, who was  barred from the Tour in 2007 for suspicions of doping, or with Hamilton, who has been barred since losing his 2004 Olympic title for testing positive for blood doping.  Now retired, Armstrong, 39, is not likely to be schmoozing about the old days, not since  Hamilton publicly accused him on “60 Minutes” of systematically cheating to win his seven consecutive Tours from 1999 through 2005.  According to Hamilton, Armstrong provided illegal drugs to teammates; showed them how to use them; used secret cellphones and code words like Edgar Allan Poe for EPO, the blood-boosting drug; flew Hamilton to Spain for illegal doping; and paid his way out of a positive test.  These charges, made by a rider from the core of the sport, come exactly one year after charges by the disgraced Floyd Landis that Armstrong presided over the drugging of a generation of the best team cycling has ever seen. I wrote then that it would be hard for Armstrong to stage a breakaway from Landis’s charges. Not much has changed as Hamilton made his charges to Scott Pelley, soon to be the anchor on CBS News.  Hamilton looked haunted and twitchy on “60 Minutes,” worse than he did in 2003 while riding the Tour with his broken collarbone held together by tape. But his charges sounded much like what Landis said about Armstrong.  “I stand by our statement of last week with regard to what they call the facts of the show,” Armstrong said when he returned a call Monday. His lawyers and spokesmen have  issued rebuttals , and Armstrong did not want to get into specifics.  “More importantly, I’m not going to let this distract me,” he said. “I’m just not. I have a lot of stuff going on, a lot of positive stuff.” His foundation fights cancer, which almost killed him, and he does not need to spell out that he is an icon to a lot of people who want to believe the best of him. “I have an incredible organization that is not going to be derailed by news from last century,” he said.  Those ancient times do not go away. A grand jury in California is looking into possible fraud and perjury while Armstrong was representing the United States Postal Service. He has often said that the U.S.P.S. made money from him, and has no problem with him. He calls himself the most tested athlete in history, which could be true.  There are some  allegedly positive EPO tests from 1999 that appear to match his name and number, but which have no legal standing. And he set off some bells in a laboratory after testing positive for steroids, but that was quickly annulled by a postdated  prescription for saddle sores , which was a surprise to his masseuse, who said she would have known. And on Sunday, Hamilton accused Armstrong of having a positive test in a Swiss tuneup race quashed by writing a check to the International Cycling Union, which on Monday denied there was any cover-up in return for a $25,000 donation and a later $100,000 gift for a testing machine.  As for the allegations of a plane ride to Spain for blood doping before the Tour?  “I can’t deny that we would have traveled to races and training camps and team functions together,” Armstrong said, including the use of jets. He stuck by the general denial of the charges and emphasized the passage of time.  The grand jury could indict Armstrong, or it could drop the investigation, and people will think what they want. The evidence — technical and anecdotal — of the last decade suggests that the whole sport has been dirty for a generation, if not always.  The dangers and skills are a visceral part of the sport as the riders speed through Europe. One rider was killed in Italy this month. Yet Tour etiquette, the camaraderie among racers, is part of the mix. People are still debating whether an injured Hamilton saved Armstrong’s title in 2003.  “A lot of people said he was not waiting and a lot of people, probably more, said he was,” Armstrong said about his old rival Ullrich. “When you can see the images, Tyler went up and said, ‘Hey, slow down, stop,’ but there were other people there who said: ‘Hey, what are you talking about, he’s not trying to ride away. He’s waiting.’ It’s a coin toss.”  It has become something of a coin toss whether one lone ranger could remain squeaky clean while leaving dirty riders in his wake. Isn’t that what innocent-until-proven-guilty laws and due process are there to protect?
