Tapes: Time and place to be determined. Premiere Date: October 2010 Overview:  In August 2010, CBS announced sit-com star Sara Gilbert, who played middle child Darlene on ABC's   Roseanne  in the 1980s and 1990s, would lead a panel of mothers discussing current events and hot issues on a new talk show title,  The Talk . The show replaces the cancelled soap opera  As the World Turns on CBS. When the show debuted, it's co-hosts included Julie Chen, who left her co-host duties on CBS's   The Early Show  , actresses Holly Robinson Peete and Leah Remini, and international star and former talk show host Sharon Osbourne. The show often draws comparisons to ABC's   The View  . But Gilbert and co-hosts assure viewers that the show presents a unique viewpoint - that coming from mothers raising children in the new century - even if it touches on similar topics. Conflict promises to bubble up in the way of how each parent raises their children. In a  Movieline interview, Chen says she could see herself questioning the parenting technique of co-host Winokur. Chen has a 10-month-old son and Winokur has a 2-year-old son. After announcing the show, host Gilbert made her sexual orientation public. She and her former partner Allison Adler have a son and daughter. "I don't ever really think of things as out or in," Gilbert explained during a 2010  The Talk panel. "I just think I am who I am, and when topics come up that are appropriate, I'll talk about them and share when it seems right." Osbourne is best known as the mother to  Dancing with the Stars star Kelly Osbourne and aspiring music producer Jack Osbourne. Oh, and spouse of Rock and Roll Hall of Famer  Ozzy Osbourne . Executive producer Brad Bessey is known for his work on  Entertainment Tonight .  In late summer 2011, Remini and Robinson Peete were asked to leave  The Talk . Remini tweeted her departure and mentioned that she was given no reason as to why her contract wasn't renewed.
