He later discovered a mountaintop vantage point above the base, thus bringing Area 51 out of the shadows and into the realm of an international discovery. He was also the first to break national stories in the world press not only on Area 51, but also on The Dulce Mesa, The Phoenix Lights, The Chupacabra, The Area 51 Alien Interview, and The Adrain Pleiadian Contactee Case.

At age 16, his family lived in Cairo, Egypt, being some of the first Americans welcomed in to boost trade and commerce as Anwar Sadat's regime turned from the USSR in the East to the United States in the West. It was there that Sean was deeply affected by his experiences at British International school, by the Moslem children he befriended, and, mostly, by the Great Pyramid of Giza. Spending the night in the Great Pyramid several times, and talking to Imam's and Rabbi's and Coptic Christian clerics, Sean began to see the great pattern, prophecy and grand journey laid out for all mankind by the most wondrous and mysterious structure on Earth. In 2005, Sean received his PhD. doctorate in Therapeutic Psychology and counseling from the International Institute of Health and Spiritual Sciences in Montreal, Canada. Sean also hosted his own national radio show on over 250 stations on two national networks and has been a the #1 most popular guest on Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell for over 13 years since his first appearance in 1991.

Greenewave Radio  Host:  Christopher Greene Website:   www.greenewave.com   Program Archives  Call-in Number:  (402) 237 - 2525 Time:  Tuesdays & Thursdays, 3:00 pm -5 pm Central Starting Thursday 08/25/11     Christopher Greene is a dynamic independent economist, activist, investigative journalist, frequent video-blogger and author of several monthly newsletters. With a unique background in finance and real estate, Christopher has pioneered and redefined the concept of Alternative Media. In 2008, Christopher awakened to the fraud and corruption evident in Washington, the Federal Reserve, our regulatory agencies and the Too-Big-to-Fail banks during the height of the financial crisis. Christopher believes whole-heartedly in the concept of freedom, would describe himself as a free-spirited capitalist and believes that we must act now to prepare for an even more devastating economic collapse in the very near future. It is clear that a kick-the-can-down-the-road strategy currently being implemented by the Federal Reserve will only result in greater imbalances in global capital markets and help to inflate even larger and more aggressive asset bubbles that will eventually collapse. Fraud and corruption is now generally accepted among the apathetic public while the strategy being implemented by our leadership is one that is clearly unsustainable. Christopher attended George Washington University on athletic scholarship at our Nation's Capital in Washington D.C., graduated with a degree in Finance from Arizona State and is a former Division I Water Polo All-American. Clearly an immense talent, Christopher has quickly become one of the most talked about and explosive media personalities on the Web today.

Unable to work or have an employer in the conventional sense Vincent went out with frustration at the mainstream media and began to make his own news by interviewing the activists about real issues that truly affect New Zealand and the world. The idea is to get the activists who live and breathe the issues and are not bound by corporate or political parties to be the pundits reporters and watch dogs on the multi-faceted agendas of the global elite right here at home. He hopes to one day be part of an alternative media revolution that will replace the mainstream media, for they are no longer relevant.

His family has lived in the same small coastal town since 1690. He is descended from a Scottish Royalist P.O.W. sold into slavery through the London Slave Market in 1650 after his Clan lost the decisive Battle of September during the English Civil War and Protestant Ascendancy. After 13 years in the bog iron mines of Quincy, Mass. Ancestor X found a new home here in the Colonies settling on the Northeast shore. Born with a 'wanderlust' Frater X set out from his colonial hometown at a very young age. In true mystic beatnik bardic fashion he drifted the land, "...moaning for man..." in search of the post-modern "American Zeitgeist". His travels took him to Rainbow tribes and Gatherings, Road Kid refugee camps, and sword wielding Druids living in old-growth trees in the forest of the Pacific Northwest. After ten years of "vagabondage" he had wandered America from coast to coast gathering experiences, and wisdom. He returned to the Northeast in the mid-90's after a month camping in the Arizona desert on Havasupai and Navaho lands. He attended several semesters at UMass on a Philosophy/Comparative Religious studies program. He was elected President of the Philosophy Club the first semester of his Freshman year. After viewing Oliver Stone's JFK in the 90's he began a quest for the Truth which led him to over 15 years of extensive research into Conspiracy Theories, Fringe Sciences, New Thought concepts, Ancient and forbidden knowledge and wisdom. Tracing his own family tree back from New England to Scotland in 1650, and eventually 9th Century Ireland, it seems he comes from a long line of Initiates on The Quest in search of the Grail-in fact one of his ancestors was a member of an "Order of the Grail" in Scotland in the 14th century. Frater X is a published author of both speculative fiction, and critical research. He is a lecturer of esoteric philosophies and Mystery Traditions. He is considered a prolific analyst and commentator among his Masonic peers. As a member of nine different Esoteric Orders including the Knights Templar, Knight Masons, Rosicrucians, and Ancient Order of Druids, Frater X brings a well-versed and truly unique perspective to the microphone. Tapping into a strong optimism and belief in the resilience and inherent goodness of humanity he is committed to help guide and be guided by others along the paths of Truth leading to Transformation and Self-Actualization. All the while pondering Life's big questions of: Who are we? Where did we come from? and Where are we going? Join Frater and his many great Guests as they explore the Known and Unknown!
