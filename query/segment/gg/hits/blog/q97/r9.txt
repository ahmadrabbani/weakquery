Cheers!   By  Tierney Bricker       November 9, 2010 12:29 PM ET  Follow @tbrick2 on  Twitter    You cannot miss Wednesday's (Nov. 10) episode of   "The Oprah Winfrey Show."  In what has got to be the coolest "class" reunion ever,   Oprah Winfrey  is having a slew of former talk show hosts on her to celebrate the 25th and final season of the show.  The esteemed former hosts set to appear?   Geraldo Rivera   : Produced and hosted the daytime talk show  "Geraldo" (later changed to "The Geraldo Rivera Show"), which ran for 11 years.   Ricki Lake : Hosted  "Ricki Lake," which was also on the air for 11 years. Known for its infamous crowd cheer, "Go Ricki! Go Ricki!"  Phil Donahue : Creator and host of  "The Phil Donahue Show" (also known as "Donahue"), which had an incredible 26-year run.  Sally Jesse Raphael:  Hosted  "Sally" (originally called "The Sally Jesse Raphael Show") for 19 years.   Montel Williams : Hosted  "The Montel Williams Show" (which was also known as "Montel"), for 17 years.   All five will who will sit down to talk about their experiences as hosts with Oprah. Unfortunately for us (not for them),  Jerry Springer and  Maury Povich's shows are still on the air so they are missing out on this reunion hosted by the Queen Bee herself.
