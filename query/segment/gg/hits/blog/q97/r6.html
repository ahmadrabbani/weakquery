                  <p align="left" class="style8">Sean first achieved national recognition when his expeditions to Area 51 made front-page news in newspapers across America, including the LA Times. He later discovered a mountaintop vantage point above the base, thus bringing Area 51 out of the shadows and into the realm of an international discovery. He was also the first to break national stories in the world press not only on Area 51, but also on The Dulce Mesa, The Phoenix Lights, The Chupacabra, The Area 51 Alien Interview, and The Adrain Pleiadian Contactee Case. Since then, Sean has appeared on, written, directed, produced and consulted for many television programs including Hard Copy, Strange Universe, Sightings, Now it Can Be Told, and The Conspiracy Zone.<br><br>At age 16, his family lived in Cairo, Egypt, being some of the first Americans welcomed in to boost trade and commerce as Anwar Sadat's regime turned from the USSR in the East to the United States in the West. It was there that Sean was deeply affected by his experiences at British International school, by the Moslem children he befriended, and, mostly, by the Great Pyramid of Giza. Spending the night in the Great Pyramid several times, and talking to Imam's and Rabbi's and Coptic Christian clerics, Sean began to see the great pattern, prophecy and grand journey laid out for all mankind by the most wondrous and mysterious structure on Earth.<br><br>In 2005, Sean received his PhD. doctorate in Therapeutic Psychology and counseling from the International Institute of Health and Spiritual Sciences in Montreal, Canada. Sean also hosted his own national radio show on over 250 stations on two national networks and has been a the #1 most popular guest on Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell for over 13 years since his first appearance in 1991.</p>

Where most just discuss the events as they happen and there effect on us; Christie explores the causes that make them happen.<br><br>Christie has been described as the most fearless woman alive; willing to go where no man dares wander. Christie's uncanny ability to get to the crux of an issue and return with the Truth, combined with her ability to bring people of all walks of life together; may be the single strongest asset We the People have in this battle for Freedom and Liberty that Humanity finds itself losing! Christie truly does not mess around with the fringes of the problems she goes after the big people with the money and the guns and gets them!<br><br>Christie was forced into acting against the corruption she watched grow in her home town. In her year of shows Christie has done something no one else has; seek to define the common problems and find comprehensive working solutions. She says, "The Truth is Self Evident!" She has appeared and is a favored guest on many Shows across the Nation.<br><br>This is one show you will not want to miss if you are interested in knowing more about the Truth as it is in the world you live.<br><br>Christie was born in Chula Vista, California, grew up and went to high school there. She was a star athlete and excelled in all of the areas she applied herself. The proud mother of two beautiful daughters and a very hard worker, she currently suffers from injuries related to the attacks of those she exposes.</p>

                  <p align="left" class="style8">Christopher Greene is a dynamic independent economist, activist, investigative journalist, frequent video-blogger and author of several monthly newsletters. With a unique background in finance and real estate, Christopher has pioneered and redefined the concept of Alternative Media. In 2008, Christopher awakened to the fraud and corruption evident in Washington, the Federal Reserve, our regulatory agencies and the Too-Big-to-Fail banks during the height of the financial crisis.<br><br>Christopher believes whole-heartedly in the concept of freedom, would describe himself as a free-spirited capitalist and believes that we must act now to prepare for an even more devastating economic collapse in the very near future. It is clear that a kick-the-can-down-the-road strategy currently being implemented by the Federal Reserve will only result in greater imbalances in global capital markets and help to inflate even larger and more aggressive asset bubbles that will eventually collapse. Fraud and corruption is now generally accepted among the apathetic public while the strategy being implemented by our leadership is one that is clearly unsustainable.<br><br>Christopher attended George Washington University on athletic scholarship at our Nation's Capital in Washington D.C., graduated with a degree in Finance from Arizona State and is a former Division I Water Polo All-American. Clearly an immense talent, Christopher has quickly become one of the most talked about and explosive media personalities on the Web today.</p>

                  <p align="left" class="style8">Vincent Eastwood (AKA MR. NEWS) was born in the ominous year of 1984, the same year set out in Orwells masterpiece and the year of New Zealands neoliberal economic reforms. After working in the telecommunications industry he quit when he noticed that when he lied to the customer the companies profit margins went up. Unable to work or have an employer in the conventional sense Vincent went out with frustration at the mainstream media and began to make his own news by interviewing the activists about real issues that truly affect New Zealand and the world. The idea is to get the activists who live and breathe the issues and are not bound by corporate or political parties to be the pundits reporters and watch dogs on the multi-faceted agendas of the global elite right here at home. He hopes to one day be part of an alternative media revolution that will replace the mainstream media, for they are no longer relevant. He runs a website <a href="http://www.guerillamedia.co.nz">www.guerillamedia.co.nz</a> and a youtube channel <a href="http://www.youtube.com/mrnewsguerillamedia">www.youtube.com/mrnewsguerillamedia.</a></p>

                  <p align="left" class="style8">Frater X began his journey in colonial New England in 1970. His family has lived in the same small coastal town since 1690. He is descended from a Scottish Royalist P.O.W. sold into slavery through the London Slave Market in 1650 after his Clan lost the decisive Battle of September during the English Civil War and Protestant Ascendancy.<br><br>After 13 years in the bog iron mines of Quincy, Mass. Ancestor X found a new home here in the Colonies settling on the Northeast shore.<br><br>Born with a 'wanderlust' Frater X set out from his colonial hometown at a very young age. In true mystic beatnik bardic fashion he drifted the land, "...moaning for man..." in search of the post-modern "American Zeitgeist".<br><br>His travels took him to Rainbow tribes and Gatherings, Road Kid refugee camps, and sword wielding Druids living in old-growth trees in the forest of the Pacific Northwest. After ten years of "vagabondage" he had wandered America from coast to coast gathering experiences, and wisdom.<br><br>He returned to the Northeast in the mid-90's after a month camping in the Arizona desert on Havasupai and Navaho lands. He attended several semesters at UMass on a Philosophy/Comparative Religious studies program. He was elected President of the Philosophy Club the first semester of his Freshman year.<br><br>After viewing Oliver Stone's JFK in the 90's he began a quest for the Truth which led him to over 15 years of extensive research into Conspiracy Theories, Fringe Sciences, New Thought concepts, Ancient and forbidden knowledge and wisdom.<br><br>Tracing his own family tree back from New England to Scotland in 1650, and eventually 9th Century Ireland, it seems he comes from a long line of Initiates on The Quest in search of the Grail-in fact one of his ancestors was a member of an "Order of the Grail" in Scotland in the 14th century.<br><br>
                  Frater X is a published author of both speculative fiction, and critical research. He is a lecturer of esoteric philosophies and Mystery Traditions. He is considered a prolific analyst and commentator among his Masonic peers.<br><br>As a member of nine different Esoteric Orders including the Knights Templar, Knight Masons, Rosicrucians, and Ancient Order of Druids, Frater X brings a well-versed and truly unique perspective to the microphone.<br><br>Tapping into a strong optimism and belief in the resilience and inherent goodness of humanity he is committed to help guide and be guided by others along the paths of Truth leading to Transformation and Self-Actualization.<br><br>All the while pondering Life's big questions of: Who are we? Where did we come from? and Where are we going?

                  <p align="left" class="style8">Casper Leitch got involved in the hemp movement in 1990 and launched the cable television series 'Time 4 Hemp' on January 5, 1991.  It was the first television series in the history of broadcasting to focus strictly on the topic of cannabis, thus giving Casper the dubious honor of being known as 'The Father Of Marijuana Television'. He was a participant in the United States Government Funded 'UCLA Smoked Marijuana Study' headed by Dr. Donald Tashkin and is the first person in the world have television filmed footage of themselves smoking legal marijuana in a Government funded lab.<br><br> 
                  Over the years, 'Time 4 Hemp' has remained on the cutting edge of the Marijuana Movement by opening the Time4Hemp.com website in 1999 and being one of the first sites to offer free audio and video downloads.

                  <p align="left" class="style8">Mack White</b> is a comic book artist, illustrator, writer, and parapolitical researcher who lives in Austin, Texas. White's first professionally published story was "El Bandito Muerto" which appeared in Rip Off Comix in 1990. Throughout the 1990s, he contributed to a number of comics anthologies (most notably Zero Zero, Buzz and Snake Eyes), magazines (Details, Heavy Metal, Boing-Boing, and others), and newspapers (Austin Chronicle and Austin American-Statesman). His books include: The Mutant Book of the Dead (Starhead, 1994); Villa of the Mysteries 1, 2, and 3 (Fantagraphics, 1996-98); and The Bush Junta (Fantagraphics, 2004), a political comics anthology which he co-edited with Gary Groth. White's artwork has also been featured in many art shows, including the Comics on the Verge show which was presented by the Yerba Buena Arts Center in 2003 and later toured galleries and universities throughout the United States. White has been interviewed in many magazines, including Rolling Stone and The Comics Journal, and in the 1995 documentary Day 51: The True Story of Waco. He has illustrated numerous books, including Raw Deal (Blast Books) and The Last Renegade (Trails End Press), as well as album covers, such as The Cactus Brothers (Capitol Records). 
                  Quoting White's Wikipedia entry: "White's early stories were bizarre, darkly humorous, and dealt with metaphysical themes. In reviewing his work in the Comics on the Verge show, the Baltimore City Paper described his work as combining "an illustrative style reminiscent of serial adventure comic strips with the paranoia of Robert Anton Wilson's The Illuminatus Trilogy." Later, his work became more political, the best known examples being "Dead Silence in the Brain: The CIA Assassination of John Lennon" (The Comics Journal Summer Special 2001); "Operation Northwoods" (The Comics Journal Winter Special 2002); "1963," an autobiographical account of growing up in the Dallas area during the Kennedy assassination, which appeared in Roadstrips (Chronicle Books, 2006); The Bush Junta, in which White and 22 other cartoonists told the history of the George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush presidential administrations in comic strip form..." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_White">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_White)</a><br><br>
                  <b>SMiles Lewis</b> has had a lifelong interest in all things anomalous. An early age proclivity at recalling his nightly dreams as well as several personal experiences with ESP, precognition and dream switching bolstered his interest in the paranormal. Shortly after high-school he joined the local MUFON chapter in Austin, Texas. He would later become a MUFON State Section Director for that group as well as leader of the local UFO Experiencer Support and Study Group. A lover of books, SMiles collected over 1000 titles before founding his own non-profit Anomaly Archives that serves as the lending library of the Scientific Anomaly Institute. For over twenty years he has worked with digital audio, video and other bleeding edge internet technologies. He has published his own print journal, edited a local paranormal newspaper, maintained a large network of websites, organized a national UFO conference, spoken to anthropologists about UFOs and parapsychology, hosted  both terrestrial and webradio talk shows and has been podcasting since before the phrase existed. All these efforts and more have led radio talk show host Robert Larson to describe Miles as a "Gonzo Alt-Media Proprietor and Informationalist."</p>
