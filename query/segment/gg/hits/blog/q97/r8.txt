Breaking into this competitive field and advancing to one's desired position generally requires both education and experience.  Step 1: Get Involved in High School Aspiring radio talk show hosts can begin training as early as high school by participating in school clubs and taking courses in topics like public speaking, journalism, computers, English, theater and drama. This also can be a good time to start working on developing vocal qualities specific to a professional broadcast career by joining the debate team. Working or volunteering at a high school radio station also can offer valuable hands-on experience.  Step 2: Earn a Degree Enrolling in an associate's or bachelor's degree program in broadcasting, communications, journalism or a related major can be beneficial. Coursework in these programs generally covers a number of relevant areas, such as research techniques, reporting, media writing, ethics and communications. Seeking a professional mentor or adviser, preferably someone established in radio, also can help in gaining education and career guidance during this time.  Step 3: Pursue Internships Entry-level jobs in radio may require that a candidate have experience, so completing a professional internship while still in college can boost job prospects. Paid or unpaid experience at a college or local radio station can prepare one for work as an on-air announcer, disc jockey or another radio career. Interning as a behind-the-scenes assistant can be helpful in learning how a station functions and building other management skills required for some radio host positions.  Step 4: Enter The Radio Field Although entering the field as a talk show host or announcer is rare, another radio position, such as equipment operator or scheduler, can help one develop experience for more on-air radio positions. This can open the door for additional opportunities, such as a chance to read the weather forecast or make a public service announcement.  Step 5: Advance To The Desired Position According to October 2011 job postings on  Monster.com and  CareerBuilder.com , career advancement in radio may require experience with all facets of a station, from using radio programming software to booking guests. It also may require an audition or trial run with the station. Many talk show opportunities are part-time, but full-time host jobs do exist. Depending on the market, relocation may be necessary to find a radio talk show host position.
