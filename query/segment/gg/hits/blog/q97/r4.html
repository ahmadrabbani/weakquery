Divine Talk Show Hosts: What is the truth behind Channeling?<br>
by <A HREF="#author">Roar Bjonnes</A></font></H1>



<p align="justify">

<B><font color="#000080">Separating true mystical experience from our own mental projections

is not always easy.</font></B>
<p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

Welcome to the channeling zone. The TV screen yields an image of a fancy

hotel ballroom somewhere in California. A famous channeler sits on a large

wicker throne. She is dressed in a long white gown and graciously moves

her slender fingers with polished nails while she speaks. She is obviously

in some kind of trance while answering questions from the audience, many

of whom are Hollywood celebrities. She then walks down through the audience

while talking to people at random, giving advice, cracking jokes, all the

while conversing with a voice seemingly not her own.</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">From Los Angeles to New York City to Europe and beyond, these kinds

of channeled seances have become an increasingly popular New Age phenomenon.

Some of the channelers are rich and famous and draw large audiences, others

have smaller yet extremely devoted followers. But they all claim to speak

on behalf of bodiless spirits—wise men and women from earth or from other

planets. One is speaking on behalf of Jesus, another is claiming to channel

a well known Indian guru, and yet others amplify the voices of various

personalities who, they claim, lived thousands of years ago.</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">These channelers—who converse so effortlessly with angels, aliens, "ascended

masters" and gurus—are dismissed as charlatans by intellectuals and are

cursed by Christians as being the couriers of the Devil, others fear that

the phenomenon signals the precursor of another dark age of irrationality.

But the reality is probably more mundane: channeling has deep roots in

the Western notions of individualism and self-perfection. Having abandoned

mainstream religions for their lack of mysticism, joy, freedom of inquiry

and celebration, many are today seeking spiritual solace in an improvisational

realm of spirits and a potpourri of psychological and religious ideas.

Other traits of those flocking to the channeling zone are: deep distrust

for authority, morality and tradition, fear of the future, and, somewhat

ironically, an unquestioning passion for anything out of the ordinary.</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">About 20 physicists, sociologists, and psychologists recently convened

to study the famous channeler described above. She claims to receive messages

from a 35,000 year old being dressed in flowing garments of light. Through

biofeedback and an array of rigorous psychological tests, the panel of

experts concluded that she did not fake her experiences, and that something

"unusual" occurs when she enters her trance. But when determining the exact

source of her information, their opinions differed greatly.</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Does the channeled being exist in a metaphysical realm apart from her

mind? Is he a mythical figure of her own imagination? Is he a manifestation

of her higher self or consciousness? Or is the channeler simply schizophrenic?

The most compelling conclusion came from best-selling author and Jungian

analyst Thomas Moore. He determined that her "channeling was not part of

her [conscious] mind, not multiple personality disorder, but... coming

from the super-conscious mind."</font>

<H3 align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

The Yogic Mind</font></H3>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

Let us analyze this statement from the perspective of yoga. In yoga psychology,

the mind consists of five basic layers, which are as follows:</font>

<OL>

<LI>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

Conscious mind. This mental stage has three functions: a) sensing external

stimuli from the outside world through the sensory organs, b) having desires

on the basis of those stimuli, c) acting to materialize those desires.</font></LI>



<LI>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

Subconscious or subtle mind. This mental stage has four functions: a) memory,

b) contemplation, c) experience of pleasure and pain, d) dreaming.</font></LI>



<LI>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

Supramental or first layer of what psychologist Moore called the super-conscious

mind. This part of the mind has the capacity to transcend time, space and

person and see into past, present, and future. It is the layer of deep

intuition. In Jungian psychology, this is the collective unconscious or

super-conscious mind.</font></LI>



<LI>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

Subliminal mind or the second layer of the super-conscious mind. In this

stage discrimination and non-attachment are experienced, and one can discern

between eternal truth and the "passing show" of the material world.</font></LI>



<LI>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

Subtle causal mind or third layer of the super-conscious mind. Also termed

the "golden" layer as it signifies a state of pure bliss; only a thin veil

separates the individual and infinite consciousness.</font></LI>

</OL>



<H3 align="justify">

<FONT SIZE=+1 color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">How and Where Channeling Takes Place</FONT></H3>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

Using this ancient model of yogic psychology, we can establish that channeling

takes place between the second or third layer and, if genuine wisdom is

received, mostly in the third.</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Why did psychologist Thomas Moore conclude that the channeler contacts

her super-conscious mind and not a disembodied entity? Simply because it

does not appear to be possible, neither psychologically nor spiritually.

The mind, after dissociation from the physical body at death, until the

time of rebirth is a "bodiless mind". For the performance of action and

the perception of pleasure and pain, organs are necessary. In this state

of "bodiless mind", the conscious and subconscious portions of mind are

inactive and there is no experience of pleasure and pain. Since the bodiless

mind can experience or do nothing until its rebirth, attempts to contact

or influence these bodiless minds would be futile. Thus, according to yoga,

there is no heaven and hell and during death the mind is in a state of

limbo. While in this void, it waits until it is time to be reborn in an

environment in which the momentum of its past lives can be expressed.</font>

<H3 align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

The Holographic Mind</font></H3>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

&nbsp;But if death is an expressionless sleep, when the mind is completely

detached from the body, then how do we explain so-called near death experiences

(NDE's)?</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">While a person in a NDE may be clinically dead, his or her mind is still

functioning as it maintains a "weak connection" or parallelism with the

body. In this unconscious state, literally between life and death, a person

may have many dreamlike experiences. People who leave their bodies after

being diagnosed as clinically dead, have—after returning back to life—reported

seeing and communicating with "higher beings of light" or "vast libraries

of knowledge." But when these experiences have been analyzed, the libraries

they have seen can better be described as pictorial representations of

Cosmic Knowledge. These libraries or higher beings do not really exist,

rather they represent the way an individual translates the incoming knowledge

or wisdom from Cosmic Mind in a "holographic" fashion. In other words,

the libraries were "literally built out of knowledge."</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">University of London physicist David Bohm, one of the world's most respected

quantum physicists, and Stanford neurophysiologist Karl Pribram, one of

the architects of our modern understanding of the brain, believe that the

universe itself may be a giant hologram, quite literally a kind of image

or construct created, at least in part, by the human mind. Yes, only in

part by the human mind, because Cosmic Mind is the real creator of the

universe, and the human mind interprets or experiences what Cosmic Mind

creates. Consequently, one can assert that the cause of internal visions

and voices are of two kinds: (1) Psychic projections by an individual,

or (2) an individual's mental response to the cosmic intelligence of Cosmic

Mind.</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Author Michael Talbot, who has popularized the concept of the "holographic

universe," explains how many researchers now believe that the miraculous

appearances of Virgin Mary are "hologram-like projections" created by the

collective beliefs of the human race. These observations echo the yogic

idea that ghosts are hallucinatory creations of a concentrated and fearful

mind. These "ectoplasmic creations ' are so "real" that they can even be

photographed. And, in fact, Talbot writes that photographic reproductions

of many of these apparitions do exist. Consequently people believe that

they are manifestations of the Virgin Mary Herself. Talbot also reports

that many scientists now believe that a large percentage of UFO sightings

and abductions are holographic creations of our subconscious minds. As

psychologist Carl Gustav Jung claimed, these extraterrestrial sightings

are elves and dragons in modern disguise. So if the human mind can create

such "holographic" visions in outer space, so to speak, it must also be

capable of creating them in inner space, within the mind itself, and then

communicate with them as if the visions or voices are real and are coming

from somewhere or someone else. Some channelers' experiences may therefore

be explained as hologram-like visions within the mind.</font>

<H3 align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

Dreams</font></H3>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

In a sense, all spiritual people are more or less channeling Cosmic Mind

or God. But when we try to communicate our experiences and our insights,

most of us are either speechless or at least humble enough to speak with

our own, individual and interpretative voice. Most of us do not speak on

behalf of Ramtha, Michael, St. Germaine, Hitler, or Aunt Bessie, nor on

behalf of God or Brahma. We take full responsibility for our own statements,

and we interpret our visions just like a dreamer does. So why do not channelers

do the same?</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Yes, why does a channeler insist he or she is contacting a "real" outside

source, or is being talked to by a "real" someone else? Simply because

they are deceived to believe they are talking to someone else. Our mind,

unless saturated with the non-dual state of bliss, is in a perpetual state

of dualism, a feeling of "subject" and "object," "I" and "that". Consequently,

when the mind is seeing or hearing something which appears to have entered

its own silent domain, it seems to have been created by something "other

than I," something originating from an external source.</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Paul Brunton, an eloquent observer of spiritual phenomena, and in particular

mediumship, channeling, and the occult, says that "the mystic is too close

to his experience, too enthralled with its wonder, to notice how far he

is himself contributing a genuine... or even a fictitious element to it,

or to comprehend that it is the act of meditation itself... The nugget

of inspirational gold is hidden within a fantasy created by his own desires

and emotions, by his strong wishful thinking. It is a more refined version

of the old story of making God partly but not wholly in man's image."</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Thus channeling experiences do not really originate from an outside

source. They are caused by mental pictures that are brought up from the

subconscious or super-conscious mind and reflected onto the conscious mind—even

when the visions are conceived to be of something external. The messages

he or she hears are only the echo of his or her own voice, a subtle psychic

self-deception.</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">If a channeler believes that the source is foreign, that it belongs

to someone who lived 35,000 years ago, then that internal, mythical image

becomes, when told to others, a mythology, a socially accepted fantasy.

The more people believe in this fantasy, the more real it becomes to both

the channeler and his or her clients. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy

which of course mutually benefits both parties.</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">To yield to the temptations of these psychic expressions—whether it

is a voice, an image, a vision, or a command—is not the goal of meditation.

A yogi will attempt to pierce through this layer with the help of his or

her inner discrimination and detachment in order to reach a higher realm

of super-consciousness. But that is not always the case. The channeling

frenzy, or the popular adventures in the channeling zone, confirms the

difficulty many have in cultivating spiritual qualities as opposed to psychic

ones. It is easy for many to yield to the temptations of having extraordinary,

psychic experiences rather than to follow the perennial advise of all authentic,

spiritual teachers: to nurture sustained spiritual transcendence, humbleness,

service-mindedness, love, and moral integrity.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

The use of religious deities may help shed some light on the process of

channeling. The ancient religious Gods and Goddesses, such as Kali or Ganesha,

arose through a process of giving external form to abstract ideas. A mystic

may have conceived of a certain idea or reached a certain state of mind,

and to make that concept better understood psychologically, an image was

invented. When that mythological or psychological image becomes part of

the social culture, it shapes people's collective psychology or mythology.

Thus people start worshipping these images, and through their worship they

may gain certain psycho-spiritual experiences, or they may dogmatically

believe that these Gods and Goddesses are "real."</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Whether mental images are channeled or have originated from a religious

archetype, these experiences are still "authentic" in a psychic sense.

But the images or voices do not belong to a person's soul who existed in

a human body a few or many thousand years ago. Even though the channeled

image may transmit deep wisdom about spiritual matters, or knowledge about

a client's personality or past, the source of the material is the channeler

or the religious person's own mind.</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">In the words of Paul Brunton: "Mystical experiences do happen and only

the materialist, who will not trouble to investigate, dares deny their

occurrence. But when each mystic tells of seeing only that God or that

savior or that Guide whom he already worship or honors, the thoughtful

scientific inquirer naturally and rightly becomes suspicious."</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">In other words, a Christian may see Mother Mary or Jesus or pictures

of the orthodox heaven, a Hindu may see Kali or Shiva. If the heart yearns

intensely for the impersonal Brahma or God, but—whether through environmental

suggestion or historical tradition—associates this goal with a particular

mental image, there will undoubtedly be an unconscious projection of the

image into one's mystical experiences.</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Meditative images are also consciously used in yoga, for example, to

focus the mind in order to yield a certain spiritual result. But these

images are tools and keys by which the aspirant opens the door to higher

states of consciousness. They are not those states, nor do they exist outside

the mind. They are to be reverently embraced in the heart and mind of the

meditator as bridges to reach a transcendental state of mind.</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">The goal of all truly authentic spiritual paths, is to establish a personal

relationship between ourselves and Cosmic Consciousness or God. Because

the whole universe is soaked in Consciousness, indeed there is nothing

but Consciousness. Hence all things can be communed with as if they are

conscious, even emotions and visions, because everything is a manifestation

of that Ultimate Consciousness. This communion is thus a means of becoming

one with one's own innermost self—not, as in channeling, to establish a

dualistic relationship to some disembodied entity said to exist outside

of oneself. Because ultimately, nothing exists outside or apart from our

own true nature—nothing is apart from our own enlightened Self. Because

that enlightened Self is nothing but Infinite Consciousness or God.</font>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">

It is of course quite likely that channelers hear voices, even a voice

that resembles someone else's. But according to yoga, what seems real to

the mind, is only a proximation or metaphor of the ultimate, spiritual

truth. To receive information of past or present, the mind may need a vehicle,

a voice or an image. The fact that such a vehicle is being witnessed by

the mind does not mean that it comes from somewhere else than within that

individual mind itself. In that sense, channeling is a form of self-deception

or internal apparition.</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">The spoken voice the channeler hears is only a metaphorical vehicle

used to produce the desired result, namely to receive messages from the

unconscious or super-conscious mind. Hence we have entered a subtle and

powerful but deceptive mental universe, in which the channeler hears a

voice resembling another personality (a relative, a guru, God, Jesus, etc.)

and automatically believes that the voice originates from that "real" personality.</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">But as Paul Brunton explains: During channeling "there are both an impersonal

and a personal" aspect of the messages. "The first is derived from his

higher self, which is often mistaken for God [or Guru]. The second is derived

from his own characteristic mentality, whose contribution is seldom recognized

or admitted. The essential idea comes from a higher source but the words

expressing it do not."</font>



<P align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Hence the words in the channeler's mind are the audible echoes of his

or her own mental panorama. These Divine Talk Show Hosts are simply hearing

their own "lower" or "higher" mind speaking to itself.</font>
