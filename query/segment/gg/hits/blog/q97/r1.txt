After ruling morning television for 28 years as New York's Everyman-about-town, the co-host who made performance art of TV gab is exiting what for a decade has been known as "Live! With Regis and Kelly." His last day is Nov. 18. (AP Photo/Charles Sykes)    NEW YORK, N.Y. - Regis Philbin says his fans tell him he made them happy every morning. But his decades of regular visits with viewers end Friday, when he steps down from the show he co-hosted for 28 years. He told reporters after Thursday's edition of "Live! With Regis and Kelly" he feels "pretty good." But he notes he may not feel that good next week. After Friday's sign-off, the 80-year-old Philbin will embark on a book tour for his new memoir, "How I Got This Way." He says that's fortunate: It'll take his mind off how he'd feel Monday when "Live! With Kelly" goes on the air without him. Jerry Seinfeld will join Kelly Ripa on Monday as the first of her series of guest co-hosts. A permanent replacement will be named later.
