Welcome to the channeling zone. The TV screen yields an image of a fancy hotel ballroom somewhere in California. A famous channeler sits on a large wicker throne. She is dressed in a long white gown and graciously moves her slender fingers with polished nails while she speaks. She is obviously in some kind of trance while answering questions from the audience, many of whom are Hollywood celebrities. She then walks down through the audience while talking to people at random, giving advice, cracking jokes, all the while conversing with a voice seemingly not her own.  From Los Angeles to New York City to Europe and beyond, these kinds of channeled seances have become an increasingly popular New Age phenomenon. Some of the channelers are rich and famous and draw large audiences, others have smaller yet extremely devoted followers. But they all claim to speak on behalf of bodiless spirits—wise men and women from earth or from other planets. One is speaking on behalf of Jesus, another is claiming to channel a well known Indian guru, and yet others amplify the voices of various personalities who, they claim, lived thousands of years ago.  These channelers—who converse so effortlessly with angels, aliens, "ascended masters" and gurus—are dismissed as charlatans by intellectuals and are cursed by Christians as being the couriers of the Devil, others fear that the phenomenon signals the precursor of another dark age of irrationality. But the reality is probably more mundane: channeling has deep roots in the Western notions of individualism and self-perfection. Having abandoned mainstream religions for their lack of mysticism, joy, freedom of inquiry and celebration, many are today seeking spiritual solace in an improvisational realm of spirits and a potpourri of psychological and religious ideas. Other traits of those flocking to the channeling zone are: deep distrust for authority, morality and tradition, fear of the future, and, somewhat ironically, an unquestioning passion for anything out of the ordinary.  About 20 physicists, sociologists, and psychologists recently convened to study the famous channeler described above. She claims to receive messages from a 35,000 year old being dressed in flowing garments of light. Through biofeedback and an array of rigorous psychological tests, the panel of experts concluded that she did not fake her experiences, and that something "unusual" occurs when she enters her trance. But when determining the exact source of her information, their opinions differed greatly.  Does the channeled being exist in a metaphysical realm apart from her mind? Is he a mythical figure of her own imagination? Is he a manifestation of her higher self or consciousness? Or is the channeler simply schizophrenic? The most compelling conclusion came from best-selling author and Jungian analyst Thomas Moore. He determined that her "channeling was not part of her [conscious] mind, not multiple personality disorder, but... coming from the super-conscious mind."  The Yogic Mind  Let us analyze this statement from the perspective of yoga. In yoga psychology, the mind consists of five basic layers, which are as follows: Conscious mind. This mental stage has three functions: a) sensing external stimuli from the outside world through the sensory organs, b) having desires on the basis of those stimuli, c) acting to materialize those desires.  Subconscious or subtle mind. This mental stage has four functions: a) memory, b) contemplation, c) experience of pleasure and pain, d) dreaming.  Supramental or first layer of what psychologist Moore called the super-conscious mind. This part of the mind has the capacity to transcend time, space and person and see into past, present, and future. It is the layer of deep intuition. In Jungian psychology, this is the collective unconscious or super-conscious mind.  Subliminal mind or the second layer of the super-conscious mind. In this stage discrimination and non-attachment are experienced, and one can discern between eternal truth and the "passing show" of the material world.  Subtle causal mind or third layer of the super-conscious mind. Also termed the "golden" layer as it signifies a state of pure bliss; only a thin veil separates the individual and infinite consciousness.    How and Where Channeling Takes Place  Using this ancient model of yogic psychology, we can establish that channeling takes place between the second or third layer and, if genuine wisdom is received, mostly in the third.  Why did psychologist Thomas Moore conclude that the channeler contacts her super-conscious mind and not a disembodied entity? Simply because it does not appear to be possible, neither psychologically nor spiritually. The mind, after dissociation from the physical body at death, until the time of rebirth is a "bodiless mind". For the performance of action and the perception of pleasure and pain, organs are necessary. In this state of "bodiless mind", the conscious and subconscious portions of mind are inactive and there is no experience of pleasure and pain. Since the bodiless mind can experience or do nothing until its rebirth, attempts to contact or influence these bodiless minds would be futile. Thus, according to yoga, there is no heaven and hell and during death the mind is in a state of limbo. While in this void, it waits until it is time to be reborn in an environment in which the momentum of its past lives can be expressed.  The Holographic Mind   But if death is an expressionless sleep, when the mind is completely detached from the body, then how do we explain so-called near death experiences (NDE's)?  While a person in a NDE may be clinically dead, his or her mind is still functioning as it maintains a "weak connection" or parallelism with the body. In this unconscious state, literally between life and death, a person may have many dreamlike experiences. People who leave their bodies after being diagnosed as clinically dead, have—after returning back to life—reported seeing and communicating with "higher beings of light" or "vast libraries of knowledge." But when these experiences have been analyzed, the libraries they have seen can better be described as pictorial representations of Cosmic Knowledge. These libraries or higher beings do not really exist, rather they represent the way an individual translates the incoming knowledge or wisdom from Cosmic Mind in a "holographic" fashion. In other words, the libraries were "literally built out of knowledge."  University of London physicist David Bohm, one of the world's most respected quantum physicists, and Stanford neurophysiologist Karl Pribram, one of the architects of our modern understanding of the brain, believe that the universe itself may be a giant hologram, quite literally a kind of image or construct created, at least in part, by the human mind. Yes, only in part by the human mind, because Cosmic Mind is the real creator of the universe, and the human mind interprets or experiences what Cosmic Mind creates. Consequently, one can assert that the cause of internal visions and voices are of two kinds: (1) Psychic projections by an individual, or (2) an individual's mental response to the cosmic intelligence of Cosmic Mind.  Author Michael Talbot, who has popularized the concept of the "holographic universe," explains how many researchers now believe that the miraculous appearances of Virgin Mary are "hologram-like projections" created by the collective beliefs of the human race. These observations echo the yogic idea that ghosts are hallucinatory creations of a concentrated and fearful mind. These "ectoplasmic creations ' are so "real" that they can even be photographed. And, in fact, Talbot writes that photographic reproductions of many of these apparitions do exist. Consequently people believe that they are manifestations of the Virgin Mary Herself. Talbot also reports that many scientists now believe that a large percentage of UFO sightings and abductions are holographic creations of our subconscious minds. As psychologist Carl Gustav Jung claimed, these extraterrestrial sightings are elves and dragons in modern disguise. So if the human mind can create such "holographic" visions in outer space, so to speak, it must also be capable of creating them in inner space, within the mind itself, and then communicate with them as if the visions or voices are real and are coming from somewhere or someone else. Some channelers' experiences may therefore be explained as hologram-like visions within the mind.  Dreams  In a sense, all spiritual people are more or less channeling Cosmic Mind or God. But when we try to communicate our experiences and our insights, most of us are either speechless or at least humble enough to speak with our own, individual and interpretative voice. Most of us do not speak on behalf of Ramtha, Michael, St. Germaine, Hitler, or Aunt Bessie, nor on behalf of God or Brahma. We take full responsibility for our own statements, and we interpret our visions just like a dreamer does. So why do not channelers do the same?  Yes, why does a channeler insist he or she is contacting a "real" outside source, or is being talked to by a "real" someone else? Simply because they are deceived to believe they are talking to someone else. Our mind, unless saturated with the non-dual state of bliss, is in a perpetual state of dualism, a feeling of "subject" and "object," "I" and "that". Consequently, when the mind is seeing or hearing something which appears to have entered its own silent domain, it seems to have been created by something "other than I," something originating from an external source.  Paul Brunton, an eloquent observer of spiritual phenomena, and in particular mediumship, channeling, and the occult, says that "the mystic is too close to his experience, too enthralled with its wonder, to notice how far he is himself contributing a genuine... or even a fictitious element to it, or to comprehend that it is the act of meditation itself... The nugget of inspirational gold is hidden within a fantasy created by his own desires and emotions, by his strong wishful thinking. It is a more refined version of the old story of making God partly but not wholly in man's image."  Thus channeling experiences do not really originate from an outside source. They are caused by mental pictures that are brought up from the subconscious or super-conscious mind and reflected onto the conscious mind—even when the visions are conceived to be of something external. The messages he or she hears are only the echo of his or her own voice, a subtle psychic self-deception.  If a channeler believes that the source is foreign, that it belongs to someone who lived 35,000 years ago, then that internal, mythical image becomes, when told to others, a mythology, a socially accepted fantasy. The more people believe in this fantasy, the more real it becomes to both the channeler and his or her clients. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy which of course mutually benefits both parties.  To yield to the temptations of these psychic expressions—whether it is a voice, an image, a vision, or a command—is not the goal of meditation. A yogi will attempt to pierce through this layer with the help of his or her inner discrimination and detachment in order to reach a higher realm of super-consciousness. But that is not always the case. The channeling frenzy, or the popular adventures in the channeling zone, confirms the difficulty many have in cultivating spiritual qualities as opposed to psychic ones. It is easy for many to yield to the temptations of having extraordinary, psychic experiences rather than to follow the perennial advise of all authentic, spiritual teachers: to nurture sustained spiritual transcendence, humbleness, service-mindedness, love, and moral integrity.  Mystical Imagery  The use of religious deities may help shed some light on the process of channeling. The ancient religious Gods and Goddesses, such as Kali or Ganesha, arose through a process of giving external form to abstract ideas. A mystic may have conceived of a certain idea or reached a certain state of mind, and to make that concept better understood psychologically, an image was invented. When that mythological or psychological image becomes part of the social culture, it shapes people's collective psychology or mythology. Thus people start worshipping these images, and through their worship they may gain certain psycho-spiritual experiences, or they may dogmatically believe that these Gods and Goddesses are "real."  Whether mental images are channeled or have originated from a religious archetype, these experiences are still "authentic" in a psychic sense. But the images or voices do not belong to a person's soul who existed in a human body a few or many thousand years ago. Even though the channeled image may transmit deep wisdom about spiritual matters, or knowledge about a client's personality or past, the source of the material is the channeler or the religious person's own mind.  In the words of Paul Brunton: "Mystical experiences do happen and only the materialist, who will not trouble to investigate, dares deny their occurrence. But when each mystic tells of seeing only that God or that savior or that Guide whom he already worship or honors, the thoughtful scientific inquirer naturally and rightly becomes suspicious."  In other words, a Christian may see Mother Mary or Jesus or pictures of the orthodox heaven, a Hindu may see Kali or Shiva. If the heart yearns intensely for the impersonal Brahma or God, but—whether through environmental suggestion or historical tradition—associates this goal with a particular mental image, there will undoubtedly be an unconscious projection of the image into one's mystical experiences.  Meditative images are also consciously used in yoga, for example, to focus the mind in order to yield a certain spiritual result. But these images are tools and keys by which the aspirant opens the door to higher states of consciousness. They are not those states, nor do they exist outside the mind. They are to be reverently embraced in the heart and mind of the meditator as bridges to reach a transcendental state of mind.  The goal of all truly authentic spiritual paths, is to establish a personal relationship between ourselves and Cosmic Consciousness or God. Because the whole universe is soaked in Consciousness, indeed there is nothing but Consciousness. Hence all things can be communed with as if they are conscious, even emotions and visions, because everything is a manifestation of that Ultimate Consciousness. This communion is thus a means of becoming one with one's own innermost self—not, as in channeling, to establish a dualistic relationship to some disembodied entity said to exist outside of oneself. Because ultimately, nothing exists outside or apart from our own true nature—nothing is apart from our own enlightened Self. Because that enlightened Self is nothing but Infinite Consciousness or God.  Piercing the Cloud of Mystical Visions  It is of course quite likely that channelers hear voices, even a voice that resembles someone else's. But according to yoga, what seems real to the mind, is only a proximation or metaphor of the ultimate, spiritual truth. To receive information of past or present, the mind may need a vehicle, a voice or an image. The fact that such a vehicle is being witnessed by the mind does not mean that it comes from somewhere else than within that individual mind itself. In that sense, channeling is a form of self-deception or internal apparition.  The spoken voice the channeler hears is only a metaphorical vehicle used to produce the desired result, namely to receive messages from the unconscious or super-conscious mind. Hence we have entered a subtle and powerful but deceptive mental universe, in which the channeler hears a voice resembling another personality (a relative, a guru, God, Jesus, etc.) and automatically believes that the voice originates from that "real" personality.  But as Paul Brunton explains: During channeling "there are both an impersonal and a personal" aspect of the messages. "The first is derived from his higher self, which is often mistaken for God [or Guru]. The second is derived from his own characteristic mentality, whose contribution is seldom recognized or admitted. The essential idea comes from a higher source but the words expressing it do not."  Hence the words in the channeler's mind are the audible echoes of his or her own mental panorama. These Divine Talk Show Hosts are simply hearing their own "lower" or "higher" mind speaking to itself.   Roar Bjonnes has practiced Tantra Yoga for the past 23 years.
