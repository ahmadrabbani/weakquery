The law will be applied from the beginning of 2012. “We are going ahead with the program aimed at restricting jobs at lingerie shops to women, mostly Saudis,” said Assistant Deputy Minister for Development Ali Al-Tukhaify. He said those who violate the law in this respect would be punished. Speaking at a workshop organized by Asharqia Chamber, he said a royal decree had been issued authorizing the ministry to set out necessary rules for regulating women’s work and provide financial and administrative support to train women for jobs. He said three parties — related government departments, businessmen and women workers — should cooperate to make the program effective and successful. The program covers shops selling lingerie and women’s cosmetics and accessories. “Jobs in shops selling lingerie and other women’s accessories will be restricted to women and Saudized during 2012,” the minister said, adding that the program would be implemented at independent shops as well as those in shopping centers and open markets. “If the shop is totally for women at least three Saudi saleswomen should be employed there and men will not be allowed in. They work like women’s tailoring shops or beauty centers,” Al-Tukhaify said. It is up to the owner to make a shop exclusively for women or have a separate women’s section. He said women-only shops should have advanced security systems. Investors should also provide suitable toilets for women inside the shopping center. He also pointed out that women working at these shops should be modestly dressed or wear special uniforms if the owner wanted them to do so. With regard to working hours, the minister said the owner should reach an agreement with workers for full-time or part-time work, which should be based on a work contract, ensuring rights of all parties. Owners can make use of a model contract that would be made available on the ministry’s website. Al-Tukhaify said his ministry would provide employment support for the program for three years. “We’ll punish those who violate laws related to employment of women, Saudization and work contract by denying them new visas, preventing transfer of sponsorship and change of profession,” he explained.
