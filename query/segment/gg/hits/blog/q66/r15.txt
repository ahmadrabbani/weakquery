 Islam and Women

  Islam and Women    I could not remain a Muslim because Islam hates women.  I think I always knew this, but as I got older that knowledge became more acute, Islam wants women to cover themselves, to stay indoors, to obey men, however stupid those men are.  Islam says that women are inferior in every way.  Islam distorted my father�s feelings.  He did not want us, his own daughters, to be happy or fulfilled.  He only wanted us to be good Muslims and for daughters this means to be suffering Muslims.  What sort of religion forces fathers to make their daughters suffer?  What sort of father thinks that his daughter�s hair is shameful?  What sort of father tells her she cannot sing and dance when she is happy?  A Muslim father.      This is why I am not a Muslim.  My children, boys and girls, will be able to feel the wind in their hair.  They will not be ashamed.  They can sing and dance as much as they like.  Nothing they do will shame me, as long as it is done with life and joy.  Islam has no joy.  Islam is a cult of tears and death   .  Testimony submitted to the web site of the  Institute for the Secularization of Islamic Society   A man is never alone with a woman without Satan also being present   .   Hadith Al-Albani, Sahih al-Jami, vol. 1, p. 234.]           Western Muslim's Racist Race Spree (frontpagemag.com 12/27/05)        The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property,  either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, must delay the final extinction of slavery  until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.  Sir Winston Churchill, The River War, Vol. II, pp. 248-50, London: Longman, Green & Co., 1899)     Movie about the Violent Oppression of Women in Islam       On this web page, I discuss the Islamic attitude toward women.  This attitude can be divided into the Islamic attitude toward infidel women and the Islamic attitude toward Islamic women.  I start with what Islamic sources say and then give examples of how this is being put into practice in modern times.  It is important to keep in mind that not all Muslims think alike, and that there are Muslims who are respectful of both infidel and Moslem women.  In a frontpagemagazine symposium (Gender Apartheid and Islam, 12/30/04) Ali Sina argued with two apologists for Islam's teachings on women, Ms. Julia Roach and Mohammad El Mallah.  Mr. Sina said:   Let us see what the Quran says about women. It says  �men have a degree (of advantage) over them�     2:228 ; that the witness of woman is worth half of that of man  2:282 ; that women inherit half of their male siblings,  4:11-12 ; that a man can marry two or three or four women  4:3 ; that if a women becomes captive in a war, her Muslim master is allowed to rape her  33:50 ; that if a woman is not totally submissive to her husband she will enter Hell  66:10 ;   that women are �tilth� for their husbands (to cultivate them)   2:223 ; that men are in charge of women, as if women were imbeciles or minors who could not take care of themselves; that they must be obedient to their husbands or be admonished (verbally abused), banished from the bed (psychologically abused) and beaten (physically abused)  4:34 .          These verses define the station of women in Islam...      Ms. Roach laments that Islam is not practiced in all parts of the world by all Muslims to the standard prescribed by Allah in the Qur�an.         For that we should give thanks to God. Imagine if all Muslims were to stone or hang victims of rape or flog women for minor offenses such as exposing a flock of hair. In fact, the countries that practice Islam to its fullest are truly barbaric. Just think of the suffering of the women in Afghanistan during the rule of the Taliban. Women were not allowed to go out of their homes or work. Male doctors were not allowed to visit female patients. So, when women became sick, there was no one to take care of them and they died. The more a country becomes Islamic the more hellish it gets.         Ms. Roach comforts herself by thinking that after women die they can expect to be treated equally and says �Women's souls have equal value to those of Men's�. In other words, what she is saying is that while women live a life of slavery, abuse and deprivation in this world they can rejoice because after they die they will be treated equally. Although I find this a vacuous bargain, the truth is that even this promise is not true. Women in Islam are not treated equally even in death.         Men are promised many virgins after they die. What do women get? They get their old lousy husband to share with 72 voluptuous celestial virgins. With that many high-bosomed houries why would any man want to spend a night with an old wife? Do women get also young celestial studs to have orgies with? No they don�t. They have to maintain their �modesty� even after their death. The truth is that in Islam men and women are not treated equally even after their death.         In fact, according to Muhammad few women ever make it to Paradise . The majority of them end up in Hell. Let us see what the Prophet says in this regards. This is where he describes his hallucinatory visit to hell and paradise:         "Then I saw the (Hell) Fire, and I have never before, seen such a horrible sight as that, and I saw that the majority of its dwellers were women." The people asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What is the reason for that?" He replied, "Because of their ungratefulness." It was said. "Do they disbelieve in Allah (are they ungrateful to Allah)?" He replied, "They are not thankful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favors done to them. Even if you do good to one of them all your life, when she seems some harshness from you, she will say, "I have never seen any good from you.' "    Bukhari 7.62.125...   She [Ms. Roach] also claims that a Muslim woman has the right to sexual satisfaction within her marriage and clarified that �if a woman is unsatisfied she can obtain a divorce�. Is that true? Under the Sharia women are not allowed to divorce even if their husband beats them. The decision to divorce rest only on man's whims. Now imagine a women going to a Judge demanding divorce accusing her husband of impotency. How can you humiliate the gigantic ego of a Muslim man and expect to live after that? She will be a dead woman the next day. If she survives and manages to divorce, she will be seen as a whore by everyone. A divorced woman has nowhere to go in the Islamic world. I do not know whether Ms. Roach has ever lived in an Islamic country. Muslim women are not allowed to have any libido. It is not pious for women to have sexual feelings. In fact the genital mutilation is designed to take away any sexual pleasure from them. Women are not supposed to enjoy sex. If they have any libido, there is a risk that they may fornicate and commit sin. Women must only provide satisfaction to their husbands and deny all their own sexual needs. According to a tradition:        Allah's Apostle said, "If a husband calls his wife to his bed (i.e. to have sexual relation) and she refuses and causes him to sleep in anger, the angels will curse her till  morning."     Bukhari 4.54.450         It is hilarious to think that the angels have nothing better to do than sit around and curse the poor woman all the night for depriving them from watching the live porno show.  If Allah must punish woman for not satisfying the sexual needs of their husbands why does he needs angels to lobby him for it? Isn�t it a waste of angel�s resources?         In one sense this is all truly very funny. But in another, much larger sense, it is a tragedy. ..     I think it is worth mentioning that in Saudi Arabia if a person has been killed or caused to die by another, the latter has to pay blood money or compensation, as follows:    100,000 riyals if the victim is a Muslim man 50,000 riyals if a Muslim woman 50,000 riyals if a Christian man 25,000 riyals if a Christian woman 6,666 riyals if a Hindu man 3,333 riyals if a Hindu woman      Source: The Wall Street Journal, April 9, 2002    So as you see people's worth are not the same in Islam. It depends on their gender and their religion.      In the Koran (4.34) it is written:   Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women). So good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded. As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart; and scourge (beat) them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them Lo! Allah is ever High Exalted, Great.       In addition to the Koran, Mohammed's teachings are included in the Hadith.  Next to the Koran, is is the most important part of Islamic law, its teachings are just as binding.  The following quotes from the Hadith are from the "Sahih Al-Bukhari".  In volume 3:826 of Sahih Al-Bukhari Muhammed is quoted as explaining why a witness of a woman is equal to half that of a man.  He said    This is because of the deficiency of the woman's mind.       This argument was  caught on tape in Birmingham�s Green Lane Mosque.       �Allah has created the woman � even if she gets a Ph.D. � deficient. Her intellect is incomplete, deficient. She may be suffering from hormones that will make her emotional. It takes two witnesses of a woman to equal the one witness of the man.�             Mohammed also quoted as saying that:    I was shown the Hell-fire and the majority of its dwellers are women 1:28,301;2:161,7:124   and that:   I have not left any affliction more harmful to men than women 7:33     The Koran commands men to beat women who are disobedient.  Sura 4:34 of the Koran says,    �Men are the managers of the affairs of women . . . Those women who are rebellious � admonish them, banish them to their couches, and beat them.�      In Tirmzi P439 we find:   If a woman's conduct is mischievous or immodest, the husband has the right to beat her up (Tirmzi P439)      These religious commands of Islam help us understand why Mohamed Kamal Mustafa, A prominent Muslim preacher from Italy authored a book Women in Islam, in which he wrote that verbal warnings followed by a period of sexual inactivity can be used to discipline a disobedient wife.   If that failed he said that according to Islamic law, beatings could be then judiciously administered.  "The blows should be concentrated on the hands and feet using a rod that is thin and light so that it does not leave scars or bruises on the body."        These commands also help us understand a Muslim web site titled  How To Beat A Wife (5/1/05).      More Islamic commands in regard to women are listed below.   It is forbidden for a woman to be seen by any man except her husband when she is made up or well-dressed. (Tirmzi P 430)     A woman is not a believer if she undertakes a journey which may last three days or longer, unless she is accompanied by her husband, son, father  A woman must veil herself even in the presence of her husband's father, brother and other male relations. (Tirmzi P 432)  She is forbidden to spend any money without the permission of her husband, and it includes giving food to the needy or feast to friends. (Tirmzi P 265)  A wife is forbidden to perform extra prayers (NAFAL) or observe fasting (other than RAMADAN) without the permission of her husband. (Tirmzi P 300)  If prostration were a legitimate act other than to God, woman should have prostrated to her husband. (Tirmzi P 42  If a man is in a mood to have sexual intercourse the woman must come immediately even if she is baking bread at a communal oven. (Tirmzi P 42  A woman who seeks KHULA i.e. divorce from her man, without a just cause, shall not enter paradise. (Tirmzi P 440) A husband can divorce his wife at will.  Majority of women would go to hell. (Muslim P 1431)  If a woman refuses to come to bed when invited by her husband, she becomes the target of the curses of angels. Exactly the same happens if she deserts her husband's bed. (Bukhari P 93)     A woman in many ways is deprived of the possession of her own body. Even her milk belongs to her husband. (Bukhari P 27)  She is not allowed to practise birth control either.      Ibn Masud reported, "We were fighting with the Messenger of Allah, and our wives were not with us. We asked the Messenger of Allah, 'Should we castrate ourselves?' The Holy Prophet forbade us from that, and then he allowed us Muta (temporary) marriage. So, we all married wives for a fixed time (usually three days) for the dowry of a piece of cloth." (Al Hadis, Vol. 2, p. 686)    Here Mohammed clearly tells the Muslims to forget about the prostitutes they had purchased for a handful of dates back home and to have fun with these new victims who come even cheaper. They can be bought and violated for only a piece of cloth. Allah is truly merciful! Praise be to Allah!      For more quotes about women and other aspects of Islam see  The Incredible Teachings of Muhammed .     The reasons that the beauty of women needs to be suppressed are explained in  A book [Document No. 47] published by the Institute of Islamic and  Arabic Sciences in America, formerly an outpost of the state-financed and controlled  Imam Muhammed Ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh, copies of which were collected  from Al-Islam Mosque in Washington, D.C., which states ( Saudi Publications on Hate Ideology Fill American Mosques ):  �Among the more significant illustrations of imitating (the unbelievers), and the most dangerous for Muslims, is the enchantment of women. And this is among the traits of the unbelievers. The intent of this is to bring (them) out of their nature, veil, and modesty so that they could use it to tempt men�. Because women desire the glamour of the materialistic life, they are inclined to imitate, accommodate, and exaggerate in all of this, because women were built to seduce and beautify themselves for men. And men were built to desire a woman when she exposes (herself), and not to desire her when she is modest and covering.� [Document No. 47] The book adds that, if Muslim women unveil themselves, the whole Muslim community will be in peril:   �If they (Muslim women) leave the principle of modesty and cover, this will be the road and the way to discord (fitna), and in most cases if the Muslim nation falls into this trend it will lose its religion and worldly life.� [Document No. 47]         Australia�s most senior Muslim cleric, Sheik Hilali   in a religious address on adultery to about 500 worshippers in Sydney said:      "If you take out uncovered meat and place it outside on the street, or in the garden or in the park, or in the backyard without a cover, and the cats come and eat it ... whose fault is it, the cats or the uncovered meat?       "The uncovered meat is the problem.  If she was in her room, in her home, in her hijab, no problem would have occurred."      He said women were "weapons" used by "Satan" to control men.      "It is said in the state of zina (adultery), the responsibility falls 90 per cent of the time on the woman. Why? Because she possesses the weapon of enticement (igraa)."      A lot of Australian Muslims were outraged by his remarks.  ( The Australian 10/26/06 ).  Robert Spencer wrote in Frontpagemagazine that:             It was also somewhat surprising that Al-Hilali�s remarks generated any uproar at all. After all, the idea that a woman is responsible if she is raped did not originate with him, and this was not the first time it has been enunciated in the West. One notorious example occurred in September 2004 in Denmark, when the mufti Shahid Mehdi of the Islamic Cultural Center in Copenhagen  said on the Danish television program Talk to Gode that women who venture outside without a hijab are �asking for rape.�             Saudi columnist Fatima Al-Faqih examined the question of discrimination against women.  She wrote in the Saudi daily Al-Watan :        "Are Saudi women actually deprived [of their rights]? [They] are forbidden to drive, forbidden to travel without permission, forbidden to stay alone at a hotel without permission, forbidden to name their own children without [a man's] consent... forbidden to take out a passport without permission... forbidden to leave their homes without permission... forbidden to take a job without permission... forbidden to change the color of their abayas, forbidden to go to school or to the university without permission... forbidden to purchase shares or to open to a [bank] account in their children's name without permission.       "[A woman] is not allowed to expose her face in some cities of the kingdom... [She] is not allowed to marry without permission... not allowed to stay married if [one of] her male relatives decides that her husband's [tribal] lineage is inferior to hers... not allowed to sue for divorce without apologizing and paying a fine, not allowed to keep her children after the divorce, unless she gets permission... not allowed to hold a senior position in the private or public sectors, not allowed to vote or run for office... not allowed to travel alone with a chauffeur... not allowed to annoy her husband, and finally, a woman's voice is considered [a form of] defilement, and she is forbidden to speak in public, so that her affairs will remain shrouded in secrecy.       "A researcher [studying the limitations on women] would [probably] stop here, since the list is endless�      ���  Laurent Murawiec wrote about Saudi women and driving in his book Princes of Darkness as follows:     The unprecedented boldness of forty-seven Saudi women from good families, who took it into their heads, during the period when American troop strength in Saudi Arabia was growing, before the active phase of the 1991 Gulf War, to take the wheel of a car with the ubiquitous guardian in the passenger seat, were appropriately punished. �  These sluts, as the Grand Mufti, the priceless Bin Baz, called them, were arrested. �  The language used to denounce them was eloquent: �Whores and prostittutes,� �advocates of vice,� �filthy secularists,� said the fundamentalist sheikhs. �        ���    Columnist Dr. Maha Al-Hujailan criticized the norms of Saudi society, where a woman must live in constant fear that her husband may take another wife.      According to frontpagemag.com (8/12/04)   The Arab-Islamic world represses and demonizes women and female sexuality � and myriad other pleasures that come with life... The entire culture is based on subjugating the individual, whereas America represents the exact opposite.      J.Lo, Mariah Carey and Britney Spears doing what they do on American television is a major threat to this culture. It is freedom, and freedom of the female on every level. The Arab-Islamic world must wage war on the culture that produces this temptation because it cannot allow itself to succumb to the love of life, appreciation of pleasure and the allowance of women doing what they want with their lives -- and with their sexuality. It cannot allow the exercise of free will by individuals engaged in the pursuit of personal happiness.     Joel Mobray in an OPED called "Saudi Slavery in America" (New York Post 2/10/03) wrote that:   As part of its massive PR offensive, the House of Saud is trying to convince the world that its treatment of women is improving.  But a first hand witness would see a far different reality: Women locked inside homes, paid little or nothing as domestic servants, worked up to 20 hours per day, and verbally and physically abused.    And that's right here in America - in the homes of Saudis living in the United States...    Notes Keith Roiderick, president of the Coalition for the Defense of Human Rights, who personally helped a woman escape a Saudi home: "When you meet these women and hear their horror stories, it breaks your heart."   Joel Mobray also wrote that:   Tens of thousands of women are abused in Saudi Arabia each year.   The Saudi government admits that some 19,000 domestic servants - almost exclusively foreign women working in the kingdom as maids - escaped from Saudi homes in the 12 momths prior to March 2001. (The real figure is likely far higher...)      If you are a woman unfortunate enough to have had children with a Saudi Muslim and he decides to leave with the kids to Saudi Arabia, you have no rights when it comes to getting them back.  Pat Roush wrote a book about her experiences trying to bring her children back to America called  At Any Price . A  movie was made from Betty Mahmoudy's  book   both called "Not Without My Daughter" about her struggle to get her children out of Saudi Arabia.        If a man and woman are alone in a car together and are not married they will both be punished in Saudi Arabia.   Both were sentenced to 90 lashes after committing that terrible crime .       Sophia, a twenty two year old Pakistani woman of Muslim origin decided to leave Islam.  In her testimony (printed in  Leaving Islam , she wrote:     My first rebellion was against a culture that teaches me to be subservient, to accept social sexual harassment, and even to be killed.  I worked with an organization in Pakistan where I witnessed acid being thrown over women because they married men they chose or they left men they chose to leave.  Women were killed for disobeying, and thus dishonoring the family, beaten because they raised their voice against a man.  Yes, all these things are directly related to religion.  Islamic preachers will tell you all that is cultural and that Islam has played no role in this.  Coincidentally, this culture seems to repeat itself in almost every Muslim country from Asia to Africa.        On August 20 th 2006, a Pakistani woman living in Italy was murdered by her Muslim father probably because she had been promised in marriage to a cousin and refused to marry him.  ( Murder of Muslim girl rebel by her father shocks all Italy, The Independent, 8/20/2006 )         On the evening of Monday 9 October, Kaihana Hussain, the teenage daughter of Muslim immigrants, told her parents that she was converting from Islam to Christianity. ( Australia: Girl�s Conversion Results in Mother�s Death , 10/13/2006) Her father responded with unrestrained fury. Neighbours heard "blood curdling" and "terrifying" screams and cries of "Help me, help me, they're trying to kill me", but they were unsure which apartment the screams were coming from, and the voices were unfamiliar.    After a short time, Kaihana came running out of the family's apartment, dressed only in her underwear, her clothes torn off, blood splattered over her severely scratched and cut body.     All that is known at this stage is that after her father began to attack her, Kaihana's mother, Yasmin (41, and a strict and devout Muslim), intervened to aid and protect her daughter.     What police found when they entered the apartment was Yasmin bleeding severely from a fatal knife wound to the chest, and her husband, Kaihana's father, Dr Muhammad Hussain (49) also bleeding from a potentially fatal knife wound to the chest. Blood was splattered on walls, floors and doorways throughout the three-bedroom luxury apartment. Yasmin died at the scene and Dr Hussain is presently hospitalised in an induced coma, in a critical condition. Police have confirmed that Kaihana is not a suspect in their deaths.    A Muslim source said that:     "'From what we understand the daughter decided to tell her father of her radical plan to convert to Christianity which, in the eyes of most Muslims, is totally unacceptable and to be honest, sadly, many would react as he has done,' said the source.       "'It is the Islamic way that if a son or daughter does or plans to do something that is unacceptable or wrong for a Muslim then it is the mother who is automatically at fault and will bear the brunt of the blame."'           �  Muslims have brought honor killings to the West. �  Banaz Mahmod shown in the picture below:         ran away from home when she was a teenager but returned when her father sent her an audio tape in which he warned he would kill her sisters, her mother and himself if she did not come home, her sister said.      She was later hospitalized after her brother attacked her, the sister told the court. The brother said he had been paid by their father to finish her off but in the end was unable to do it. �  Her father and his brother accused the young woman of shaming her family by ending an abusive arranged marriage, becoming too Westernized and falling in love with a man who didn't come from their Iraqi village. �  She was found stuffed in a suitcase that was buried in the back garden. �  Her death is the latest in an increasing trend of such killings in Britain, home to some 1.8 million Muslims. More than 100 homicides are under investigation as potential "honor killings." ( fox news 6/11/07 ). �        Vasko Kohlmayer told the story of    Samaira     Nazir    who spurned the offer of a pre-arranged marriage to a man chosen for her in   Pakistan  , and dated another man, a Muslim also. �  Kohlmayer wrote ( frontpagemag 6/28/07 ):     Seized upon in her family home, she was violently attacked by her father, brother and cousin. Her screams alerted a neighbor who knocked on the door only to be told that the young woman was "having a fit." Some moments later, Nazir attempted to escape. She ran out of the house but her family members caught up with her on the entrance porch and pulled her back by the hair. As the door was being shut, witnesses outside saw her waving her bloodstained arms desperately. When the police finally arrived, they found her body slumped in a pool of blood with a scarf wound tightly around her neck through which three deep cuts had been made. In addition, Nazir�s body bore eighteen stab wounds inflicted with four different knives. The investigation revealed that she was held down by her own mother as her male kin went about their ghastly task. Nazir�s two cousins � girls aged two and four � were forced to watch to teach them what happens to a woman under Muslim law who refuses to abide by her family�s wishes.      ��  Stephen Brown wrote in  frontpage magazine 7/9/07 that:     It is estimated that 30,000 women among Germany�s 3.2 million Muslim population, of which 2.7 million are of Turkish origin, are subjected to forced marriages every year. Hundreds of young Muslim girls disappear annually from their German elementary and high schools to travel to their native Turkey and other Muslim countries, never to return.  Many are told they are going on holidays and do not realize they are to be married until after their arrival, after which their passports, jeans and freedom are taken away and  replaced with head scarves and confinement. Moreover, it is only on their wedding day that some see their husbands for the first time�          In many cases, the new wives live a slave-like existence for years in their new families, toiling long hours at housework under the rule of an oppressive mother-in-law, while suffering extensive physical and emotional abuse, sometimes from the day after their wedding, at the hands of their husbands. It is estimated that thousands, if not tens of thousands, of Muslim women in Germany endure daily such barbaric conditions.           Needless to say, freedom of movement, to come and go as they wish, also does not exist for the female newlyweds. Even Muslim girls who grew up in Germany and had enjoyed this basic right in their outwardly integrated families are now confined to the home of their new husbands and may not leave unless accompanied by a male�     �      many of the abused wives are threatened with death if they go to the police. And those who do flee are also potential murder victims, since leaving a traditional, patriarchal Muslim home carries a death sentence.        In Germany   the problem of domestic violence in Muslim homes is so bad that thirty per cent of the occupants in women�s shelters in German cities are Muslim ( frontpage magazine 6/26/07 ). And even there, these unfortunate women are not safe. Husbands and other male clan members, who can number up to 300, often set up round the clock surveillance of the shelter, in which the woman has sought refuge.    One young Muslim woman, who fled a planned forced marriage and is now living what the police term a �submarine existence� (she is in hiding), said her father told her when she was a child never to play with German girls because they were whores and that he would kill her if he ever caught her playing with boys. This �man of honor�, she says, has now threatened to pour gasoline over her and burn her to death if he ever finds her.         Ibn Warraq author of  Why I am not a Muslim has an online article called  Islam's Shame, Lifting the Veil of Tears , about the persecution of women under Islam.  Accidental Angel, an article in the March 2001 issue of Vogue magazine tells how in the summer of 2000, the Taliban, the Islamic Fundamentalist Government of Afghanistan arrested Mary MacKakin a 72 year old American Grandmother who was helping the widows of Afghanistan by giving them work.  When the Taliban came to power they forbid women to work.  One result was starving widows who had no man to support them.  When the Taliban came to power they also banned girls from school.   Women were allowed outside the house only to run errands and even then they had to be accompanied by a close male relative.  If a woman's hand was visible she risked a beating.  If a member of the Taliban decided he wanted to marry a woman, he could arrive at her house that day and announce his intention to marry her.  Resistance would not be an option.  Mary criticized the Taliban in the newsletter of her organization  PARSA and believes that is why she was arrested.  Anna Mulrine in her article "Unveiled Threat" U.S. News and World Report, Oct 5, 01, writes how:   In the two years between the Taliban's takeover of her hometown of Kabul and the death threat that forced her to flee her country, Laila watched women beaten with bicycle chains for "walking too fast."  She saw female friends sell off cherished possessions item by item until they became beggars and war widows forced into prostitution.  "You can't watch your children starve" she says, "So you leave your honor behind."  A former medical student Laila, 30, was confined to her home by a Taliban edict forbidding women to seek schooling or to walk outside without both a male escort and a burka, a head to toe covering broken only by finely woven netting at the eyes.  She began tutoring her neighbors' daughters, also banned from seeking an education.  It wasn't long before some 45 children a day were knocking on her door-and only a little longer before the Taliban discovered her underground school.  "They beat me in front of the children" she recalls from her new home in the United States," and told me that if I did one more thing against the Taliban, they would kill me."  Then they turned to the girls, cowering in the corners.  "They told them they would be burned alive if they ever returned to school again."       The above picture is of refugees trying to escape the Northern Alliance  assault on Kunduz on 11/22/01. They were fired on as they fled along the roads and donkey paths - by their former Taliban masters. (New York Post 11/23/01)     After the fall of the Taliban their remnants burned down or blew up more than a dozen schools for girls between late 2001 and 2003 (Rebuilt Girls School Burned Down Reuters 6/6/03).  On January 4, 2006 they beheaded a teacher, Abdul Habib for educating girls while forcing his wife and children to watch. ( Taliban Behead Teacher for Educating Girls , Fox News, 1/4/2006)        After the fall of the Taliban the editor of an Afghan women's rights magazine was jailed after a presidential adviser accused him of publishing un-Islamic material.  He wrote that leaving Islam was not a crime and criticized the practice of punishing adultery with 100 lashes. ( Afghan Editor Arrested for 'Un-Islamic' Writing , FoxNews.com 10/4/05)       Rage Against the Veil  is a scathing indictment of Islam's oppression of women. It tells the story of Dr. Homa Darabi, the first Iranian ever to be accepted into the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, who committed suicide in a crowded public square in Tehran in 1994 in order to bring awareness to the world of the slave conditions for women living in Iran.      A reviewer of the book for Amazon.com wrote:   I just read this book and wanted to write my review. Since I believe in God, I think Dr. Homa Darabi's act was ordained by God to bring the plight of the Muslim women to the world's attention. Growing up as a Muslim girl, my rights were constantly violated by my father, brothers and male cousins. What Parvin Darabi and Romin P. Thomson describe in Rage Against the Veil is a life lived by many women in the Islamic world. I was told that my function in life as a woman is to marry and bear children and to serve my husband and my children all my life with no expectations for mine. This book is any Muslim woman's life. This book is about my life, my female friends and relatives life. I am so pleased that this book is written which tells the world what women like Dr. Homa Darabi and so on have lived through.  I am buying this book and giving it as gifts and I ask others to do the same. Thank you Parvin Darabi and Romin P. Thomson to tell others what we go through.       Another book  The Stoning of Soroya M. describes how in 1986 a woman in a small village in Iran was buried up to her neck at the town square and the men of the village, including her father, husband, and sons, threw stones and rocks at her until she died. In the case of Soraya, a pious wife and mother, her abusive, criminal husband wanted to get rid of her and marry his mistress. Iranian-born French journalist Sahebjam, himself condemned to death by the Khomeini regime, uncovered this horror while reporting undercover on his native land. �  A video of an Islamic stoning can be seen here   Download Stoning Video .    Parvin Darabi wrote a testimony about her experience with Islam titled An Iranian Girlhood and Islamic Barbarism ( Leaving Islam , edited by Ibn Warraq).  In her testimony she wrote:     It has been reported that on August 15, 1991, the prosecutor general, Abolfazl Musavi-Tabrizi, said that �anyone who rejects the principle of Hijab is an apostate and the punishment for an apostate under Islamic law is death.�      Girls condemned to death may not undergo the sentence as long as they are virgins.  Thus, they are systematically raped before the sentence is executed:      To rape women prisoners, especially virgin girls, who are accused of being against the regime, is a normal and daily practice in the Islamic Republic�s prisons, and by doing so, the clergies declare that they adhere to the merits of the Islamic principles and laws, preventing a virgin girl to go to Heaven.  Mullahs believe that these are ungodly creatures and they dod not deserve it, therefore they are raped to be sure they will be sent to hell.        Roya Tolouee, 40, a democracy activist, was beaten up by Iranian intelligence agents and subjected to a horrific sexual assault when she refused to sign forced confessions. It was only when they threatened to burn her two children to death in front of her that she agreed to put her name to the documents.

Drug addiction is epidemic throughout Iran, and some addicted parents sell their children to support their habits. High unemployment -- 28 percent for youth 15 to 29 years of age, and 43 percent for women 15 to 20 years of age -- is a serious factor in driving restless youth to accept risky offers for work. Slave traders take advantage of any opportunity in which women and children are vulnerable. For example, following the recent earthquake in Bam, orphaned girls have been kidnapped and taken to a known slave market in Tehran where Iranian and foreign traders meet.   Since Muslims can marry and then divorce just by saying I divorce you three times, this means that Muslims can effectively marry and divorce as many women as they want.  This creates a religiously justified form of prostitution in which old men with money marry teenagers, have sex with them and leave them.

In Baghdad on Aug. 27, a mob beheaded a 70-year-old nun.  In Denmark in July, a Turkish immigrant murdered his daughter because she wanted to choose her own husband.       Similarly the BBC had an article about an Iranian girl sentenced to 100 lashes who filed a complaint against two men for kidnapping and raping her.  The judge explained:   The girl was sentenced to 100 lashes because her accusations of rape and kidnap could have landed her partners a death penalty. (BBC News,  Iran girl gets 100 lashes for sex , 2/25/05)      An Iranian girl who stabbed a man who was trying to rape her was sentenced to death by an Iranian court on January 10, 2006.  Another girl sixteen year old Atefeh Rajabi who was forced into adultery, was sentenced to death for having committed "acts incompatible with chastity".( Iran Focus-Iran to hang teenage girl attacked by rapists , 1/7/2006)       Stephen Brown wrote in  Frontpage Magazine how Nazanin Fateh a 17 year old Iranian woman was in a Tehran park with her fifteen-year-old niece and two boyfriends in March, 2005, when three men approached and pushed the two girls to the ground to rape them.             The brave boyfriends, meanwhile, fled on their motorcycles, leaving the two females to fend for themselves.                     In self-defense, Fateh pulled a knife and stabbed one of the assailants in the arm. The Iranian teenagers then tried to flee when Fateh stabbed another would-be rapist in the chest, killing the repulsive jackal. The young Iranian woman, it was reported, then waited for the police and gave them the knife.                 But despite her honesty and rightful claim to have acted in self-defense to protect both her and her niece�s honor, a criminal court in the Islamic theocracy sentenced her to death in January, 2006�         Ironically, even if Fateh had allowed herself to be raped, the legal result would probably have been the same.       In order to understand the logic of killing a daughter for being raped we need to understand that according to Islamic law intercourse outside of marriage is a crime, Period.  Serge Trifkovic in his outstanding book,  The Sword of the Prophet wrote that according to the New York Times (May 17, 2002)    a judge in Pakistan sentenced a young woman to death for "adultery" by stoning because she had been raped by her husband's brother.   The judge defended his action by saying that he had merely followed the Kuran based law that mandated this punishment.  The fact the woman, Zafran Bibi, was raped was of no consequence.  The woman had accused her brother in law of raping her and this was a confession to her crime of "having intercourse outside of marriage."  The Times noted that this case fit "a familiar pattern."       According to a report by the United Nations Population Fund, in Turkey: (Beattie, M.,  Woman Forced to Wed Rapists or Die , The Scotsman 11/22/05)   "When a girl is raped by a man, since she is no longer a virgin, it is usually believed that the best way to solve the problem is to get them married, especially if the man is not already married.  If the man is already married and the raped girl is pregnant, this creates a more complicated situation and usually ends in the girl's murder."  The report suggests that the practice of forcing rape victims to marry their attackers had been partly reinforced by an earlier, but now obsolete, Turkish penal code. This stipulated that if a rapist married his victim, his penalty would be suspended and if he stayed married to her for five years, it would be cancelled completely. The UN report, which is based on interviews with more than 250 people in Istanbul and other cities with large Kurdish populations, details several such cases.  One involved the rape of a mentally challenged girl. "The brothers of the girl offered her in marriage to the man and said that they would pay all wedding costs, all in an effort to avoid gossip," the report says. "In the end, they shot the man dead. Later, they threw the girl into a water channel. "Somehow the girl was not hurt; she was saved and then she was sent to another place through [social] organisations. However, the family is still after her."               The following excerpt is from an article about Muslim thinking about infidel women in Pakistan and how that thinking has been exported by immigrants to Australia (Lapkin, S.,  Muslim Gang Rapes and the Aussie Riots , 12/15/05)     In some parts of Pakistan, sexual assault � including gang rape � is officially sanctified as a legitimate form of enforcing the social value system.   One village council recently ordered that five young girls should be �abducted, raped or murdered� for refusing to be treated as chattel. The girls were aged between six and thirteen when they were married without their knowledge, to pay a family debt.   And when Mukhtar Mai�s 12-year-old brother was alleged to have committed an offence in a small Pakistani farming village, the village council ordered that his sister be gang-raped. So, she was taken to a hut where four men repeatedly assaulted her.   According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan there were 804 cases of such officially orchestrated sexual assault in 2000, and 434 of these were gang rapes. And if that isn�t bad enough, the victims of these atrocities are then expected to commit suicide because rape victims bring irreparable shame upon their families.      The following excerpt reveals the European Muslim's attitude toward women. ( Immigrant Rape Wave in Sweden   frontpagemag.com 12/15/05, )   The number of rape charges in Sweden has tripled in the last twenty years.  Rape cases involving children under the age of 15 are six - 6 - times as common today as they were a generation ago. Most other kinds of violent crime have rapidly increased, too. Resident aliens from Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia dominate the group of rape suspects... Lawyer Ann Christine Hjelm, who has investigated violent crimes in Svea high court, found that 85 per cent of the convicted rapists were born on foreign soil or by foreign parents.    Some Muslim immigrants admit their bias quite openly. An Islamic Mufti in Copenhagen sparked a political outcry after publicly declaring that women who refuse to wear headscarves are "asking for rape." Apparently, he's not the only one thinking this way. �It is not as wrong raping a Swedish girl as raping an Arab girl,� says Hamid. �The Swedish girl gets a lot of help afterwards, and she had probably fucked before, anyway. But the Arab girl will get problems with her family. For her, being raped is a source of shame. It is important that she retains her virginity until she marries.� It was no coincidence that it was a Swedish girl that was gang raped in Rissne � this becomes obvious from the discussion with Ali, Hamid, Abdallah and Richard. All four have disparaging views on Swedish girls, and think this attitude is common among young men with immigrant background. �It is far too easy to get a Swedish whore�� girl, I mean;� says Hamid, and laughs over his own choice of words. �Many immigrant boys have Swedish girlfriends when they are teenagers. But when they get married, they get a proper woman from their own culture who has never been with a boy. That�s what I am going to do. I don�t have too much respect for Swedish girls. I guess you can say they get fucked to pieces.� The number of rapes committed by Muslim immigrants in Western nations are so extremely high that it is difficult to view them only as random acts of individuals. It resembles warfare. Muhammad himself had forced sex (rape) with several of his slave girls/concubines. This is perfectly allowed, both in the sunna and in the Koran. If you postulate that many of the Muslims in Europe view themselves as a conquering army and that European women are simply war booty, it all makes perfect sense and is in full accordance with Islamic law. Western women are not so much regarded by most Muslims as individuals, but as "their women," the women who "belong" to hostile Infidels. They are booty, to be taken, just as the land of the Infidels someday will drop, it is believed, into Muslim hand. This is not mere crime, but ideologically-justified crime or rather, in Muslim eyes, attacks on Infidels scarcely qualify as crime. Western women are cheap and offensive. We Muslims are here, here to stay, and we have a right to take advantage of this situation. It is our view of the matter that should prevail. Western goods, like the land on which we now live, belong to Allah and to the best of men -- his Believers. Western women, too, essentially belong to us -- our future booty.     If a woman doesn't wear a headscarf that is seen as justification by some Muslims to rape her.  Sharon Lapkin, in an article titled  Western Muslims Racist Rape Spree wrote:   In Australia's New South Wales Supreme Court in December 2005, a visiting Pakistani rapist testified that his victims had no right to say no, because they were not wearing a headscarf.  And earlier this year Australians were outraged when Lebanese Sheik Faiz Mohammed gave a lecture in Sydney where he informed his audience that rape victims had no one to blame but themselves. Women, he said, who wore skimpy clothing, invited men to rape them. A few months earlier, in Copenhagen, Islamic mufti and scholar, Shahid Mehdi created uproar when � like his peer in Australia � he stated that women who did not wear a headscarf were asking to be raped. And with haunting synchronicity in 2004, the London Telegraph reported that visiting Egyptian scholar Sheik Yusaf al-Qaradawi claimed female rape victims should be punished if they were dressed immodestly when they were raped. He added, �For her to be absolved from guilt, a raped woman must have shown good conduct.�   Gang rape and even mutilation of women is carried out against the infidels.  Lapkin writes:   In Sweden, according to translator for Jihad Watch, Ali Dashti, �Gang rapes, usually involving Muslim immigrant males and native Swedish girls, have become commonplace.� A few weeks ago she said, �Five Kurds brutally raped a 13-year-old Swedish girl.� In France, Samira Bellil broke her silence � after enduring years of repeated gang rapes in one of the Muslim populated public housing projects � and wrote a book, In the hell of the tournantes, that shocked France. Describing how gang rape is rampant in the banlieues, she explained to Time that, �any neighborhood girl who smokes, uses makeup or wears attractive clothes is a whore.�  Unfortunately, Western women are not the only victims in this epidemic. In Indonesia, in 1998, human rights groups documented the testimony of over 100 Chinese women who were gang raped during the riots that preceded the fall of President Suharto. Many of them were told: �You must be raped, because you are Chinese and non-Muslim.� Christian Solidarity Worldwide reported that in April 2005, a 9-year-old Pakistani girl was raped, beaten with a cricket bat, hanged upside down from the ceiling, had spoonfuls of chillies poured into her mouth, and repeatedly bashed while handcuffed. Her Muslim neighbours told her they were taking revenge for the American bombing of Iraqi children and informed her they were doing it because she was an �infidel and a Christian.� In Sudan � where Arab Muslims slaughter black Muslim and Christian Sudanese in an ongoing genocide � former Sudanese slave and now a human rights� activist Simon Deng says he witnessed girls and women being raped and that the Arab regime of Khartoum sends its soldiers to the field to rape and murder. In other reports, women who are captured by government forces are asked; �Are you Christian or Muslim?� and those who answer Christian, are gang raped before having their breasts cut off.      I (the author of this web site) once read a story about the discovery of a dead girl locked up in a closet in a kitchen in Smyrna after the Muslim Turks wiped out the Christian Armenian population there.  Her breasts had been cut off.  I was shocked by the brutality and hatred that would have motivated such a crime and started doubting it ever happened but the above reports from Khartoum lend credibility to the account.     ��  Phyllis Chesler and Nancy Kobrin wrote an article about how  Muslims target women . �  They wrote:      The Islamist " Doctor's Plot " in the UK was fiendish, but one particularly horrific aspect of it has received insufficient attention: it was specifically aimed at women. �       Buried deep in the New York Times article on the subject was this fact: The Tiger Tiger nightclub in London was targeted in part because last Thursday was �ladies night.� (Christopher Hitchens,   writing  in Slate, is among the few so far who focused on this fact.)Nor is it the first time that Islamists have directly targeted women. British security expert Sajjan M. Gohel remembers a 2004 conspiracy in which "British-born bombers said they wanted to attract women at a nightclub, whom they viewed as promiscuous, in conversations monitored by the police."�             Often, a suicide bomber will purposely stand right next to a mother with a young child.        A Dutch filmmaker, Theo van Gogh, wrote columns about Islam that were published on his Web site,  www.theovangogh.nl , and in the Dutch newspaper Metro. He also made a film titled "Submission" with Somali-born Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a member of the Dutch parliament who had renounced the Islamic faith of her birth.(  My Way News 11/2/04 )   It told the fictional story of a Muslim woman forced into a violent marriage, raped by a relative and brutally punished for adultery. This film enraged the Muslims of the Netherlands even though similar stories have occurred in real life.  On Nov 2, 2004, a man with a long beard, wearing Islamic garb shot him several times, then stabbed him repeatedly and slit his throat with a butcher knife.  The murderer left a note on his body.  According to an article in frontpagemag.com ( Death of a Blasphemer , Robert Spencer, 11/3/04) the note contained verses from the Qu'ran.   According to the NRC Handelsblad newspaper the note called for an Islamic holy war.   According to  scotsman.com (11/8/04) a five-page letter addressed to Ayaan, was pinned to his body with a knife. Here is some of the text of the note ( Netherlands Braces For Jihad , frontpagemag.com 11/11/04)   "Death, Ms. Hirsi Ali, is the common theme of all that exists. You and the rest of the cosmos cannot escape this truth."    "There will come a day when one soul cannot help another soul. A day that goes paired with terrible tortures, ... when the unjust will press horrible screams from their lungs.     "Screams, Ms. Hirsi Ali, that will cause chills to run down a person's back, and make the hairs on their heads stand straight up. People will be drunk with fear, while they are not drunken. Fear will fill the air on the Great Day,"     "I know definitely that you, Oh America, will go down. I know definitely that you, Oh Europe, will go down. I know definitely that you, Oh Netherlands, will go down. I know definitely that you, Oh Hirsi Ali, will go down."       According to Robert Spencer the note said (frontpagemag.com  Europe Confronts Racism ):   hair- raising screams will be squeezed from the lungs of the non-believers.   After the murder, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, received a death threat saying: "You are next." She has been living for months surrounded by government bodyguards 24 hours a day.  Pim Fortuyn is another Dutch politician who was murdered because of his opinions regarding Islam.  Robert Spencer wrote about other Islamic murders to silence free speech.   He wrote:   In 1947, the Iranian lawyer Ahmad Kasravi was murdered in court by Islamic radicals; Kasravi was there to defend himself against charges that he had attacked Islam. Four years later, members of the same radical Muslim group, Fadayan-e Islam, assassinated Iranian Prime Minister Haji-Ali Razmara after a group of Muslim clerics issued a fatwa calling for his death. In 1992, the Egyptian writer Faraj Foda was murdered by Muslims enraged at his �apostasy� from Islam � another offense for which traditional Islamic law prescribes the death penalty. Foda�s countryman, the Nobel Prizewinning novelist Naguib Mahfouz, was stabbed in 1994 after accusations of blasphemy. Under     Pakistan �s blasphemy laws, many non-Muslims have been arrested, tortured, and sentenced to die on the slimmest of evidence. And of course, there is the Ayatollah Khomeini�s notorious death fatwa against Salman Rushdie.       Wendy McElroy wrote an article about the  plight of women under the Taliban regime for Foxnews.com 9/18/01.  The Taliban are extreme even by Iranian standards who as of October 9, 01 are helping the Northern Alliance rebels against the Taliban.  The Iranians say the Taliban's version of Islam is an affront to the faith and hypocritical, because they profit from drug smuggling. Still, the Iranians came out against the U.S. attack on the Taliban.  (New York Post October 9, 2001)    On May 19, 2002, the New York Times reported that a woman named Zafran Bibi who had been raped in Pakistan faced death by stoning.   Thumping a fat red statute book, the white-bearded judge who convicted her, Anwar Ali Khan, said he had simply followed the letter of the Koran-based law, known as hudood, that mandates punishments.     "The illegitimate child is not disowned by her and therefore is proof of zina," he said, referring to laws that forbid any sexual contact outside marriage. Furthermore, he said, in accusing her brother-in-law of raping her, Zafran had confessed to her crime.       The case raised an outcry in Pakistan but according to Rukhshanda Naz, who heads the local branch of a women's rights group called Aurat, even if the case returns to a more typical course, she is likely to spend 10 to 15 years in prison, said.  As many as 80 percent of all women in Pakistani jails have been convicted under laws that ban extramarital sex, according to Aurat.      Human rights groups say abuse of women is endemic in Pakistan. Often, they are locked inside their homes where they are subjected to beatings, acid attacks, burning and rape. Every year there are hundreds of "honor killings," in which a woman is murdered for perceived breaches of modesty (New York Times 5/19/02).      Women may also be killed if they refuse to marry a husband that is arranged for them.  In 2003, three young men with axes hacked to death their two sisters for spurning their family's attempts to force them into arranged marriages   ( Killing Women for Honor by Ted Lapkin 1/28/04).     If you are a Christian woman in Pakistan you are a target of Muslims just for being an infidel.  In one case a Christian girl named Tabasumwas also a target because her parents reported a Muslim brothel to the police.  One night she went out late to buy some loaves of bread and was reportedly abducted by her former neighbors and two other men. According to the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance, APMA, "They put a piece of cloth soaked in some intoxicant on her mouth, after which she fainted." When Tabasum regained consciousness three men raped her.  She was told  that she could be "saved" if she embraced Islam and married one of the Muslims.  According to APMA, "On refusing, Sara was beaten badly during captivity and shifted to another house ... where five persons raped her. She was repeatedly asked to embrace Islam and recite (the) Islamic creed to save herself from the misery but refused. (worldnetdaily  16 Muslims Reportedly Rape Christian Girl , WorldnetDaily.com 10/2/05)   Suzanne Fields wrote an article in Sept 2005 that: (Fields, S.,  Making the Muslims Love Us , Townhall.com 9/29/05)   Turkish women who have thrown off their chadors in Germany and gone secular in dress and dating habits have paid the full price for their rebellion. In recent months, at least six Muslim women have been murdered in "honor killings"; a women's organization documents more than 40 honor killings in less than a decade. Their killers have been brothers, husbands and fathers, and are generally revered as heroes in their insulated communities.       Inspite of all this oppression of women, Muslim men are very offended if anyone says that they do.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Dutch Muslim woman, had to flee the Netherlands because she said that Muslim men oppressed Muslim women, a vile idea that so outraged Muslim men that they issued death threats against her. (Salman Rushdie, New York Times, 11/27/02)     The New York Post reported on 7/4/02 how a boy was punished who walked unchaperoned with a girl from a different tribe.  The Mastoi tribe demanded punishment after the teenager's brother was seen walking unchaperoned with a Mastoi girl in a deserted part of the village. The brother and sister are from the Gujar tribe, which is considered to be lower-class.  The boy's father, Ghulam Farid, 54, said he pleaded for clemency, telling the council the Mastoi girl was safe with his son because he was too young to have sex. Farid said.   I told the tribal jury that my son is ready to marry [the girl], if they think she had been molested, But Mastoi tribesmen rejected this proposal, saying how could they give their daughter to me, a low-caste tribal.    A Pakistani council ordered that his sister be gang raped to shame his family as a punishment.  Four members of the council then gang raped her.  The young woman told The Associated Press on the previous day   I said I taught the holy Koran to children in the village, therefore don't punish me for a crime which was not committed by me. But they tore my clothes and raped me one by one.    Worldnetdaily reported that (Christian Girl Abducted by Muslims 1/22/04) Shamim Kausor, of the district of Toba Tek Singh in Punjab province, was abducted from her home Dec. 31, 2003 by men who pulled up in a jeep.     International Christian Concern said young Christian girls in Pakistan often are abducted and raped and forced to marry Muslim men but generally have no rights or recourse for the crimes committed against them.   According to worldnetdaily:   This was the second abduction of Kausor, and several neighbors recognized a man who kidnapped her several months ago.     At that time, Kausor's father, Afzal Masih, employed the help of police to rescue his daughter. He tried to initiate legal proceedings against the man but was strongly dissuaded by Muslim village leaders.     The kidnapper taunted and threatened the girl after the first abduction, ICC reported.     At one point he said, "A beautiful girl like you should not remain Christian. I will make you Muslim and you will bear a Muslim child."     The police are not interested in helping Masih this time, however, ICC said.     ��  The confessions of a former kidnapper can be viewed  online . �  The kidnapper succeeded in getting a woman to convert to Islam and wrote what happened then:     After five weeks of achieving this victory for Islam and receiving my financial reward, I decided that I did not want to keep this faithless whore as my wife. She was cheap to me and was merely an object for sensual pleasure.  How could I have a son with her who has in him the blood of those Christian infidels? I reasoned.  I ordered her to have an abortion and I used my legitimate right to beat her. I also obliged her to work for her food. I told her she had to serve her Muslim masters who put a roof over her head and she had to be grateful that I married her and saved her from her shame.        Stories of kidnapped girls can be viewed  here . �  It's important to note that not all Pakistanis behave this way.         There are many honor killings of women by Palestinian Arabs.  In a story for World and I magazine, James Emery quoted a Palestinian Arab merchant as saying     A woman shamed is like rotting flesh,  If it is not cut away, it will consume the body. What I mean is the whole family will be tainted if she is not killed.          Emery says the reasons for honor killings include allegations of premarital or extramarital sex, for refusing an arranged marriage or attempting to obtain a divorce, or simply for talking with a man. The murders are carried out by fathers, husbands, brothers, uncles, cousins or sons.        Among Palestinians, all sexual encounters, including rape and incest, are blamed on the woman. ( WorldnetDaily 5/6/03)       Phyllis Chesler wrote in an article in FrontpageMagazine.com ( Forced Female Suicide 1/21/04) that Palestinian Arabs have created a new form of honor killing in which they coerce a woman who has dishonored her family into redeeming her honor by committing a suicide bombing of Jews.     For some time now, reports have reached my desk about Palestinian girls and women being recruited, seduced, and trapped, by older male terrorists in very woman-specific ways.    For example, I have been told that in one instance, the chosen Palestinian girl was unmarried and pregnant. She was offered the chance to "cleanse" her honor by blowing herself and Jews up. Her family spirited her out of the West Bank to safety in Europe. I have also been told that some Palestinian masters of mass murder have themselves had affairs with vulnerable young Palestinian girls in order to compromise their "honor" and to season them, pimp-style, for martyrdom. Hard facts are hard to come by, anecdotes abound.      Reem al-Riyashi a mother of two who was married to a Hamas terrorist is alleged to have had an affair with another one.  Phyllis Chesler wrote that    Allegedly, al-Riyashi's husband was a Hamas activist and her lover was a Hamas operative who had carried out the love affair with the express purpose of recruiting her. According to the British Sunday Times, al-Riyashi's husband himself drove her to the border crossing.      Mrs. al-Riyashi was given an option, redeem the family honor by blowing herself up and killing lots of non-believing Jews and most likely get subsidies from Islamic charities for her children that she left behind or be killed in disgrace without subsidies for her children.  Phyllis wrote regarding her being seduced into suicide:   This is unbelievable--and tragic. Had these men threatened to kill her children if she refused this mission? I would not be surprised.      It is interesting that in the video made by Ms. Riyashi she said that "she loved her children so much".  Would someone who loved their children kill themselves and leave their children without a mother?  Or would she kill herself in order to protect them?       ��  The only Palestinian women who extremist Palestinian men appear to respect are the ones who martyr themselves. �  Doesn�t do the women much good when they�re dead. �  Women may differ from men in rights but they do not differ from men in duties according to Hamas member of the Palestinian Parliament   Yunis Al-Astal. �  Those duties  include Jihad  .      Some religions portray women are as sources of evil temptation.  This has led to rules forcing women to cover themselves.  Olivier Guitta in an article titled  Veiled Threat (frontpagemag.com 4/4/05) wrote:   Most Muslim French women who wear the hijab are forced to do so by their family or because of pressure from the community. In many testimonies young women have stated that they were wearing it not to be "bothered" by the men in their community. There were multiple cases in the suburbs of Paris of gang rapes of women who were too "Westernized".        Olivier Guitta wrote: ( Leaving No French Islamist Behind , The Weekly Standard (5/20/05)     An official report dealing with religious expression in French schools has become a must read for anyone interested in the Islamization of France. Written under the auspices of the top national education official, Jean-Pierre Obin, the report was not initially released by the Ministry of Education. But it was leaked on the Internet in March and now can be found in its entirety at www.proche-orient.info and other websites...     The biggest social change entailed by this Islamization, Obin reports, is a deterioration in the position of females. Teenage girls are forbidden to play sports and are constantly watched by an informal religious police made up of young men, sometimes their own younger brothers. Makeup, skirts, and form-fitting dresses are forbidden; dark, loose trousers are the strongly recommended attire. To go to the blackboard in front of a class, some Muslim girls put on long coats. Often, they are forced to wear the headscarf, or hijab, and forbidden to frequent coed movie theaters, community centers, and gyms, or even to go out at all on weekends.    ..    Inevitably, the report records rampant "Judeophobia," to use the term in vogue in France. Among even the youngest students, the term "Jew" has become the all-purpose insult. .. Even more serious is the increase in assaults on Jews or those presumed to be Jewish. Usually the assailants are Muslim students. Sometimes the victims are, too: One Turkish high-school girl was relentlessly harassed and bullied at school because her country is an ally of Israel...    As for history, Muslim students object to its Judeo-Christian bias and blatant falsehood. They loudly protest the Crusades, and commonly deny the Holocaust. Under the circumstances, many teachers censor their own material, often skipping entire topics, like the history of Israel or of Christianity. The report cites one teacher who keeps a Koran on his desk for reference whenever a thorny issue arises. It cites Muslim students who refuse to use the plus sign in mathematics because it looks like a cross. Field trips, especially to churches, cathedrals, and monasteries, are boycotted...    Summing up, Obin explains his disturbing findings as the result primarily of indoctrination orchestrated over years by international Muslim organizations. From an early age, students are taught what to think, what to believe, and to regard their school teachers as liars. The goal of the radical groups seeking to segregate Muslim communities and denouncing integration as oppression, Obin writes, is to take the Muslim residents of France out of the French nation and make them think of themselves as part of the international Muslim community.    USA Today reported on September 14, 01 that a Muslim rebel group in Kashmir, Lashkar-e-Jabar, has threatened to shoot women if they do not wear veils.   Lashkar-e-Jabar sprayed acid on two unveiled women in the month prior to making the threat.  Adriana Stuijt in her article " International Terrorist Support Groups Thrive in Belgium and Netherlands"   (Monday, Sept. 24, 2001  Newsmax.com ) writes how:   Moslem gangs in Holland organize attacks against non-Muslims in shopping centers and at sporting and cultural events. During these organized attacks, in which youths spray people with insecticide and beat them with batons, the youths specially target ethno-European girls and women, demanding that they wear head scarves and start obeying the strict Muslim shari'a laws which require total subservience to males.       Kafir, a pseudonym for the founder of  anti-Jihad wrote in an email on July 28, 02 that:   Muslim immigrants are causing a lot of trouble here in Sweden, just like they are causing trouble around the world. In order to protect the family's "honor", many have killed their daughters/sisters because they "behave like whores", i.e. like western women...They have gang-raped Swedish girls (who they consider "whores"), when our Liberal Party held a demonstration against anti-semitism they were attacked by Moslems who took their placards and used them to beat up the people who had protested against anti-semitism.       Muslims have imported honor killings into the rest of Europe and even into the United States.  Olivier Guitta in his article Veield Threat wrote:   the number of "honor crimes" - where women are attacked by relatives for "shaming" the family name -- has increased alarmingly in Europe in the past year. For instance, according to the German TV Station ARD, ten "honor crimes" have been committed in Germany since summer 2004.   A horrible recent one has scandalized German opinion. A Turkish Muslim woman, a 23-year-old mother of one, was gunned down at a Berlin bus stop. The presumed culprits are three of her brothers who repeatedly threatened her. For them, she led an "un-Islamic" life because she had stopped wearing the hijab and was outgoing. On top of this horrific murder, the reactions among some Turks living in Germany are disgusting. For instance, a male student of Turkish origin at a high school located near the scene of the crime, said, "She deserved what she got -- the whore lived like a German."           Another country where "honor crimes" have been rising and publicized is the Netherlands. In the past weeks, three "honor crimes" have been committed. A Dutch politician of Somali descent, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, has been very vocal on the issue. Hirsi Ali co-wrote with Theo Van Gogh the documentary critical of Islam, over which Van Gogh was brutally murdered by a Moroccan Islamist. She now lives in hiding, protected by bodyguards because of the numerous death treats she received, including one from Van Gogh's killer. She explains that most times the killers in honor crimes are the youngest males in the family, often minors. Indeed because they face a lesser jail sentence, it is quite convenient for the family. Therefore, Hirsi Ali suggests that the whole family be judged for the crime, at least for complicity. Also according to her, "honor crimes" should be included in a new Dutch anti-terrorist law.          Do not think for a moment this only happens in Europe. In April 2004, in Scottsville, NY, a Turkish immigrant savagely murdered his wife and nearly killed his daughters because they had been molested by his brother. He allegedly told investigators that: "I was concerned that my family's honor was taken".         Bishop Dolli, an Episcopal bishop from Sudan was in Washington in the week of Oct 15-19 2001 at the invitation of the Institute on Religion and Democracy. He attempted to warn Congress and anyone else who would listen of the dangers to his country and the United States posed by Islam, especially in its militant form.  He said that in the Sudan, all women, whether Muslim or not, are forced to wear the black chador and veil.      Dennis Bennett, executive director of Seattle-based  Servant's Heart told WorldNetDaily (3/4/02) about the oppression of non-Muslim women in the Sudan.  He said:    Villagers in several areas of the northeast Upper Nile region say that when women are captured by government forces they are asked: "Are you Christian or Muslim?"     Women who answer "Muslim" are set free, but typically soldiers gang-rape those who answer "Christian" then cut off their breasts and leave them to die as an example for others.      According to WorldnetDaily ( Islamists Rape 100 Women in Attack, 3/20/04 )   Arab militias backed by Khartoum's radical Muslim regime raped more than 100 women in an attack in western Sudan.     Mukesh Kapila, the United Nations coordinator for Sudan, told the BBC 75 people were killed in the attack on the village of Tawila two weeks ago.     "All houses as well as a market and a health center were completely looted and the market burnt," he said. "Over 100 women were raped, six in front of their fathers who were later killed."     The attack, in which a further 150 women and 200 children were abducted, was one of many as village after village was razed by the militias, Kapila said.     Sudan's cleric-backed National Islamic Front regime in the Arab and Muslim north declared a jihad on the mostly Christian and animist south in 1989. Since 1983, an estimated 2 million people have died from war and related famine. About 5 million have become refugees.      As WorldNetDaily reported , Khartoum government forces also are alleged to have gang-raped women, sometimes forcing them to deny their Christian faith or be killed.       According to an Amnesty International Report of July 19, 2004, Arab militias in Sudan are gang-raping and abducting girls as young as eight and women as old as 80, systematically killing, torturing, or using them as sex slaves.   "When we tried to escape they shot more children," one woman identified only as A. told Amnesty researchers.    "They raped women, I saw many cases of Janjaweed raping women and girls. They are happy when they rape. They sing when they rape and they tell us that we are just slaves and that they can do with us how they wish."      Phylis Chesler wrote an article ( Feminism's Deafening Silence, Frontpagemag.com 7/26/04 ) about the horrific abuses of Islam in the Sudan.   Islamic law allows such behavior toward women captured in Jihad. (see  Who Was Muhammad )     Robert Spencer in an article titled  Muslim Target  (frontpagemag.com 6/14/05) wrote:   The Qur�an permits Muslim men to have intercourse with their wives and their slave girls: �Forbidden to you are ... married women, except those whom you own as slaves� (Sura 4:23 -24). The slave girls are understood to be the wives of men slain in battle by the warriors of jihad. The Islamic legal manual �Umdat al-Salik, which carries the endorsement of Al-Azhar University, the most respected authority in Sunni Islam, stipulates: �When a child or a woman is taken captive, they become slaves by the fact of capture, and the woman�s previous marriage is immediately annulled.�         [10]     Why? So that they are free to become the concubines of their captors.      England's Telegraph Group Ltd. wrote a report (March 15, 2002) that quotes Saudi newspapers to the effect that scuffles broke out between firemen and members of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice when the latter tried to keep the girls inside a burning school in Mecca.  Fifteen girls were killed as they stampeded to escape from the blazing building in the holy Muslim city.   The Telegraph reported that a civil defense officer said that he saw three members of the religious police "beating young girls to prevent them from leaving the school because they were not wearing the abaya."  According to Jonathan Foreman of the New York Post 3/25/02 the religious police refused to allow firemen into the burning school either because that would have amounted to impermissible mixing of the sexes. This story was  also reported by the BBC online on March 15, 02.     Islam brainwashes women into believing that they deserve to be beaten.  According to a survey carried out by the Anatolia News Agency.   According to Turkishpress.com 10/22/04    39 percent of women in Turkey believe their husbands are right to beat them for at least one of the following reasons: burning the meal, disputing the opinion of their husbands, spending money unnecessarily, neglecting the children or refusing to have sex.     In rural areas, 57 percent of women said their spouses had a right to batter them in at least one of the above circumstances.     Arguing with the husband topped the list of justified reasons for domestic violence, followed by too much spending and the negligence of children.       The following story about Ms. Kola Boof is from WorldnetDaily.com.  To view the original article click  here .  On Sept 26, after Kola Boof wrote a book called   Long Train to the Redeeming Sin: Stories About African Women Sudanese diplomat Gamal Ibrahim issued a fatwa. calling for Kola Boof to be beheaded, after a Shariah court in London's Islamic community declared her guilty of "deliberately and maliciously bearing false witness against religious sentiment and of willing treason against her Arab Muslim father's people and against her nation, the Sudan."      Kola Boof was born in Omdurman, which is part of north Khartoum, in the Sudan.  She was about 10 to 12 years of age � there are no records of her birth � when her Egyptian father and Somali mother were slaughtered in their backyard in 1978 by Arab Murahleen bandits for speaking out too openly about the coming Arab regime.     She said she is familiar with the kind of atrocities recounted by ex-slave Frances Bok, who stood with President Bush as he signed the Sudan Peace Act on Oct. 21.    I witnessed the kind of raids he's talking about, where Arab men will come in on horses in the little villages, and they'll shoot all the men in the head, and then they'll kidnap the children and women, and you never see those people again.    The Khartoum government is paying for these militia she maintains, "no matter what they say. Everybody there knows."      As a child, she said she witnessed a woman with six daughters who could not bear a son be rolled up in her dowry carpet and burned alive after gasoline was poured on her.      After the fatwa was issued against her Kola Boof said:   As a black African woman, I cannot and will not be silent as black men in Arab nations are chained up like dogs to the back doors of Muslim households and fed, literally, from doggie bowls.  I will not be silent as African women are raped, mutilated and mentally demeaned by sadistic human beings calling themselves children of Allah. I will not be silent as the number of little black boys who are sodomized by their Arab masters continues to soar, while even worse atrocities attend the lives of little black girls.      According to the National Review Dec 23, 02, Osama Bin Laden told Kola Boof in a 1988 telephone conversation:   If I had the time to waste, I would slit your throat myself.   On Thursday Nov. 7 02, a handful of demonstrators gathered on Boof's behalf in front of the Sudanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., and outside the United Nations building in New York City. Publicists for the event included  Sudan activist Maria Sliwa , who said only about a dozen showed up.      Intimidation by the Sudanese Embassy and by people claiming to be members of Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam scared away others who wanted to protest     Another demonstration, in Los Angeles, had to be canceled, Boof said, "because the organizer was so terrified about Farrakhan's people calling her that she pulled out."      The belief that women are sources of evil temptation has encouraged the widespread practice of female circumcision.   Once every 15 seconds another woman has surgery  performed on her clitoris so that she won't be able to be sexually aroused and so will be less likely to commit adultery or premarital sex.  In an article titled  Islam's Hatred of the Clitoris ( FrontPageMag.com October 19, 2001) Jamie Glazov wrote:   The Muslims are the principal religious group that practice female circumcision. In Egypt, for instance, 97 percent of women are circumcised. Their clitorises are amputated. In countries like Sudan, meanwhile, the women-haters are not so kind: all the women�s external genital organs are completely removed. In a savagery called infibulation, the clitoris, the two major outer lips (labia majora) and the two minor inner lips (labia minora) are amputated.    Nawal El Saadawi has documented these horrifying realities in  The Hidden Face of Eve: Women in the Arab World .   She demonstrates how the violence of female circumcision is performed on girls anywhere from the ages of one month to puberty. Usually, it is done around the age of seven or eight. Anesthetics are never used. The child is pinned down by several women, while one of them attacks.     In another article Sexual Amputation and Silence ( frontpagemag.com 12/2/04 ) Jamie Glazov explained the motivation for female circumcision as follows:   The impulse behind this savagery is clear: the hatred of women and the terrifying fear of their sexuality. Demonizing female sexual desire and pleasure -- and annihilating it -- becomes the priority. To successfully achieve female genital mutilation, therefore, the mutilators have to legitimize and institutionalize it. As a result, they socially construct the pathological ideology that a girl�s genital area is �dirty� and, therefore, unacceptable. In     Egypt , an uncircumcised girl is considered nigsa (unclean). The way she becomes non-nigsa is to have her clitoris sliced off. In Sudan, the term used for getting rid of the clitoris is tahur -- which means �cleansing� or �purification.�..     female genital mutilation produces the oxygen that Islamic fundamentalism needs to breathe. It helps militant Islam keep intact the foundation on which its life depends: the subjugation and enslavement of women under a rigid system of gender apartheid...        Any hint of opposition to mutilation is consistently met with furious resistance from Islamic clerics, who fervently emphasize that female genital mutilation is Allah�s will and point to the Prophet�s sanctioning of female circumcision in the hadiths to prove it. Umdat al-Salik, e4.3, therefore, a manual of Shafi'i Islamic law, which is endorsed by Al-Azhar University of Cairo, Egypt (the oldest and most prestigious university in the Islamic world), states that circumcision is obligatory for both men and women.     The prominent Egyptian Sheikh Mustafa Al-Azhari is one of the heroes of the pro-mutilation movement. He has led the way by insisting, among other things, that the attempt to stop female genital mutilation is a Western conspiracy designed to spread promiscuity among Muslims. For him, the Egyptian media�s attempt to stop female circumcision is a �crime.� Surgical specialist at Al-Azhar University, Dr. Muhammad Rif'at Al-Bawwab, meanwhile, puts it more simply: the pleasure that women derive from the clitoris is simply just unnatural and abnormal -- and leads to moral degradation.      In Denmark, Imam Mustafa Abdullahi Aden said that female circumcision was a religious duty.  The New York Sun writes that (11/14/02):   He said:"It is good for girls to be circumcised.  It is a sign that they are true Muslims."  He recommended a method which involves the removal of both the clitoris and labia.      Robert Spencer wrote that two million women a year die of sepsis or loss of blood because of circumcision.( Muslim Target, Frontpagemag.com 6/14/05)     Ironically Islamic theology which preaches that women are trouble, makes women into an evil temptation to kill the infidel, by preaching that men who die in Jihad or holy war will have virgins in heaven.  In the terror guide used by the hijackers who crashed planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, the following was written:   Also, do not seem confused or show signs of nervous tension. Be happy, optimistic calm because you are heading for a deed that God loves and will accept [as a good deed]. It will be the day, God willing, you spend with the women of paradise...Know that the gardens of paradise are waiting for you in all their beauty, and the women of paradise are waiting, calling out, "Come hither, friend of God." They have dressed in their most beautiful clothing.      In a memo in Mohammed Atta's luggage  (the pilot of the first plane that hit the World Trade Center (New York Post Oct 3, 01 p38)) the following was written:    Apply the rules of the prisoners of war.  Take them prisoner and kill them as God said.  The nymphs are calling out to you, come over here, companion of Allah.         I'm not sure if the terror guide and the Memo are one and the same as I got these quotes from different papers.  Since there were differences in the text given by the two papers I have listed both of them.        This use of sex by Islam to incite violence was understood by Thomas Aquinas who in  Summa Contra Gentiles , described Islam as a false and dangerous religion, which combines truths with "fables," twists the Old and New Testaments into a "fabrication" of Mohammed's own, and seduces "people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh urges us."      Yet Muslims see themselves as moral and the West as corrupt when it comes to women.  One example of this outlook was the reaction of Muslims to a newspaper article about an upcoming Miss World pageant to be held Dec. 7 02 in the Nigerian capital, Abuja.  Muslim groups say beauty pageants promotes sexual promiscuity and indecency.  A journalist, Isioma Daniel tried to defend the pageant and wrote in the article:   What would (the prophet) Muhammad think? In all honesty, he would probably have chosen a wife from among them (the contestants).      Come to think of it he probably would have chosen all of them to be part of his harem but Isioma didn't write that, I did.  It's lucky I'm not a reporter in Nigeria.  In response to Isioma's article, violent demonstrators in the northern city of Kaduna burned churches and rampaged through the streets.  Angry Muslims shouting "Down with Beauty" and "Allahu Akbar", rioted and stabbed and set fire to bystanders.  About 175 people were killed and  injured.  This continued until hundreds of soldiers were deployed to restore calm and enforce a dusk-to-dawn curfew. ( fresnoBee.com World News 11/22/02 )  The pageant then moved to London after which some Muslims in Britain also called for the event to be canceled.  Sajjad Khan, of the Islamic Liberation Party in Britain, told British Broadcasting Corp. radio on 11/23/02.(New York Post 11/24/02)    It is wrong that it should happen in Britain, in Nigeria or in any country.  I think the whole idea of having a beauty contest anywhere would be against many forward-thinking people of whatever faith and whatever ideology.      On 11/27/02 the deputy governor  of a largely Islamic state in Nigeria, Mahamoud Shinkafi announced that Muslims had permission to kill Isioma.  He said:   The blood of Isioma Daniel can be shed     Part of the irony of all of this is that the Koran describes Muhammad as  having more than a dozen wives and concubines and as having sex with a slave and of marrying a 9 year old girl by the name of Aisha.      A beauty pageant was held in Baghdad on April 9 2006.  Silva Shahakian, an Iraqi Christian, received the title of Miss Iraq when the initial winner stepped down after receiving death threats and two other runners-up also bowed out, a person familiar with the event said.      Since receiving the crown, Shahakian has been lying low, fearing she will be targeted, he said. The pageant was held April 9 in a Baghdad social club and the initial winner, Tamar Goregian, gave back the crown four days later, he said.     According to an article titled  Hating a Woman's Face , (Washington Times 10/18/04) in Baghdad   Islamist extremists are targeting the city's universities by threatening and even attacking female students who wear Western-style fashions, setting off bombs on campuses and demanding that classes be segregated by sex.    ...        Pamphlets found on campus declared: "If the boy students don't separate from the girl students, we will explode the college. Any girl student who does not wear a veil, we will burn her face with chemicals."    The book Saudi Arabia Exposed exposes some of the bizarreness of Muslim morality. �  According to the book:     �       �When they lived in Florida preparing their attack, some of the Saudi hijackers had draped a cloth over a framed print of a woman in their room, their Wahhabi upbringing making them despise this image of the human form.  They also frequently hung out on the balcony overlooking their apartment pool,  eyeing up the sunbathing girls in bikinis.  Other of the hijackers frequented strip clubs in Boston, made phone calls to escort services, and paid prostitutes for sex...�                 Young Saudis are given to saying that screwing Western women is not religiously forbidden in Islam, because, since they are "infidels," they do not come into the  moral scheme of things.               The Muslim world is so insane that although it engages in horrific oppression of women, King of Saudi Arabia fired the minister of information because a cartoon passed the censors in which Mickey Mouse gave Minnie a little peck. (Serge Trifkovic, The Sword and the Prophet).   ��            Beauty is not the only thing that enrages Jihadists.   Love does as well.  Walid Phares in an article titled  Valentine's Day Enrages Jihadists (Frontpagemagazine.com 2/14/04) wrote:   "Al Gharam mamn�uh, al Gharam kufr," screamed the self-declared cleric in al Ansar�s chat room this Friday. �Love is forbidden, love is infidel� -- said the online Fatwa about the �legitimacy of loving and being in love.�     A weekend before Valentine's Day, Jihadi souls were not questioning the �commercialization� of romance, but inquiring about the ban on �being in love.� The �scholars� said human love is evil. The simple feeling of being attracted to or in love with someone is a terrifying sin if it is committed outside of dogma. And it warrants serious punishment.     �Al Hub� (basic love) -- said one of the scholars online -- �is not permissible outside commitment to Jihad.� The subject was new, overwhelming to the al Qaida sympathizers who were dodging the �decadent feeling.�        There is hope though.  Walid Phares writes:    On the Internet, Arab, Persian, Kurdish, Aramaic and other love and music chat rooms attract ten times fold the Ansar-crowded rooms. There, you read and hear quality love discussions; not decadence, but the early stages of a romantic revolution.     Lebanon�s TV has taken the freedom for love to sophisticated artistic expressions. With shows seen by millions, the LBCI has been shaking off the fundamentalist quarters of the region. On al Jazeera, clerics are horrified by the scenes. It is a nightmare to see young Saudi men singing the beauty of human love when their Jihadi counterparts were assassinating Iraqi young women in Falluja for not wearing the Hijab...       Valentine's may be infidel in the eyes of the Jihadists, but it has many more faithful followers among the peoples of this unlucky region. The terrorists are not intimidated by death, but they are terrorized by love.   Perhaps the greatest abuse of Islam towards women is turning them into extremist suicide bombers.  According to Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir, who has interviewed bin Laden, there is a ready supply of female jihadists in his country alone who would be thrilled to help al Qaeda. ( Veiled Threat )   "Our women are more extremist than the men," he said in a recent magazine interview. "There are hundreds here."       Further Reading:     The Violent Oppression of Women in Islam by Robert Spencer and Phyllis Chesler    It's Time to Take the Campus Back by Phyllis Chesler               started 3/21/04        Visit:  Philosophy in Practice   (suspended)                Advice WebRing     by   karenperalta      [   Join Now  |   Ring Hub  |   Random  |    << Prev  |   Next >>   ]           Ring  WebRing         � 2001-2004 WebRing Inc. -  Help  -  Browse WebRing                             Global Leadership: you are invited !
