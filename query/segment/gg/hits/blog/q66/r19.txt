The ultra-conservative   Islamic state has said it has the right to stop   women revealing 'tempting' eyes in public.   A spokesperson for Saudi Arabia's Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, said a proposal to enshrine the measure in law has been tabled.  Women in Saudi Arabia already have to wear a long black cloak, called an abaya, cover their hair and, in some regions, conceal their faces while in public. If they do not, they face punishments including fines and public floggings. They are also banned from driving by religious edict and cannot travel without authorisation from their male guardians.         In September, a Saudi women   sentenced to 10 lashes for defying the driving ban was only spared when King Abdullah stepped in to stop the public flogging. Also in September, the king announced that women would be given the right to vote for the first time and run in the country's 2015 local elections. The CPVPV, which employs around 3,500 religious police, has repeatedly been accused of human rights violations.   Founded in 1940, its function is to ensure Islamic laws are not broken in public in Saudi Arabia.    In 2002 the committee refused to allow female students out of a burning school in Mecca because they were not wearing the correct head covering. The decision contributed to the toll of 15 people who were killed in the fire.
