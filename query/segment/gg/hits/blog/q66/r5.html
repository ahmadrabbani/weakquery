              mosque in Rome? Sure. A non-Muslim in Mecca? No. (Jonathan V. Last, 
              Wall Street Journal, Aug 29, 2003):</a> &quot;If you judge by the 
              pictures, the Makkah Hilton is a nice place to stay. There's just 
              one catch, as the Web site notes. The five-star hotel 'is exclusively 
              sited within the Holy City which, <strong><b><font color="#CC0000">by 
              national and religious law, is only accessible to visitors of the 
              Muslim Religion</font></b></strong>.' This law is something of a 
              singularity among major religions, because it isn't merely the Grand 
              Mosque that is off-limits to nonbelievers, the way, for instance, 
              a Mormon Temple is. It's a city--a major city with hotels, supermarkets, 
              schools and a population of 1.2 million people. (The city of Medina, 
              population 700,000, also forbids non-Muslims.) ... The ban sometimes 
              creates logistical woes. Companies that rely on skilled workers 
              often resort to using auxiliary offices outside the city. Ms. Mackey 
              tells of <strong><b><font color="#CC0000">the building of a hotel 
              designed by a Western architect. The Saudis refused to allow him 
              into the city and, she writes, 'insisted that he stand on a hill 
              outside of town and direct the work through a telescope</font></b></strong>.' 
              ... But even at the State Department, the ban rankles. 'Every religion 
              needs to have its own freedom of assembly and be able to protect 
              the integrity of its holy places,' said one State Department expert. 
              'But it's just absurd that it goes to these great lengths. . . . 
              <strong><b><font color="#CC0000">Even if you don't care about lofty 
              ideals like religious freedom or openness, we're starting to see

              in Saudi Arabia. McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Starbucks, and other U.S.

              lavish, comfortable and up to Western standards, whereas the women's 
              or families' sections are often run-down, neglected and, in the 
              case of Starbucks, have no seats. Worse, these firms will bar entrance 
              to Western women who show up without their husbands. My wife and

              Embassy in London):</a> &quot;Q: <strong> <b> <font color="#CC0000">Why 
              can women not travel freely and alone within Saudi Arabia?</font></b></strong> 
              A: This phenomena is not limited to Saudi Arabia. This custom prevails 
              in many Muslim countries. There is a religious basis for it: the 
              Prophet Mohamed said that no women should travel for more than one 
              night without her husband or a mahram, for example her father, son 
              or uncle. Some Muslim scholars believe that the Prophet's instruction 
              was based on the unsafe travel conditions of the time. They argue 
              that as travel is no longer risky, that injunction does not apply. 
              However, religious scholars in Saudi Arabia do not accept this interpretation, 
              and neither do the majority of the Saudi people. This is not a matter 
              of government decree; it is a matter of deep personal belief.&quot;</font></p>

              <font size="2">&quot;<font color="#CC0000"><b><strong>Muslim women 
              are required in Islam to cover themselves whenever they are outside

              men</a>. This provides many benefits to the Muslim woman herself 
              as well as to the society as a whole. Allah willing, I plan on discussing 
              many of these benefits in future articles. This article, however, 
              will simply describe the physical requirements of hijab. My hope 
              is that it will serve as a reference for Muslim women as well as 
              a basic introduction to hijab for non-Muslims. The word hijab is 
              derived from the Arabic root hajaba, which means to hide from view 
              or to conceal. Many people use it to refer to the headscarf which 
              Muslim women wear (as in: I bought this hijab for $10 yesterday), 
              but hijab is much more than a headscarf: it is an entire way of 
              dressing, behaving and believing. It is acceptable to name the scarf 
              hijab so long as it does not lead to the wrong impression that a 
              headscarf is the only requirement of true hijab. After all, anyone 
              can wear a headscarf (gypsies, fashion models, etc.), but it takes 
              much more than that to fufill the conditions of Islamic dress.<br>
              1. <strong><b><font color="#CC0000">Proper hijab (concealment for 
              the Muslim woman) dictates that the entire body must be covered, 
              although the face and hands may be exposed. Some women choose to 
              cover themselves further by means of a face veil and gloves, and 
              this is perfectly fine.</font></b></strong><br>
              2. The clothing must be long and loose-fitting so that the shape 
              of the woman is not outlined in her garments. The preferred coverings 
              include the jelbab and the abaya which are floor-length cloaks which 
              come in various types of fabric and may be worn over a woman's regular 
              house clothing. <a href="http://www.islam-qa.com/QA/5|Jurisprudence_and_Islamic_Rulings(Fiqh)/Al_Lib" target="_blank">Pants</a> 
              are unacceptable unless they are worn underneath the outer garments.<br>
              3. Garments should not be transparent as to reveal the color of 
              a woman's skin or to expose the hair or body in any way. With regards 
              to the headscarf, it must cover all of the hair and be long enough 
              to cover the woman's ears, neck and chest. Women should take care 
              to ensure that the scarf is securely fastened, usually with pins, 
              and that her hair is arranged so that it will not slip out of her 
              scarf.<br>
              4. Colors and styles should be as plain as possible so that unnecessary 
              attention is not drawn to the woman. In addition, the clothing should 
              not be excessively rich and fancy in order to gain admiration nor 
              excessively poor and ragged in order to gain sympathy. Modesty is 
              the main goal.<br>
              5. Jewelry must not be displayed, and it is especially important 
              that it does not make noise as a woman walks (an ankle-bracelet 
              with bells, for example). Women in pre-Islamic Arabia used to wear 
              such bracelets and stamp their feet in the markets in order to entice 
              and attract men.<br>
              6. The dress should not resemble the garments of men, nor should 
              it imitate the dress of non-Muslims.<br>
              7. Make-up (unless it is completely covered by a face-veil) and 
              perfume are strictly prohibited for Muslim women when outdoors or 
              in the presence of <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/reference/glossary/term.MAHRAM.html" target="_blank">non-mahrem 
              men</a>.<br>
              8. A Muslim woman who wears hijab should also strive to make her 
              actions consistent with her dress with regards to Islamic guidelines 
              for speech, manners and behavior.<br>

              </font></b></strong>Under the sharia, repeated theft is punishable 
              by <strong><b><font color="#CC0000">amputation of the right hand</font></b></strong>, 
              administered under anesthetic. Because of its severity, a number 
              of qualifications have been introduced to mitigate the punishment. 
              If the thief repents and makes restitution before the case is brought 
              before a judge, the punishment can be reduced; furthermore, the 
              victim can demand recompense rather than punishment or can grant 
              a pardon. Highway crime was considered a crime against public safety 
              and thus subject to more severe punishment. Aggravated theft can 
              be punished by cross-amputation of a hand and a foot. Such cases 
              have been unusual, but Amnesty International reported four of them 
              in 1986. In 1990 fewer than ten hand amputations took place, at 
              least five of which were administered to foreigners.<b><strong><font color="#CC0000">

              the skin was not broken. The purpose was to degrade rather than

              an infiltration of pagan Arabs who came at first as clients of the 
              Jews and ultimately succeeded in dominating them. Medina, or, as 
              it was known before Islam, Yathrib, had no form of stable government 
              at all. The town was tom by the feuds of the rival Arab tribes of 
              Aus and Khazraj, with the Jews maintaining an uneasy balance of 
              power. The latter, engaged mainly in agriculture and handicrafts, 
              were economically and culturally superior to the Arabs, and were 
              consequently disliked.... as soon as the Arabs had attained unity 
              through the agency of Muhammad they attacked and ultimately eliminated 
              the Jews.&quot; (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0192852582/qid=1045147797/sr=1-14/ref=sr_1_14/102-4210722-5583364?v=glance&s=books" target="_blank">Professor

              was a day when those words didn't invite cynicism. Since World War

              that too many inside the U.S. and Saudi governments have not yet 
              grasped that this old model was forever buried in the rubble of
