Saudi Arabia Opens World’s Largest University for Women by  Kristina Chew  May 29, 2011 1:55 pm  106 comments        Facebook Tweet     Reddit  StumbleUpon  Digg  E-Mail  Text Size:  A |  A |  A |  A    Saudi Arabia has opened the world’s largest university for women, the  Princess Nora bint Abdulrahman University . The new university is located on the outskirts of the Saudi capital of Riyadh and has the capacity for 55,000 students to study subjects including business and science. It also has its own teaching hospital, laboratories and libraries. All very good but, as the  Guardian observes, how many of those women who graduate will actually be able to work and use the skills they’ve learned, given that Saudi Arabia has the world’ strictest sex-segregation rules? Currently women, many of whom are well-educated, comprise only 15% of the workforce. The 2010 World Economic Forum global gender gap report in 2010 ranked Saudi Arabia 129 out of 134 countries and gave the country a zero for female political empowerment. Currently women cannot vote and must live under the control of a male guardian, usually a father or husband. They cannot get a job, travel or open a bank account with their guardian’s authority. They also cannot leave the house unattended or without wearing the niqab and cannot drive. The  Guardian quotes Nadya Khalife, from Human Rights Watch, about the new Princess Nora bint Abdulrahman University: “Ensuring women’s rights in Saudi Arabia is not about opening larger universities, it’s really about ensuring that women are allowed to study all fields and to be able to find future employment in these fields,” says Khalife. “The way in which Saudi Arabia segregates men and women in employment makes it very difficult for women to enter certain jobs. The Saudi government made promises, for instance, about ensuring that female lawyers, who are allowed to work only in administrative jobs, take up court cases, but there still has been no decision. While the opening of a large university is an indication of Saudi’s interest in educating women, it has to do much more to lift restriction on women’s employment.” Two weeks ago, 32-year-old Manal al-Sharif, challenged the ban on women driving by videotaping herself driving and calling, via Facebook and other social media sites, for a “mass drive” of women on June 17th. An information technology specialist with the state-run oil company Aramco, Al-Sharif was arrested and imprisoned first for five days, and  now for 10 more . Al-Sharif is educated and used her knowledge of technology to start a protest, only to be immediately quashed down. But her driving a car and her call for a “mass drive” (the original page was taken down but there is a  replica of the Facebook event page ) — calls for Saudi women to have more freedoms that have been heard about the world — are examples of what can happen when women are, yes, educated.    Please sign    the petition    to release Manal al-Sharif and this    petition to end the ban    on women driving in Saudi Arabia.    Related Care2 Coverage  Manal al-Sharif Imprisoned For 10 More Days For Driving in Saudi Arabia     Read more:  education ,  manal al sharif ,  saudi arabia ,  sex segregation ,  university ,  voting ,  womens rights  Photo by  Emitron_68 .

I would not want the university to teach only courses pertaining to how-to-serve-men-better. If Chemistry is not offered from day one, then the government is up to something (Particularly organic chemistry - for it's oil based economy). It's hard enough to be a university educated female in America, I just can't imagine what it would be like in an Arab country. But it's a start and I am glad. My other comment is on the explosive hatred this has sparked in the comments. Wow, women's struggles in Saudi Arabia are going to be unimaginably difficult if this sentiment is what they are up against. I didn't realize the hatred was so intense. And now I suppose I will be insulted by the guy with the Ph.D. in insults: Gamal K. send a green star         Pamela D.    7:25 AM PDT on Jun 1, 2011  Let them lift their veils and see the world.

To start with: for example couple of the females (no need to say names or original countries ) you mentioned are defectors from their native countries for their personal agendas, as known records tell about them, who found a fertile place for islamophobes, whether in the US or elsewhere, to spread their anti-Islamic lies and distorted mindsets. They found in your likes (racist islamophobes) naive and perhaps, mentally distorted also, pupils to transmit their lies and heresy !...READ, IF YOU ARE CAPABLE OF READING, THE CLASSIC SERIES (20 volumes)ON "STUDIES OF HISTORY" by the 20th century British historian the renowned Dr. Prof. Arnold Toynbee, to learn something about Islam, Islamic-Arab civilization and their impact on western current culture and the rest of the modern world. This is just one CLASSIC source on Islam, among hundreds others. I DOUBT IF YOU CAN DO T send a green star         Mary P.    2:13 PM PDT on May 31, 2011  Tieney G , I totally agree with you. Islam is full of love, mercy and forgiveness. Judaism, Christianity and Islam are brother and sister Relligions. We all are One. You are on the right track. Love and Unite all human being. Look Past some Hate filled Individuals ; I actually pity them for it looks like They love to live a miserable life, filled with fear and hatred for those that They think they KNOW all, but in reality they know, absolutely NOTHING. Peace and love to all the beautiful people of this exquisit planet. send a green star         Gamal K.    1:42 PM PDT on May 31, 2011  To: the maniac racist called Drivin Russell, You sound like a sucker "KKK" under a false liberal cover. Bashing Islam (or any other religion) and repeatedly uttering anti-Arab slurrs, as most islamphobs here and elsewhere, are clear indicators of your low and racist rotten upbringing in a society built on genocide against the native Amerindians, slavery of abducted Africans, and above all on feeding bigotry and double standered. You are a miserable failure and a great liar about your shameful basic knoweldge in both arabic language (my ID does not mean CAMEL, you idiot!) and theology if you understand what it means. You claim to be a liberal and yet you have demonstrated the same Nazi characters and even worse to be anti-human racist!. Islamic culture/civilization and Arab muslims had taught your European ancestors (if you happened to be one of their offsprings raised in the usurped land of the Native Amerindians) in their dark ages how to be decent humans and knowledgable beings,,CAN YOU DENY THAT FACT , ISLAMOPHOBE RACIST!  send a green star         .    11:14 AM PDT on May 31, 2011  @Tierney G. So, Muslims may LIE with impunity (in fact, they're ENCOURAGED to do so by their religious "leaders") & WON'T tell you there're actually 2 Korans! Because Muslim/as may LIE about ISLAM to SUCKERS to ADVANCE it, to REALLY learn about Islam, read what its APOSTATES say about it & why they chose REAL FREEDOM & PEACE by LEAVING it! BRAVE, COURAGEOUS MUSLIM APOSTATES (ex: Rifqa Bary, Sergei Bourachaga, Nonie Darwish, Wahlid Shoebat, Ali Sina, Wafa Sultan, Amir Taheri, Ibn Warraq, etc. & REAL Muslim scholars like Tawfiq Hamid) have POSITIVELY INFORMED my understanding of I-Slam & are to be COMMENDED for their willingness to testify as to the GENUINE nature of the Shari'a (they've LIVED IT!) while facing STANDING DEATH-THREATS by ANY 'GOOD' Muslim/as! Also, the Koran is not compiled in ANY chronological order, so there's no real CONTEXT, tho' Muslims will LIE about THAT, too! K. 9:5 is in one of the LAST chapters in the Koran, tho' it's in sura #9 (this book's arranged with the LONGEST chapters set at the beginning & tapering down to the shortest, more or less)!
