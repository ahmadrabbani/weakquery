But a group of Saudi women has taken the controversial decree a step further in a new campaign to gain the right to drive in the ultra-conservative kingdom,  media reports say .   If they're not granted the right to drive, the women are threatening to breastfeed their drivers to establish a symbolic maternal bond. "Is this is all that is left to us to do: to give our breasts to the foreign drivers?" a Saudi woman named Fatima Shammary  was quoted as saying by Gulf News.      Obeikan argued in his decree that if the women give their drivers their breast milk, the chauffeurs would be able to mingle with all members of the family without having to worry about violating Islamic law. Some Islamic scholars frown on the mixing of unmarried men and women. Islamic tradition, or  hadith , stipulates that breastfeeding establishes a maternal bond, even if a woman breastfeeds a child who is not her own.    Drawing from the cleric's advocacy, the women have reportedly chosen a slogan for their campaign that translates to, "We either be allowed to drive or breastfeed foreigners." The current driving ban applies to all women in Saudi Arabia, regardless of their nationality, and it's been a topic of heated public debate in recent years.  The ban on driving was unofficial at first but was introduced as official legislation after 47 Saudi women drove cars through the streets of the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in 1990 in an attempt to challenge authorities.  The incident brought harsh consequences for the women, who were jailed for a day and had their passports confiscated. Many of them were said to have been forced to leave their jobs after the driving protest.  Still, every now and then, reports of Saudi women driving in defiance of the ban  emerge in the media . Two years ago, 125 women in Saudi Arabia  signed a petition that called on the Saudi interior minister to lift the ban. One of the Saudi female signatories, Wajeha Huwaider, posted a video of herself driving on YouTube in a direct appeal to the Saudi authorities to allow women to drive.  "For women to drive is not a political issue," Wajeha said as she sat behind the wheel. "It is not a religious issue. It is a social issue, and we know that many women of our society are capable of driving cars. We also know that many families will allow their women to drive."   --  Alexandra Sandels, in Beirut  Photo: Saudi women look under the hood of a new car at a showroom in Riyadh, where women sell cars to female buyers.

Posted by:  syed yasir mehmood |  March 15, 2011 at 10:47 PM    This is just unbeleivable. Comming from an Islamic background this is just embarassing. Remember a while ago one of the Saudi scholars issued a fatwa to kill Mickey Mouse? Think about it before you read any further for a moment. He issued a fatwa to kill a cartoon charactor? I mean does anyone else need any further examples of these intellectually bankrupt fatwa factories? The Quran orders to think and ponder. To logic and debate and if this comes out of their old rotton brains after thinking and pondering and logic, well what can i say these are the gifts of Wahabsim.    Posted by: Sayed |  March 15, 2011 at 09:17 AM    To Dear Gwenyth: may i ask hoe do u define freedom please???? you are calling the freedom to that system which mark an uncountable murders, rape, hacking, no-legacy (to-for women), the system who made up a women just a tool of sexual needs..? a bar dancer..? a public property..? a girl of next door..? dear Gwenyth you are speaking about which voice?? the voice which makes of no value to a modest, honorable and respected lady. the women who is respected as mother, sister, daughter, wife........ your freedom system called her just a shop product which can be sales and purchased like hot cakes... . . very very sorry if someone feeling my words harsh, bit these are not harsh. these are the words in respect of women either she is Muslim or non-Muslim... and as concern to lead to act to decide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, please read Quran (the revolutionary book) and see how many authorities a women have to lead, to act, to say, to decide and to choose. your sincere. syed yasir yasir783@yahoo.com   Posted by:  syed yasir mehmood |  March 15, 2011 at 06:56 AM    To syed yasir mehmood It is my understanding that these wonderful protections that women gain in exchange for freedom are generally mostly effective at protecting women from men of families of their own social standing or lower, not those of higher. The defense of the veil promises the backing of her family. If his family is greater, it provides little defense. And should her 'virtue' be compromised despite the veil, silence is often her best option, as informing people is likely to be a danger to her as much as to her assailant. I mean... 'She is given guards'? Sure, if her family is wealthy. Not true for the majority by far though. Such protections also do little to nothing to protect her from the predations of her family, a grouping that is often quite large. Since the majority of attacks(not just sexual, physical) on women even in more freely mixing countries are performed by close male associatives, including family, such a system falls very, very short. Not even mentioning the complete lack of protection afforded most women from the whims of their husbands. While most husbands will be kind most of the time I am sure, a 'what happens behind closed doors stays there' policy makes abuse very easy. As to "what religion, society, civilization or any law provides such securities/protections and rights?" I would say: Christianity, for most of it's history. Chivalry provided most of the protections you speak of in nearly identical ways, and modesty was held up as a high ideal. As women in Christian nations slowly got more and more of a voice, they more and more demanded freedom over the dubious protections of chivalry. Many women of Islam are trying to speak up, to have a voice, and are demanding greater freedom. -That- is what these women are doing, and to deny that fact and say 'women live well' is to ignore a central element in a good life. Freedom. To choose, to act, to lead one's one destiny. This is a desire I am sure you have, as most men do. It is a desire shared by many women too, including almost all who get a taste for it. I understand that many women of traditional Islam continue to stand in favor of the old ways. This is reasonable. Religion and tradition are powerful. And the way as it is has many benefits for some women. And change is frightening, better the devil you know than the one you don't. And finally, there is the possibility that they are looking to America as an example of the 'other choice' and are appalled. For which I really have trouble blaming them, we're pretty appalling. We're working on it. Maybe the women of Saudi Arabia, as they gain more of a voice, and become full actors on the global stage, can lend us a hand.   Posted by: Gwenyth |  March 07, 2011 at 12:29 PM    To those fools who look at this, scoff, and declare America far, far superior, keep in mind, we aren't really so far ahead. It wasn't so long ago that the laws favored men so drastically that women were little more than the property of the men in their lives. This -started to change about 100 years ago, but many of the advancements we enjoy in this regard are under 40 years old.  And in some Muslim countries, Some women's rights are actually more advanced than here. For instance, there are several countries where the Parliament has a preset minimum of a certain % of the seats be held by each gender, and similar statutes for political appointees exist. These are policies popular in many nations less regressive than the US.  In terms of many aspect of society overall, yes, the Middle East is fairly conservative overall. But compared to much of the world, -America- is extremely conservative. The manner that you look at Saudi Arabia is similar to how Europe looks at us. Finally, on the issue of women, it does remain true that in some ways women in America are restricted in freedom -culturally- in many persistent and pervasive manners. The hyper-sexualization of women, starting -much- earlier than girls can even begin to comprehend the implications, trapping women in a constant battle with the virgin/whore dynamic. The constant assaults on women's reproductive freedoms. The common, mild, almost background, virtually continuous sexual harassment by male friends, colleagues, acquaintances, and complete strangers. The very real threat of rape, affecting 1 in 6 women, making an estimated 1 in 30 men a rapist, possibly more.  Now, I personally wouldn't give up my even curtailed, assailed and treacherous freedom in exchange for the dubious protections of men who 'know what's best for me', and 'treat me like a queen', yet doesn't take -my- wishes into account, and treats me like a prized possession.  But don't act like -they- are primitive and -we- are so enlightened. The lines that divide us are thinner than you think   Posted by: Gwenyth |  March 07, 2011 at 11:53 AM    hi respected miss Marple: you might be right as per your knowledge BUTTT.......... in Islam a women is treaded as queen of the house, she is given guards as (father, brother, sons, husband) and having a good share in legacy from parents as well as husband. she is covered with cloth (veil) as her body is most precious and poise. taking in views all these her rights and her great status Islam settled some rules so that she can be prevent from brutes, dangers, unethical actions of society. you please tell me that which religion, society, civilization or any law provides such securities/protections and rights to a women like in Islam she having.    Posted by:  syed yasir mehmood |  March 07, 2011 at 06:50 AM    hi i would like to say that breast-feeding like this to the other people by Saudi women si not right,, i protest against it.. women have complete rights to work, education and business but in some Islamic limitations (safety measures ). so only children and their close eorking non-young boys could be have such maternal relation but not every body    Posted by:  syed yasir mehmood |  March 07, 2011 at 06:11 AM    how can I apply for driver job in saudi? may i mention arab muslim family with plenty of girls/women or maybe herem? BTW what do the muslim women in saudi eats or drinks? That will result the smell of saudi womens brestmilk.   Posted by: the horny driver |  January 15, 2011 at 08:50 AM    Let's be good to each other and not let religion dictate how we should live our lives. Let's bring up our children with good values and not let religion interfere in our lives. The world will then be a lot better.    Posted by: Alex |  November 02, 2010 at 08:57 AM    More importantly, why do these women - who are obviously not unintelligent - put up with living like that? Walking around in blazing heat covered in black garbage bags? Do they really believe that oppressive state depriving them of sun and air is somehow "holy?"   Posted by: No Dhimmi |  September 22, 2010 at 06:41 PM    REPLY. amza of course you do mean the fastest growing FORCED religion.   Posted by:  sam |  September 10, 2010 at 04:11 PM    I wish the saudi government would push these women a bit more so that they rebel. It has got to happen someday soon, they are living in a primitive society.   Posted by: Sally |  September 10, 2010 at 10:55 AM    Muslims Muslims what next !! Don't say you are going to make cheese out of your wives milk and feed it to strangers like some crazy sick Christians !!  http://www.wptz.com/news/22785527/detail.html    Posted by: Mohammad |  June 29, 2010 at 02:18 PM    I wonder If a preserved and original book can spell so much violence in the world...one pure book and more than 81 muslim sects ready to kill each other as to prove whose concept of Islam is correct...I wish Quran has also been a corrupt revelation ..then it might have scope tht we can sit across and make it more Humane....but when doors are closed Muslims will keep on killing Muslims..no matter if Quran is corrupt or not...Religions makes people deaf.dumb and blind..although most of them are harmless but who take it leterally gives the real face of Religion...so The concept God is a virus and religions are diseases ... Faster we get rid of these diseases better for the mankind...   Posted by: Bhuwan Pratap Singh |  June 29, 2010 at 03:33 AM    Hi come on, Burn all the fake religious books including the Bible. The Holy Quran is ONLY religious scripture that is preserved for more than 14 centuries in its pure and original form. Only Islam gives man and woman their rights. See the Christian West today; their nakedness; even to sell a fridge or a car they "sell" their mothers, sisters and daughters. Islam preserves the dignity and honour in its true and natural form.  Sheikh Obeikan; who is this Sheikh Obaikan, One nutty sheikh giving fatwas does not affect the TRUTH and the WORD OF GOD- THE HOLY QURAN. ISLAM IS THE FASTEST GROWING RELIGION IN THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY THE WEST AND AMONG THE WESTERNERS TOO THE MOST NUMBER OF PEOPLE ACCEPTING ISLAM ARE WOMEN !!!!!! YES, OPEN YOUR EYES AND READ THE QURAN TODAY - THE ONLY SALVATION FOR MANKIND. AMZA   Posted by: AMZA |  June 28, 2010 at 01:14 AM    Moe, you need to link up with Curly and Schimp to do a remake of the Three Stooges because you are so far out of touch to be in the last century. Women can't drive in Saudi but they can provide their breasts to adult drivers for bonding purposes? Besides being stupid, how is that safe? Saudi has too many clerics smoking funny weed. The women need to be able to make up their own minds. Period, end of discussion.   Posted by: Raj |  June 27, 2010 at 05:41 AM    The banning of women from driving is a cultural ban not religious ban. However, some of the comments here offensive and ful of ignorace. There are many Muslim countries that allow women to drive and work equal as men. Moreover, if we look at the women rights in the West/America, women make less money than men do and women are usually a naked meat for advertisements and comercials, being killed by husbands, boy-friends, rape etc. There are more crimes and unfairness against women in the West than in Middle East.  Do you say this women rights? No, as my openion, they are more like objects that have been used under the name of women rights.    Posted by: Moe |  June 26, 2010 at 02:36 PM    And what else do we expect from these Saudis ravishers and Wahabi extortionist. Bear the brunt now; for you were yourself the one to make them the icon and symbolism of perhaps a magnitude and the only attitude of Islamic silhouette. So nothing to be ashamed; fate is now reverting on you as Misyar (where one hires one as per desire for a month as one hence as picnic and fun) and similar Criminal fatwa’s of desire as this shit. Is there any one to utter and say hence negate these mockers prospering over mockery to defame Islam and Muslims. And you were the one to own their acts of bulldozing Jaanat ul Baqi and similar prestigious monuments hence unduly restricting world to see the realm OF Islam. So nothing especial; more to come; enjoy and scroll therefore to see the real face of crime against Islam and Muslim; this is through the hand of your handmade insignias and symbolic Icons. One must understand if the focus as final has no definition as single out submission, self sighted vision as the very same, results; for their decisions are their self desire and not the order as submission of God (SWT) desire and virtue. Thanks God (SWT)! I am a follower of Muhammad –o-Ale Muhammad (SAWAW). (Dr Raza)    Posted by:  Dr RazaHaider |  June 24, 2010 at 09:22 PM    Let's send Emily over there. I'm sure she drives like she reads. For such a conservative country, they sure don't mind loaning out their women's breasts....now every college kid will go.....milich bitte   Posted by: LaughingGoat |  June 24, 2010 at 02:21 PM    That's a good move - they're protesting. They could also go on strike in a number of different ways. Women have power, they need to figure out how to use it, but they'll have to be united. They're at least 50% of the population - and what do they have to lose? They don't have the freedom that a horse has, at the moment.
