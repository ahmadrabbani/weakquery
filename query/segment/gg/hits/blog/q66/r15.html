<p align="center" style="text-align:center"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">I
could not remain a Muslim because Islam hates women.&nbsp; I think I always
knew this, but as I got older that knowledge became more acute, Islam wants
women to cover themselves, to stay indoors, to obey men, however stupid those
men are.&nbsp; Islam says that women are inferior in every way.&nbsp; Islam
distorted my fathers feelings.&nbsp; He did not want us, his own daughters, to
be happy or fulfilled.&nbsp; He only wanted us to be good Muslims and for
daughters this means to be suffering Muslims.&nbsp; What sort of religion
forces fathers to make their daughters suffer?&nbsp; What sort of father thinks
that his daughters hair is shameful?&nbsp; What sort of father tells her she
cannot sing and dance when she is happy?&nbsp; A Muslim father.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p align="center" style="text-align:center"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">This
is why I am not a Muslim.&nbsp; My children, boys and girls, will be able to
feel the wind in their hair.&nbsp; They will not be ashamed.&nbsp; They can
sing and dance as much as they like.&nbsp; Nothing they do will shame me, as
long as it is done with life and joy.&nbsp; Islam has no joy.&nbsp; Islam is a
cult of tears and death</span></i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">.<br>

<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this web page, I
discuss the Islamic attitude toward women.&nbsp; This attitude can be divided
into the Islamic attitude toward infidel women and the Islamic attitude toward
Islamic women.&nbsp; I start with what Islamic sources say and then give
examples of how this is being put into practice in modern times.&nbsp; It is
important to keep in mind that not all Muslims think alike, and that there are
Muslims who are respectful of both infidel and Moslem women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">In a frontpagemagazine symposium (Gender
Apartheid and Islam, 12/30/04) Ali Sina argued with two apologists for Islam's
teachings on women, Ms. Julia Roach and Mohammad El Mallah.&nbsp; Mr. Sina
said:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:30.0pt;background:white"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black">Let us see what the Quran says about
women. It says&nbsp; men have a degree (of advantage) over them </span></i><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">2:228<span style="color:black"> ; that the witness of
woman is worth half of that of man </span>2:282<span style="color:black">; that
women inherit half of their male siblings, </span>4:11-12<span style="color:black">; that a man can marry two or three or four women </span>4:3<span style="color:black">; that if a women becomes captive in a war, her Muslim
master is allowed to rape her </span>33:50<span style="color:black">; that if a
woman is not totally submissive to her husband she will enter Hell </span>66:10<span style="color:black">; &nbsp; that women are tilth for their husbands (to
cultivate them)&nbsp; </span>2:223<span style="color:black">; that men are in
charge of women, as if women were imbeciles or minors who could not take care
of themselves; that they must be obedient to their husbands or be admonished
(verbally abused), banished from the bed (psychologically abused) and beaten
(physically abused) </span>4:34<span style="color:black">. &nbsp; </span></span><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:30.0pt;background:white"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black">These verses define the station of women
in Islam...</span><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:30.0pt;background:white"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black">Ms. Roach laments that Islam is not
practiced in all parts of the world by all Muslims to the standard prescribed
by Allah in the Quran.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:30.0pt;background:white"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black">For that we should give thanks to God.
Imagine if all Muslims were to stone or hang victims of rape or flog women for
minor offenses such as exposing a flock of hair. In fact, the countries that
practice Islam to its fullest are truly barbaric. Just think of the suffering
of the women in Afghanistan during the rule of the Taliban. Women were not
allowed to go out of their homes or work. Male doctors were not allowed to
visit female patients. So, when women became sick, there was no one to take
care of them and they died. The more a country becomes Islamic the more hellish
it gets.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:30.0pt;background:white"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black">Ms. Roach comforts herself by thinking
that after women die they can expect to be treated equally and says Women's
souls have equal value to those of Men's. In other words, what she is saying
is that while women live a life of slavery, abuse and deprivation in this world
they can rejoice because after they die they will be treated equally. Although
I find this a vacuous bargain, the truth is that even this promise is not true.
Women in Islam are not treated equally even in death.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:30.0pt;background:white"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black">Men are promised many virgins after they
die. What do women get? They get their old lousy husband to share with 72
voluptuous celestial virgins. With that many high-bosomed houries why would any
man want to spend a night with an old wife? Do women get also young celestial
studs to have orgies with? No they dont. They have to maintain their modesty
even after their death. The truth is that in Islam men and women are not
treated equally even after their death.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:30.0pt;background:white"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black">In fact, according to Muhammad few women
ever make it to Paradise . The majority of them end up in Hell. Let us see what
the Prophet says in this regards. This is where he describes his hallucinatory
visit to hell and paradise:&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p style="margin-left:30.0pt"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black">&quot;Then
I saw the (Hell) Fire, and I have never before, seen such a horrible sight as
that, and I saw that the majority of its dwellers were women.&quot; The people
asked, &quot;O Allah's Apostle! What is the reason for that?&quot; He replied,
&quot;Because of their ungratefulness.&quot; It was said. &quot;Do they
disbelieve in Allah (are they ungrateful to Allah)?&quot; He replied,
&quot;They are not thankful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favors
done to them. Even if you do good to one of them all your life, when she seems
some harshness from you, she will say, &quot;I have never seen any good from
you.' &quot; </span></i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Bukhari 7.62.125...</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:30.0pt;background:white"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black">She [Ms. Roach] also claims that a Muslim
woman has the right to sexual satisfaction within her marriage and clarified
that if a woman is unsatisfied she can obtain a divorce. Is that true? Under
the Sharia women are not allowed to divorce even if their husband beats them.
The decision to divorce rest only on man's whims. Now imagine a women going to
a Judge demanding divorce accusing her husband of impotency. How can you
humiliate the gigantic ego of a Muslim man and expect to live after that? She
will be a dead woman the next day. If she survives and manages to divorce, she
will be seen as a whore by everyone. A divorced woman has nowhere to go in the
Islamic world. I do not know whether Ms. Roach has ever lived in an Islamic
country. Muslim women are not allowed to have any libido. It is not pious for
women to have sexual feelings. In fact the genital mutilation is designed to
take away any sexual pleasure from them. Women are not supposed to enjoy sex.
If they have any libido, there is a risk that they may fornicate and commit
sin. Women must only provide satisfaction to their husbands and deny all their
own sexual needs. According to a tradition:&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:30.0pt;background:white"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black">Allah's Apostle said, &quot;If a husband
calls his wife to his bed (i.e. to have sexual relation) and she refuses and
causes him to sleep in anger, the angels will curse her till&nbsp;
morning.&quot;&nbsp;</span></i><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Bukhari
4.54.450<span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span></span><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:30.0pt;background:white"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black">It is hilarious to think that the angels
have nothing better to do than sit around and curse the poor woman all the
night for depriving them from watching the live porno show.&nbsp; If Allah must
punish woman for not satisfying the sexual needs of their husbands why does he
needs angels to lobby him for it? Isnt it a waste of angels resources? &nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:30.0pt;background:white"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black">In one sense this is all truly very funny.
But in another, much larger sense, it is a tragedy.</span>..<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:30.0pt;background:white"><em><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black">I think it is worth mentioning that in
Saudi Arabia if a person has been killed or caused to die by another, the
latter has to pay blood money or compensation, as follows:</span></em><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black"><br>

same in Islam. It depends on their gender and their religion. </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt"><br>
&nbsp; In the Koran (4.34) it is written:</span></p>
<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><em><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Men
are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the
other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women). So
good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded.
As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds
apart; and scourge (beat) them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against
them Lo! Allah is ever High Exalted, Great. </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the Koran,
Mohammed's teachings are included in the Hadith.&nbsp; Next to the Koran, is is
the most important part of Islamic law, its teachings are just as
binding.&nbsp; The following quotes from the Hadith are from the &quot;Sahih
Al-Bukhari&quot;.&nbsp; In volume 3:826 of Sahih Al-Bukhari Muhammed is quoted
as explaining why a witness of a woman is equal to half that of a man.&nbsp; He
said </span></p>
<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><em><span style="font-size:13.5pt">This
is because of the deficiency of the woman's mind.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This argument was <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=" 26543">caught on
tape</a> in Birminghams Green Lane Mosque.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><i><span style="font-size:14.0pt">Allah
has created the woman  even if she gets a Ph.D.  deficient. Her intellect is
incomplete, deficient. She may be suffering from hormones that will make her
emotional. It takes two witnesses of a woman to equal the one witness of the
man.</span></i><i><span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Arial"> </span></i><i><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Mohammed also quoted as saying that: </span></p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><em><span style="font-size:13.5pt">I
have not left any affliction more harmful to men than women 7:33</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp; The Koran commands men to beat women
who are disobedient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Sura 4:34 of the Koran says, </span></p>
<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><em><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Men
are the managers of the affairs of women . . . Those women who are rebellious 
admonish them, banish them to their couches, and beat them.&nbsp;</span></em><span style="font-size:13.5pt"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">In Tirmzi P439 we find:</span></p>
<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><em><span style="font-size:13.5pt">If
a woman's conduct is mischievous or immodest, the husband has the right to beat
her up (Tirmzi P439)</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; These religious commands of
Islam help us understand why Mohamed Kamal Mustafa, A prominent Muslim preacher
from Italy authored a book Women in Islam, in which he wrote that verbal
warnings followed by a period of sexual inactivity can be used to discipline a
disobedient wife. &nbsp; If that failed he said that according to Islamic law,
beatings could be then judiciously administered.&nbsp; &quot;The blows should
be concentrated on the hands and feet using a rod that is thin and light so
that it does not leave scars or bruises on the body.&quot; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These commands also
help us understand a Muslim web site titled <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3265684a10,00.html">How To Beat A
Wife</a> (5/1/05).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More Islamic commands in
regard to women are listed below.</span></p>
<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><em><span style="font-size:13.5pt">It
is forbidden for a woman to be seen by any man except her husband when she is
made up or well-dressed. (Tirmzi P 430) </span></em><i><span style="font-size: 13.5pt"><br>
<br>
<em>A woman is not a believer if she undertakes a journey which may last three
days or longer, unless she is accompanied by her husband, son, father </em><br>
<br>
<em>A woman must veil herself even in the presence of her husband's father,
brother and other male relations. (Tirmzi P 432) </em><br>
<br>
<em>She is forbidden to spend any money without the permission of her husband,
and it includes giving food to the needy or feast to friends. (Tirmzi P 265) </em><br>
<br>
<em>A wife is forbidden to perform extra prayers (NAFAL) or observe fasting
(other than RAMADAN) without the permission of her husband. (Tirmzi P 300) </em><br>
<br>
<em>If prostration were a legitimate act other than to God, woman should have
prostrated to her husband. (Tirmzi P 42 </em><br>
<br>
<em>If a man is in a mood to have sexual intercourse the woman must come
immediately even if she is baking bread at a communal oven. (Tirmzi P 42 </em><br>
<br>
<em>A woman who seeks KHULA i.e. divorce from her man, without a just cause,
shall not enter paradise. (Tirmzi P 440) A husband can divorce his wife at
will. </em><br>
<br>
<em>Majority of women would go to hell. (Muslim P 1431) </em><br>
<br>
<em>If a woman refuses to come to bed when invited by her husband, she becomes
the target of the curses of angels. Exactly the same happens if she deserts her
husband's bed. (Bukhari P 93) </em><br>
<br>
</span></i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">A woman in many ways is deprived of
the possession of her own body. Even her milk belongs to her husband.<em>
(Bukhari P 27) </em>She is not allowed to practise birth control either. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Ibn Masud reported, &quot;We
were fighting with the Messenger of Allah, and our wives were not with us. We
asked the Messenger of Allah, 'Should we castrate ourselves?' The Holy Prophet
forbade us from that, and then he allowed us Muta (temporary) marriage. So, we
all married wives for a fixed time (usually three days) for the dowry of a
piece of cloth.&quot; (Al Hadis, Vol. 2, p. 686)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here Mohammed clearly tells the Muslims to forget about the
prostitutes they had purchased for a handful of dates back home and to have fun
with these new victims who come even cheaper. They can be bought and violated
for only a piece of cloth. Allah is truly merciful! Praise be to Allah! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Among the more significant illustrations of
imitating (the unbelievers), and the most dangerous for Muslims, is the
enchantment of women. And this is among the traits of the unbelievers. The
intent of this is to bring (them) out of their nature, veil, and modesty so
that they could use it to tempt men. Because women desire the glamour of the
materialistic life, they are inclined to imitate, accommodate, and exaggerate
in all of this, because women were built to seduce and beautify themselves for
men. And men were built to desire a woman when she exposes (herself), and not
to desire her when she is modest and covering. [Document No. 47] The book adds
that, if Muslim women unveil themselves, the whole Muslim community will be in
peril:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">If they (Muslim
women) leave the principle of modesty and cover, this will be the road and the

<p style="margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:14.0pt">&quot;If you take
out uncovered meat and place it outside on the street, or in the garden or in

whose fault is it, the cats or the uncovered meat? <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:14.0pt">&quot;The
uncovered meat is the problem.&nbsp; If she was in her room, in her home, in
her hijab, no problem would have occurred.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.0pt">He said women were &quot;weapons&quot; used

<p style="margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:14.0pt">&quot;It is said

the West. One notorious example occurred in September 2004 in Denmark, when the
mufti Shahid Mehdi of the Islamic Cultural Center in Copenhagen <a href="http://www.cphpost.dk/get/82118.html">said on the Danish television

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&quot;When
a girl is raped by a man, since she is no longer a virgin, it is usually
believed that the best way to solve the problem is to get them married,
especially if the man is not already married.&nbsp; If the man is already
married and the raped girl is pregnant, this creates a more complicated
situation and usually ends in the girl's murder.&quot;&nbsp; The report
suggests that the practice of forcing rape victims to marry their attackers had
been partly reinforced by an earlier, but now obsolete, Turkish penal code.
This stipulated that if a rapist married his victim, his penalty would be
suspended and if he stayed married to her for five years, it would be cancelled
completely. The UN report, which is based on interviews with more than 250
people in Istanbul and other cities with large Kurdish populations, details
several such cases.&nbsp; One involved the rape of a mentally challenged girl.
&quot;The brothers of the girl offered her in marriage to the man and said that
they would pay all wedding costs, all in an effort to avoid gossip,&quot; the
report says. &quot;In the end, they shot the man dead. Later, they threw the
girl into a water channel. &quot;Somehow the girl was not hurt; she was saved
and then she was sent to another place through [social] organisations. However,
the family is still after her.&quot; </span></i><br>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">In
some parts of Pakistan, sexual assault  including gang rape  is officially
sanctified as a legitimate form of enforcing the social value system.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
One village council recently ordered that five young girls should be abducted,
raped or murdered for refusing to be treated as chattel. The girls were aged
between six and thirteen when they were married without their knowledge, to pay
a family debt.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And when Mukhtar Mais 12-year-old brother was alleged to have committed an
offence in a small Pakistani farming village, the village council ordered that
his sister be gang-raped. So, she was taken to a hut where four men repeatedly
assaulted her.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan there were 804 cases of
such officially orchestrated sexual assault in 2000, and 434 of these were gang
rapes. And if that isnt bad enough, the victims of these atrocities are then
expected to commit suicide because rape victims bring irreparable shame upon
their families.</span></i><span style="font-size:13.5pt"><br>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">The
number of rape charges in Sweden has tripled in the last twenty years.&nbsp;
Rape cases involving children under the age of 15 are six - 6 - times as common
today as they were a generation ago. Most other kinds of violent crime have
rapidly increased, too. Resident aliens from Algeria, Libya, Morocco and
Tunisia dominate the group of rape suspects... Lawyer Ann Christine Hjelm, who
has investigated violent crimes in Svea high court, found that 85 per cent of
the convicted rapists were born on foreign soil or by foreign parents.</span></i></p>
<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Some
Muslim immigrants admit their bias quite openly. An Islamic Mufti in Copenhagen
sparked a political outcry after publicly declaring that women who refuse to
wear headscarves are &quot;asking for rape.&quot; Apparently, he's not the only
one thinking this way. It is not as wrong raping a Swedish girl as raping an
Arab girl, says Hamid. The Swedish girl gets a lot of help afterwards, and
she had probably fucked before, anyway. But the Arab girl will get problems
with her family. For her, being raped is a source of shame. It is important
that she retains her virginity until she marries. It was no coincidence that
it was a Swedish girl that was gang raped in Rissne  this becomes obvious from
the discussion with Ali, Hamid, Abdallah and Richard. All four have disparaging
views on Swedish girls, and think this attitude is common among young men with
immigrant background. It is far too easy to get a Swedish whore girl, I
mean; says Hamid, and laughs over his own choice of words. Many immigrant
boys have Swedish girlfriends when they are teenagers. But when they get
married, they get a proper woman from their own culture who has never been with
a boy. Thats what I am going to do. I dont have too much respect for Swedish
girls. I guess you can say they get fucked to pieces.<br>
<br>
The number of rapes committed by Muslim immigrants in Western nations are so
extremely high that it is difficult to view them only as random acts of
individuals. It resembles warfare. Muhammad himself had forced sex (rape) with
several of his slave girls/concubines. This is perfectly allowed, both in the
sunna and in the Koran. If you postulate that many of the Muslims in Europe
view themselves as a conquering army and that European women are simply war
booty, it all makes perfect sense and is in full accordance with Islamic law.
Western women are not so much regarded by most Muslims as individuals, but as
&quot;their women,&quot; the women who &quot;belong&quot; to hostile Infidels.
They are booty, to be taken, just as the land of the Infidels someday will
drop, it is believed, into Muslim hand. This is not mere crime, but
ideologically-justified crime or rather, in Muslim eyes, attacks on Infidels
scarcely qualify as crime. Western women are cheap and offensive. We Muslims
are here, here to stay, and we have a right to take advantage of this
situation. It is our view of the matter that should prevail. Western goods,
like the land on which we now live, belong to Allah and to the best of men --
his Believers. Western women, too, essentially belong to us -- our future
booty.</span></i></p>

Mohammed gave a lecture in Sydney where he informed his audience that rape
victims had no one to blame but themselves. Women, he said, who wore skimpy

A few months earlier, in Copenhagen, Islamic mufti and scholar, Shahid Mehdi

not wear a headscarf were asking to be raped.<br>

Unfortunately, Western women are not the only victims in this epidemic. In
Indonesia, in 1998, human rights groups documented the testimony of over 100
Chinese women who were gang raped during the riots that preceded the fall of
President Suharto. Many of them were told: You must be raped, because you are
Chinese and non-Muslim.<br>
<br>
Christian Solidarity Worldwide reported that in April 2005, a 9-year-old
Pakistani girl was raped, beaten with a cricket bat, hanged upside down from
the ceiling, had spoonfuls of chillies poured into her mouth, and repeatedly
bashed while handcuffed. Her Muslim neighbours told her they were taking
revenge for the American bombing of Iraqi children and informed her they were
doing it because she was an infidel and a Christian.<br>
<br>
In Sudan  where Arab Muslims slaughter black Muslim and Christian Sudanese in
an ongoing genocide  former Sudanese slave and now a human rights activist
Simon Deng says he witnessed girls and women being raped and that the Arab
regime of Khartoum sends its soldiers to the field to rape and murder. In other
reports, women who are captured by government forces are asked; Are you

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">The
biggest social change entailed by this Islamization, Obin reports, is a
deterioration in the position of females. Teenage girls are forbidden to play
sports and are constantly watched by an informal religious police made up of
young men, sometimes their own younger brothers. Makeup, skirts, and
form-fitting dresses are forbidden; dark, loose trousers are the strongly
recommended attire. To go to the blackboard in front of a class, some Muslim
girls put on long coats. Often, they are forced to wear the headscarf, or
hijab, and forbidden to frequent coed movie theaters, community centers, and
gyms, or even to go out at all on weekends.</span></i><i><span style="font-size:14.0pt">..</span></i></p>
<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:14.0pt">Inevitably,
the report records rampant &quot;Judeophobia,&quot; to use the term in vogue in
France. Among even the youngest students, the term &quot;Jew&quot; has become
the all-purpose insult. .. Even more serious is the increase in assaults on
Jews or those presumed to be Jewish. Usually the assailants are Muslim
students. Sometimes the victims are, too: One Turkish high-school girl was
relentlessly harassed and bullied at school because her country is an ally of
Israel...</span></i></p>
<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:14.0pt">As
for history, Muslim students object to its Judeo-Christian bias and blatant
falsehood. They loudly protest the Crusades, and commonly deny the Holocaust.
Under the circumstances, many teachers censor their own material, often
skipping entire topics, like the history of Israel or of Christianity. The
report cites one teacher who keeps a Koran on his desk for reference whenever a
thorny issue arises. It cites Muslim students who refuse to use the plus sign
in mathematics because it looks like a cross. Field trips, especially to
churches, cathedrals, and monasteries, are boycotted...</span></i></p>
<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:14.0pt">Summing
up, Obin explains his disturbing findings as the result primarily of
indoctrination orchestrated over years by international Muslim organizations.
From an early age, students are taught what to think, what to believe, and to
regard their school teachers as liars. The goal of the radical groups seeking
to segregate Muslim communities and denouncing integration as oppression, Obin
writes, is to take the Muslim residents of France out of the French nation and
make them think of themselves as part of the international Muslim community.</span></i></p>

numerous death treats she received, including one from Van Gogh's killer. She
explains that most times the killers in honor crimes are the youngest males in

is quite convenient for the family. Therefore, Hirsi Ali suggests that the
whole family be judged for the crime, at least for complicity. Also according

Shariah court in London's Islamic community declared her guilty of
&quot;deliberately and maliciously bearing false witness against religious
sentiment and of willing treason against her Arab Muslim father's people and
against her nation, the Sudan.&quot; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Kola Boof was born in Omdurman,

savagery called infibulation, the clitoris, the two major outer lips (labia

and Silence (<a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=" 16191">frontpagemag.com

follows:</span></p>
<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt">The
impulse behind this savagery&nbsp;is clear: the hatred of women and the
terrifying fear of their sexuality. Demonizing female sexual desire and
pleasure -- and annihilating it -- becomes the priority. To successfully
achieve female genital mutilation, therefore, the mutilators have to legitimize
and institutionalize it. As a result, they socially construct the pathological
ideology that a girls genital area is dirty and, therefore, unacceptable. In
</span></em></p>
<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:14.0pt">Egypt<em>,
an uncircumcised girl is considered nigsa (unclean). The way she becomes
non-nigsa is to have her clitoris sliced off. In Sudan, the term used for getting
rid of the clitoris is tahur -- which means cleansing or purification...</em></span></i>
</p>
<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><em><span style="font-size:13.5pt">female
genital mutilation&nbsp;produces the oxygen that Islamic fundamentalism needs
to breathe. It helps militant Islam keep intact the foundation on which its
life depends: the subjugation and enslavement of women under a rigid system of
gender apartheid...</span></em><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><em><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Any
hint of opposition to mutilation&nbsp;is consistently met with furious
resistance from Islamic clerics, who fervently emphasize that female genital
mutilation&nbsp;is Allahs will and point to the Prophets sanctioning of
female circumcision in the hadiths to prove it. Umdat al-Salik, e4.3,
therefore,&nbsp;a manual of Shafi'i Islamic law, which&nbsp;is endorsed by
Al-Azhar University of Cairo, Egypt (the oldest and most prestigious university
in the Islamic world),&nbsp;states that circumcision is obligatory for both men
and women. </span></em></p>
<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt">The
prominent Egyptian Sheikh Mustafa Al-Azhari is one of the heroes of the
pro-mutilation movement. He has led the way by insisting, among other things,
that the attempt to stop female genital mutilation is a Western conspiracy
designed to spread promiscuity among Muslims. For him, the Egyptian medias
attempt to stop female circumcision is a crime. Surgical specialist at
Al-Azhar University, Dr. Muhammad Rif'at Al-Bawwab, meanwhile, puts it more
simply: the pleasure that women derive from the clitoris is simply just
unnatural and abnormal -- and leads to moral degradation.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; In Denmark, Imam Mustafa
Abdullahi Aden said that female circumcision was a religious duty.&nbsp; The
New York Sun writes that (11/14/02):</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp; Ironically Islamic theology which
preaches that women are trouble, makes women into an evil temptation to kill
the infidel, by preaching that men who die in Jihad or holy war will have
virgins in heaven.&nbsp; In the terror guide used by the hijackers who crashed

by Islam to incite violence was understood by Thomas Aquinas who in <i>Summa

combines truths with &quot;fables,&quot; twists the Old and New Testaments into
a &quot;fabrication&quot; of Mohammed's own, and seduces &quot;people by
promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh urges
us.&quot; </span></p>
<p class="storytext"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet Muslims see
themselves as moral and the West as corrupt when it comes to women.&nbsp; One
example of this outlook was the reaction of Muslims to a newspaper article
about an upcoming Miss World pageant to be held Dec. 7 02 in the Nigerian
capital, Abuja.&nbsp; Muslim groups say beauty pageants promotes sexual
promiscuity and indecency.&nbsp; A journalist, Isioma Daniel tried to defend
the pageant and wrote in the article:</span></p>
<p class="storytext" style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><em><span style="font-size:13.5pt">What would (the prophet) Muhammad think? In all
honesty, he would probably have chosen a wife from among them (the

<p class="storytext"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Come to think of
it he probably would have chosen all of them to be part of his harem but Isioma
didn't write that, I did.&nbsp; It's lucky I'm not a reporter in Nigeria.&nbsp;
In response to Isioma's article, violent demonstrators in the northern city of
Kaduna burned churches and rampaged through the streets.&nbsp; Angry Muslims
shouting &quot;Down with Beauty&quot; and &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot;, rioted and
stabbed and set fire to bystanders.&nbsp; About 175 people were killed
and&nbsp; injured.&nbsp; This continued until hundreds of soldiers were
deployed to restore calm and enforce a dusk-to-dawn curfew. (<a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/24hour/world/story/638717p-4836047c.html">fresnoBee.com

some Muslims in Britain also called for the event to be canceled.&nbsp; Sajjad

Corp. radio on 11/23/02.(New York Post 11/24/02) </span></p>

Gharam mamnuh, al Gharam kufr,&quot; screamed the self-declared cleric in al

were not questioning the commercialization of romance, but inquiring about
the ban on being in love. The scholars said human love is evil. The simple
feeling of being attracted to or in love with someone is a terrifying sin if it
is committed outside of dogma. And it warrants serious punishment. </span></em><i><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:black;background:white"><br>

<em>Al Hub (basic love) -- said one of the scholars online -- is not
permissible outside commitment to Jihad. The subject was new, overwhelming to
the al Qaida sympathizers who were dodging the decadent feeling. </em></span></i></p>

<em>Lebanons TV has taken the freedom for love to sophisticated artistic
expressions. With shows seen by millions, the LBCI has been shaking off the
fundamentalist quarters of the region. On al Jazeera,&nbsp;clerics are

Perhaps the greatest abuse of Islam towards women is turning them into
extremist suicide bombers.&nbsp; According to Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir,
who has interviewed bin Laden, there is a ready supply of female jihadists in
his country alone who would be thrilled to help al Qaeda. (<a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=" 20281">Veiled
