It has a buttery goodness that many restaurants cannot achieve. This recipe was created out of need after I moved to an area that doesn't have a Chipotle within walking distance (like everywhere else I've lived!). After much trial and error, I've got the right one.  I tasted this side by side with Potle's guac and they are very, very close. You may want to back the Kosher salt down a bit to between a third and half teaspoon if you prefer guac that's less salty than Chipotle's. Keep in mind that the salt brings out the avocados taste, so if you back off only do it in minute amounts. Taste, then add more salt if needed. This recipe makes enough guac for 2-3 people to enjoy with chips or in their tacos. All of the measurements are in easy to scale numbers, so making a lot of guac is easy. I also tested this recipe with ten avocados and multiplied all of the other ingredients by five and it came out perfectly.  Just be sure to follow the steps outlined below. The order of the steps is what gives the guac its balance and creaminess.  Difficulty: Easy  Instructions   Things You'll Need  2 large Haas avocados  2 tbsp. diced red onion  2 tbsp. chopped cilantro  1/2 tsp. kosher salt  1 tsp. lime juice  2 tsp. diced jalapeno   Suggest Edits   1   Image courtesy of Darwin Bell via Flickr.  Prepare all of the items before starting. Dice the onion, jalapeno, and cilantro before you start. If the avocados sit in their mixing bowl while you are prepping everything else, their meat will begin to oxidize and turn brown.    2   Add a banana peel to ripen avocados faster.

To remove the seed, stick the heel of your knife into it and give it a quick turn to free it. Be careful you don't stick the knife in your hand! Scoop the meat out of the fruit into a mixing bowl. *Picking avocados* Picking the right fruit for this recipe is critical. They HAVE to be Haas avocados, if they are anything else, you won't achieve the creamy, buttery flavor. When picking an avocado, make sure it is ripe. When squeezing the fruit they should not be hard, but firm with a little give. Picture yourself cutting the avocado when buying it. If it feels like the pit would just fall out as soon as you open it, it's too ripe. If it feels like you will have a hard time getting the pit out, it's not ripe. *Ripening avocados* If you're making guac in the time of year when ripe avocados aren't around, there is hope. Start by buying the fruit two days in advance, along with a banana. When you get home, eat the banana and put the peel and the unripe avocado into a paper bag and let them sit together for at least a full day. The gas expelled by banana peel will speed up the fruits ripening process.    3   Image courtesy of Qfamily via Flickr  Add the cilantro and mash together. Since the cilantro is a much lighter weight than the other ingredients mashing it with the avocados in this step will make sure that it gets an even mix. Another benefit of mashing the avocados now and again with all the other ingredients is it improves the smoothness of the finished product.    4 Add the rest of the ingredients and mash again until smooth and creamy. Once it is the desired texture, give it a taste and add more salt or lime juice as needed. Enjoy!         Photo Credit Image courtesy of Gaetan Lee via Flickr.
