First-quarter net income at the Denver-based  company grew to $46.4 million, or $1.46 per share, compared with $37.8 million, or $1.19 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected the company to  report a profit of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 24 percent to $509.4 million. Sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 12.4 percent, fueled by an increase in customer visits. Restaurant level operating margin was 25.2 percent for the first quarter, down 70 basis points from the prior quarter and down 90 basis points from the prior year. The company attributed the fall to higher food and promotional spending. In March, Chipotle co- Chief Executive Monty Moran said the company expected to see an extra 20 to 30 basis points of near-term labor costs related to replacing Minnesota workers who were fired after an audit by  U.S . Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). During the winter, Chipotle fired 450 undocumented workers in Minnesota. ICE also is auditing Chipotle restaurants in Virginia and  Washington , D.C., where dozens of illegal workers recently have been terminated. Chipotle said it now expects 2011 same-restaurant sales growth in the mid-single-digit percentages. It previously had called for a low-single-digit percentage gain in 2011 same-store sales. Chipotle's shares fell to $282.18 in after-hours trading after closing at $288.10.
