However, it was a  gospel song performed at the show that unexpectedly crossed all boundary lines and created a viral sensation over the weekend.  Carrie Underwood was just one of many huge names in the allstar lineup, but her duet with  Vince Gill of the classic standard "How Great Thou Art" managed to bring down the entire house--and internet, at that. According to Yahoo! data, searches for Underwood's rendition of the tune spiked a whopping 362% on Saturday.     If that weren't enough, the video of the performance has received nearly a million views, and has drawn extraordinarily high praise--with comments ranging from "Wow! God was in the house," "I am not a Christian but this is truly beautiful," "She﻿ is an angel" to "This is the most moving version of that song I﻿ have ever heard," "She rocks 'em and socks 'em," "I'm speechless." One user even went where most dare not tread, and compared Underwood to  the King himself--"I thought that nobody could come close to singing this song like  Elvis did during his﻿ concerts. I was wrong, Carrie put her heart and soul into this amazing version!"   Underwood and Gill's fellow stars in the audience appeared moved by the performance, as well.  Martina McBride stares transfixed at the stage, the ordinarily humorous  Blake Shelton and  Miranda Lambert watch reverently, while  Sugarland 's Kristian Bush nods his head and Jennifer Nettles mouths "What a voice."     After hitting the final, climactic notes, Underwood wrapped the powerful performance up with a hug for Gill. Then, she wiped away a few tears...and faced a standing ovation from her peers. How great, indeed.    As always, be sure to:  Follow me on Twitter    Follow Yahoo!

Albert P    2 weeks ago   great music  GOD BLESS           Caesar    2 weeks ago   God is indeed Great, and his power and greatness are beyond human understanding and discription. Consider this small example of his greatness (Huumility/ Power) : Just by saying/thinking, these 4 very simple and short words; "Let There Be Light" (the Big Bang), He released an energy roughly equal to 1 followed be 60 zeros (1 trillion multiplie by a Trillion 5 times) Kilo Tons of TNT, which of course became the Universe we live in. To show his humility, he spent time with us on earth in this way: He was born in a stable and when he was leading and teaching his apostles, he washed their feet and finally he left this world in the most degrading and painful way, by the Cross. God is infintely humble and powerful!           Chris    3 weeks ago   Chillingly Awesome           bill    3 weeks ago   out of this world           wendy m    3 weeks ago   Every song she sings.
