My co-host Brad Paisley is a distinguished songwriter, singer, guitarist, a true humanitarian and the newly published author of   Diary of A Player  . (He paid me handsomely for the book plug.) He's also the single biggest and most shameless wiseacre on either side of the Mason-Dixon line. Don't believe me? Just watch.  Miss Piggy -- with whom I competed fiercely at the host auditions this year -- has it out for me, I'm pretty sure. I caught her rehearsing "Remind Me," in her dressing room. I'll have to keep my eye on her.   The hysterical and Emmy-winning Eric Stonestreet will come to Nashville to reclaim part of the  Modern Family timeslot. That's my second favorite show on TV after  The Walking Dead . But that's on another network, so forget I said that.   What other show would bring you Taylor Swift, Lionel Richie, The Band Perry, the stars of  Once Upon A Time , Kenny Chesney, Lady Antebellum, World Series MVP David Freese, Jason Aldean, and a few people who I can't mention yet for legal, moral and musical reasons.   Country music is cool and the show is free. And the price is the same for the whole family.  There will be a moving tribute to the legendary Glen Campbell featuring there of our finest guitar-slinging singers of all time -- Vince Gill, Keith Urban, and Brad.  The amazing Faith Hill is singing on the CMA Awards for the first time in five years.   Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert will both be there too. Just between us, I'm beginning to suspect there's something going on between them.  There will be some big surprises, but no, I can't tell you. Trust me -- don't tune in late!   Carrie Underwood co-hosts "The 45th Annual CMA Awards" -- Country Music's Biggest Night that airs live from Nashville Wednesday, November 9 at 8PM/7PM Central on ABC.            Read more from Huffington Post bloggers: Rose-Lynn Fisher  Rose-Lynn Fisher: The Jayhawks: On Wings of Reunion      Rose-Lynn Fisher: The Jayhawks: On Wings of Reunion   On a purely objective note, I was curious to know more about the band itself, a group of boomers who are still rocking and rolling. I wanted to know how they've achieved their balance of staying power and freshness.                           Loading...               Loading...

I think Underwood is a great inspiratio ­n for girls and am pleased she continues to host. We need more positive influences up there. With that being said, I don't read a crystal ball I hope she sticks to who she is and think she will but onr never knows.     skibum415: It seems with each passing year the Country Music Awards http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/skibum415/ten-reasons-to-watch-the-_b_1082320_117369765.html  History   |   Permalink   |  Share it            HUFFPOST SUPER USER tdpubs Content publisher for small business marketing  569 Fans           03:34 PM on 11/09/2011  I don't watch award shows but I'm a big fan; my wife is too.

The show producers don't understand their target audience or what people want. Country music is becoming extinct because it's from an older age, a bygone era of our evolution as a society. The show producers think they can attract more audience (and sponsors) by broadening the art. That's like asking Pablo Picasso to use water color so he can market to children. I don't like : The rappificat ­ion of all music - rap and hip hop have its venue and its place in music it doesnt work with country, kinda like mustard doesnt go well with icecream. The new techno assisted elevator country. If you sing about how your 16 year old boyfriend doesnt understand you doesnt make it a ballad or country. Here's a hint and a clue for country music awards shows : we like Hank Williams, Tammy Wynette, Glenn Campbell, Waylon Jennings, Charley Pride, Ray Pierce.... ­...THATS country stuff.  Need to get back to your roots. I miss those guys and gals. Todays "stars" are too busy being stars on big fancy ranchs with flashy stuff instead of being authentic. You can't sell authentic country and live in a mansion or a ranch the size of oklahoma.
