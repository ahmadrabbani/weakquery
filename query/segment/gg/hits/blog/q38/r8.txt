For us,  Carrie Underwood is almost always the highlight of any country music affair, so when she took the stage at the Academy of Country Music Awards on April 3, it seemed like the night was bound to peak just a bit too soon.  Then  Steven Tyler strutted on stage, and it was official.  Tyler joined Underwood for the second half of her song "Undo It," before the two  "American Idol" stars tackled the duet to end all duets: "Walk This Way."  The singing? Fantastic. The synchronized moves? Adorable. Tyler's persistent attempts to get a kiss from Underwood? Comedy gold. Only Carrie Underwood could fend off the big-lipped-one's pleas for smooches in front of millions and not even break a sweat.

NN | April 3, 2011 10:47 PM   ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! I hope it's available on i-tunes. Jailor | April 3, 2011 10:59 PM   that was a great performance, no doubt, but for a county awards show? why? jjfromnyc | April 4, 2011 12:06 AM   Carrie is a good, accomplished singer...but she sounds predominantly country (not Rock!) on EVERY song she sings. No thanks. Um, no | April 4, 2011 6:00 AM   She's supposed to sound country. She's a country singer. A collaberation is about bringing yourself to something else, not becoming it. It was supposed to be a country/rock version of "Undo It" and "Walk This Way" - which it was. So, it was what it was supposed to be.
