The day that my grandpa died i turned on the radio and it was the first song i hurd, then the day of his funral i hurd it on the way to the service and on the way to the graveyard. And the funny thing is that my grandpa always told me that this is our temporary home and i never belived him untill the day he died.

This song reminds me sooo much of one of my best friends brother who reciently passed away in a four-weeler accident. His birthday was on halloween, and i was walking around in the hallways before school started with all my friends while shuffling through the songs on my ipod. As soon as this song came on i started to cry. I miss u ryan ;( R. I. P. Ryan!! I love u!!!            by   amydaisy220  on  May 8th 2011    2:10 am    Share          This song reminds me of my granpa who just pass away and when everytime i sing it i will cry.           by   candace29  on  May 2nd 2011    4:19 am    Share          This song really inspires me in a way that it tells about how life has ups or downs but we can say it's like your temporary home...            by   PeaceMusicLover123  on  Apr 30th 2011    2:12 pm    Share          This song is very good. The saddest part was "old man, hospital bed. " it reminds me of my grandfather, who passed away from a heart attack. It makes me cry, and i can see him saying, "this isn't my temporary home, i've found where i belong. " when you are living your full life, its your temporary home. You can never find the place you are meant to be, until you pass away. He was in the military services, so he is a proud man we should be thankful for. You need to live your life as long as you can, you can never be sure when you find your beloved people who passed away! "be thankful for what you have, not what you lost.
