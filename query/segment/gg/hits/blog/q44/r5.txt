And if they're looking for controversy, it could definitely be the perfect choice for NBC. According to  The Wall Street Journal , shock jock Howard Stern is in talks to join "America's Got Talent" as the replacement judge for CNN host Piers Morgan, who  announced Wednesday night that he would be leaving the multi-talent competition. Stern broadcasts his Sirius XM show on a limited basis; he began broadcasting for the satellite station in 2006 after years amassing listeners and fines with equal proficiency. He's one of the richest radio broadcasters in history, and is reportedly in talks for a $15 million contract.  Whether or not he'll bring Fartman to the proceedings remains to be seen.

He's one of the most piercing interviewe ­rs I've ever heard, he can get anything out of anyone, and he'll be honest about his judgement.

About 1% is smutty, he is the best interviewe ­r I've heard. He gets more out of people than a Barbara Walters. For those of you who think he will ruin the "all American" show. You had no problem with Hasselhoff ­, who thinks its ok to get pass out drunk in front of his kids and Sharon Osbourne as in Ozzie's wife, you remember she threw a ham into her neighbors yard screaming "$%ckers". Stern is a huge fan of the talent show and he wouldn't be Howard the shock jock but he would give honest opinions. I think he would be terrific but unless it's filmed in NY doubtful he will do it.
