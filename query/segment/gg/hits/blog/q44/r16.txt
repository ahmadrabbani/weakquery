There may be an app for him. The radio shock jock,  who recently hinted  that he will leave his current perch at  Sirius XM when his contract expires in December, is considering taking his show to the internet,  reports the New York Daily News.  Stern thinks that he could produce his show as a subscription based podcast. "With the new phone technology, it's ridiculously easy, said  Kurt Hanson of the Radio and Internet Newsletter. "More and more people are doing it. If a Stern got into it, that would speed acceptance further." Stern, 56, has said that he wants to work less than he currently does, which is four days a week, 39 weeks a year.

It's not clear if he could make anywhere near that amount with an app-powered show. But his star power could make it possible. "The problem with 'monetizing' the Internet is that almost everything there is available somewhere else, free," said  Michael Harrison of  Talkers magazine . "Stern would be selling something not available anywhere else - himself," he said. A projection by the News showed that Stern could land $60 million a year if he charged $5 a month with a million subscribers, both figures the paper considered to be on the low end of the spectrum.
