What was the most shocking part of Stern's announcement?  He actually took the time to read for the contract for himself, thinking it might impress his wife.   The WSJ online reported : The announcement was made live on the air by Mr. Stern during his Thursday-morning show, with his usual flair for putting his neuroses on display. He claimed that the new contract was the first such document he had ever personally read—and that he did it ostentatiously in front of his wife, hoping to make a positive impression on her. After the radio host complained that his gambit was unsuccessful, his wife, Beth Ostrosky, called in and told him she hadn't realized she was supposed to be impressed. That's a new spin on the duty to read. [Meredith R.
