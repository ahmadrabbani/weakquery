And what exactly will Bono have to say about letting the Mirror Ball trophy slip from his hands? You'll have to tune in to find out. "Howard and his audience have always supported Chaz," an insider told me. "As outrageous as Howard is, he has always been a friend of the gay, lesbian and transgender community. He thinks Chaz is cool and can't wait to talk with him tomorrow." Chaz is stepping back into the public spotlight -- although this time it won't be with a quickstep -- to promote his new documentary, "Being Chaz," which premieres Nov. 27 on Oprah Winfrey's OWN network. "Being Chaz" is a follow-up to the hugely successful "Becoming Chaz" which followed Cher's son throughout the process of physically becoming a transgender man. "Chaz is a shy guy but has found a lot of confidence since doing 'Dancing with the Stars,'" a friend of his tells me. "He never wanted to be the poster child for the transgender community but is handling all the attention very well. If he can help change the mind of one person or make life better for one teenager then he will, even if that means subjecting himself to the questions of Howard Stern."

Internatio ­nal Human Rights Law The Yogyakarta Principles ­, which is a document on applicatio ­n of internatio ­nal human rights law, provides definition on gender identity. In the preamble, "gender identity" is understood to refer to each person's deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person's sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modificati ­on of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender , including dress, speech and mannerism. Further, in Principle 3, that each person's self-defin ­ed gender identity is integral to their personalit ­y and is one of the most basic aspects of self-deter ­mination, dignity and Freedom. These Principles influenced the UN declaratio ­n on sexual orientatio ­n and gender identity.     crunchie: It would not boggle your mind so much if you http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/crunchie/howard-stern-chaz-bono-being-chaz_n_1092696_118248441.html  History   |   Permalink   |  Share it       There are More Comments on this Thread.
