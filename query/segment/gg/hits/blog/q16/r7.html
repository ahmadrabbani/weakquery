						<font face="Arial">It is unfortunate that not many more scholars are 
			willing to confront this topic with honestly and integrity. That's 
			because there is academic bias on campus. Muslim students will 
			protest violently and try to get teachers fired. Liberal professors 
			commit the crime of denial by ignoring how much violence and 
			destruction Islam has caused around the world. Islam has been 
			successful in completely wiping out many middle eastern cultures and 
			languages and replaced them with the pagan religion of Islam that 
			requires its made up, nonsense-filled, holy book (Koran/Qur'an) only 
			be read in a language most don't even understand --the language of 
			Arabic. <br>
			<br>
			Muslims destroyed Jewish synagogues, Christian churches &amp; Hindu 
			Temples all over the world, in their zeal to convert the entire 
			world to Islam. <br>
			<br>
			In retrospect, the Crusades were a good thing. They probably allowed 
			the western world a thousand years of freedom from the diabolical 
			Islamic religion. They stopped the expansion of the Islamic empire. 
			This allowed Christianity to prosper in Europe which preserved the 
			gospel for the rest of the world to receive. Christians should never 
			apologize for the the Crusades, because these were a reaction to the 
			Muslim crusades against the entire world. In the 7th century the 
			Muslims took control of Jerusalem, and in the 11th century they 
			began to hassle, kill, molest Christian pilgrims in the Jerusalem 
			area. The Crusades were also in response to the cries of help from 
			the eastern Byzantine Empire, which was very worried about the 
			military threat to it from the Seljuk Turks. So if the Christians 
			did not respond, the Muslims would have conquered all of Europe and 
			wiped out Christianity from the planet. Today we would all be bowing 
			to Mecca instead of worshipping Jesus.</font><br>
