									<h2>Cartoons, Muhammad &amp; Europe</h2>
<h3>Muslims finally speak out</h3>
<p align="justify">Westerners have complained that Muslims around the world have 
been largely silent about the Islamic terrorism, such as the events of 
9/11, the bombings in Spain, London, Bali, etc… When the beheadings of 
Westerners were broadcast on Arab TV channels, there wasn’t much of a response. 
Now, they are demonstrating in the streets, burning down embassies, threatening 
murders, and desecrating national flags.
<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004448.htm">In Their Own Words</a> 
shows photographs of them expressing their threats and hatred. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">What has happened that is so despicable, so offensive, so as to cause Muslims worldwide to speak out so angrily? Why have Western leaders continued to repeat the mantra, Islam is a religion of peace? Do they suppose 
it will soothe our anxiety as we see screaming masses threatening to harm us? Why have Western TV stations exercised self-censorship and have not shown us the 
basis of this headline news story? The answer is that Muhammad is depicted in some cartoons! Most Western news organizations have deferred to the sensitivities of Muslims, saying they 
<b>respect</b> Islam, when, in reality, they <b>fear </b>it.</p>
<h3>Cartoon Background</h3>
<p align="justify">It is surprising that Muslims were shocked over the cartoons that played upon the relationship between Muhammad and terrorism. After all, before going on their missions of terror, Muslim suicide bombers read the Qur’an and pray. These Muslims view their missions as religious acts to attain virginal paradise and to terrorize those whom they believe are the enemies of Islam. Naturally, non-Muslims make the religious connection between Muhammad and terrorism, because this is exactly the connection that Muslims 
themselves make.  Not surprisingly, Europeans have depicted this connection in their cartoons.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">&quot;I am with you: give firmness to the                                           Believers: I will instil <strong>terror</strong> into the                                           hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye                                           above their necks and smite all their                                           finger-tips off them.&quot; &hellip; Against them                                           make ready your strength to the utmost                                           of your power, including steeds of war,                                           to strike <strong>terror</strong> into (the hearts of)                                           the enemies, .. Sura Al-Anfal 8:12, 60                                           (Yusuf Ali&rsquo;s translation)
	<font face="Verdana"> <a href="#reference1" name="reference 1" id="reference 1"><sup>1</sup></a></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> European Muslims have political clout far   									beyond their numbers, because they can bring   									the Muslims 
from around the world to their cause. Many don&rsquo;t know that the Danish   									Muslims sent a delegation to the Muslim   									leaders of the Middle East to show them a   									43-page dossier on the published cartoons.   									(See <a href="http://islamonline.net/English/News/2005-11/18/article02.shtml"> Danish Muslims &quot;Internationalize&quot;   									Anti-Prophet Cartoons</a> and <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/09/news/mecca.php"> How rage built: The cartoon trail to Mecca</a>.   									An English translation of the dossier is   									available on the <a href="http://counterterror.typepad.com/the_counterterrorism_blog/files/danish_letter.pdf"> Counterterrorism Blog</a>.) &nbsp;In addition to   									the cartoons that appeared in the <em> Jyllands-Posten,</em> the Danish Imams added   									fabricated cartoons to their dossier to   									incite their Middle Eastern friends. Kaare   									Quist reported in <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,398624,00.html"> Spiegel Online</a> that &ldquo;the dossier   									included three obscene caricatures &mdash; one   									showed Muhammad as a pedophile, another one   									as a pig and the last one depicted a praying   									Muslim being raped by a dog.&rdquo; These   									fabricated cartoons are under investigation.   									(See

<h3>Did the Imams Insult the Prophet Muhammad?</h3>
<p align="justify"> The <em>Muhammad Pig Face</em> cartoon   									outraged multitudes of Muslims. However, the <em>Muhammad Pig Face</em> illustration was   									really an alteration of a photograph of   									Jacques Barrot performing in the French   									Pig-Squealing Championships in   									Trie-sur-Baise&#39;s annual festival. MSNBC   									carried the story August 5, 2005 in an   									article entitled, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8959820"> Duo hogs top prize in pig-squealing contest</a>.   									The article, <a href="http://www.neandernews.com/?p=54"> Danish Imams Busted!</a>, compares the <em> Muhammad Pig Face</em> cartoon to the <em> Pig-Squealing Contest</em> photograph. The <a href="http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/775"> Cartoon Hoax</a> article discusses the   									Imam&rsquo;s deception further. If the Brussels   									Journal&rsquo;s premise is correct, the Danish   									Imams used deceitfulness to incite hatred   									among their Middle Eastern co-religionists.&nbsp;   									You can make up your own mind if the <em> Muhammad Pig Face</em> cartoon is an   									alteration of the <em>Pig-Squealing Contest</em> photograph by comparing the two images   									below.</p>

<p align="justify">The Brussels Journal wonders whether Muslims will demand the 
execution of the Danish Imams because they insulted Muhammad with a pig&#39;s face? 
While news reports focus on the violent riots, little attention is given to the 
role of the Imams in fomenting Western hatred. Imams use <i>humiliation</i> and <i>victimization</i> as an excuse to blame the West — rather than Islam itself 
— for their cultural, economic, and scientific backwardness. Moderate Muslim journalists in Jordan and Yemen have been arrested and are sitting in jail even though they apologized for printing the cartoons.<sup><font face="Verdana"><a href="#reference2" name="reference 2" id="reference 2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Muslim&rsquo;s Hypocritical Standard</h3>
<p align="justify">Muslims have always enjoyed demeaning and hateful cartoons as 
long as the ridicule was on someone else. Anti-Jewish cartoons are a source of 
endless entertainment for the Muslim masses. Cartoons on Muslim TV programs ridiculed Jews as apes and pigs.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a> is a fraudulent document that is depicted as authentic in Saudi Arabia textbooks. Teaching Muslim children the truth is not as important as indoctrinating hatred in Saudi Arabia. If respect is important to Muslims, then they should show respect to non-Muslims and their religions. Respect is not a one-way street. <em>When churches and synagogues can be built and attended freely in Saudi Arabia, then we will know that 
Islam is a tolerant and respectful religion. </em>They might start 
by allowing the scriptures of the holy prophets to be publicly sold there.</p>
<p align="justify">These Muslim cartoons are no accident because the Qur’an itself demeans Jews, Christians, and pagans. It calls them apes (2:65), swine (5:60), asses (74:50), dogs (7:176), and cattle (7:179). Their holy book uses this derogatory and demeaning language.  So, it is not surprising that during Hajj Muslims find it spiritually acceptable to curse America. See Hajj video <a href="http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/991.htm">Iranian Pilgrims in Mecca Shout &quot;Death to America, the Great Satan&quot; in an Anti-American Rally</a>. </p>
<p align="justify">Saudi Arabia spends millions of dollars to spread Islam around the world.  At the same time, they won’t allow a single church, synagogue, or temple to be built anywhere within 
its borders. Some Western universities welcome the advance of Islam because they receive millions of Saudi dollars. (See article <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00E16F935550C708DDDAB0994DD404482"> Saudi Prince Gives Millions To Harvard and   									Georgetown</a>.)&nbsp; Yet, Saudis jail   									non-Muslims who have private prayer meetings   									in their own home. (See article <a href="http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=24979"> Saudi Arabia detains 40 Christians</a>.)   									&nbsp;Saudi leaders demand hypocritically that their citizens enjoy full religious liberties around the world. Europe is complacent about this double-standard and the lack of religious liberty within many of the Muslim nations. This Western complacency contributes to the Muslims’ attitude that Muslims are the only ones who are humiliated and victimized. If they were vigorously challenged to treat others as they desired to be treated, they would be forced to stop humiliating and victimizing their minorities and learn to be tolerant. See the articles,

<p align="justify">Clearly there is nothing in the Qur’an or ahadith that specifically condemns pictures of the Prophet of Islam. The 
prohibition is against any picture of animate life.</p>

											2520. A well-known scholar of our times &lsquo;Allama Muhammad Munir (of Damascus) has clearly stated that the photos of the modern age fall under the category of pictures. He says: &ldquo;The words of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) that every maker of the photo would be tormented on the Day of Ressurection, include every artist: whether he makes a picture with the help of his hand (with pencil or with the help of colour paint) or with the help of camera&rdquo; (marginal notes on the book Ihham al-Ahham, Sharh, &lsquo;Umdat al-Ahham, Vol. II, p. 37.</P>

<p align="justify">At best, Shari&rsquo;a law condemns pictures depicting animate life.<a href="#reference5" name="reference 5" id="reference 5"><sup>5</sup></a> Even here most Muslims have no respect for Shari’a law and enjoy family photographs and TV programs as much as anyone else. Although it seems obvious that photographs and TV programming are prohibited, one Muslim scholar twists the words of Muhammad and claims that photographs and TV programming are not picture making!  “Photography is not picture making, but merely “the retention of an object’s shadow” (habs al-zill) 
and therefore permissible.” <sup>
<font face="Verdana">
<a href="#reference6" name="reference 6" id="reference 6">6</a></font></sup>&nbsp; Even the fundamentalist regime in Saudi Arabia provides TV programming showing pictures from around the world!  Apparently, it&rsquo;s optional to obey the Prophet of Islam even in Saudi Arabia!  Why aren&rsquo;t cartoons optional too? </p>
<h3>Mocking Muhammad</h3>
<p align="justify">The requirement to respect Muhammad is found in the Qur&rsquo;an and ahadith.  Apparently, this is the main justification for the cartoon outrage. The Qur&rsquo;an depicts Muhammad as the perfect pattern of conduct for the world. Furthermore Allah and the angels send blessings upon the Prophet of Islam. So to disparage Muhammad is to revile the object of 
the angels’ and Allah&rsquo;s blessings. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Allah and His angels send blessings on the Prophet: O ye that believe! Send ye blessings on him, and salute him with all respect. Ahzab 33:56
	<sup><font face="Verdana"> <a href="#reference7" name="reference 7" id="reference 7">7</a></font></sup><br />
    Ye have indeed in the Messenger of Allah a beautiful pattern (of conduct) for any one whose hope is in Allah and the Final Day, and who engages much in the Praise of Allah. Ahzab 33:21
	<sup><font face="Verdana"> <a href="#reference8" name="reference 8" id="reference 8">8</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">When someone disparaged Muhammad during his life time, what was the punishment? The Sunan of Abu Dawud gives an account of a woman who disparaged Muhammad. Her blind husband murdered her by stabbing her in the belly.  Muhammad sanctioned her murder, not allowing any punishment for murdering this unfortunate woman. This punishment is a 
precedent for Shari’a law.</p>
<p align="center">Chapter 1606 </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center">PUNISHMENT OF A MAN WHO ABUSES THE PROPHET    (MAY PEACE BE UPON HIM) 
	<sup><font face="Verdana"> <a href="#reference9" name="reference 9" id="reference 9">9</a></font></sup></p>
  <p align="justify">(4348) Ibn &lsquo;Abb&#257;s said: <strong>A blind man had a slave-mother who used to abuse the Prophet (may peace be upon him) and disparage him.</strong> He forbade her but she did not stop. He rebuked her but she did not give up her habit. On one night she began to slander the Prophet (may peace be upon him) and abuse him. <strong>So he took a dagger, placed it on her belly, pressed it, and killed her. A child who came between her legs was smeared with the blood that was there.</strong> When the morning came, the Prophet (may peace be upon him) was informed about it. He assembled the people and said: I adjure by Allah the man who has done this action and I adjure him by my right to him that he should get up. Jumping over the necks of the people and trembling the man stood up. He sat before the Prophet (may peace be upon him) and said: Apostle of Allah! I am her master; she used to abuse you and disparage you. I forbade her, but she did not stop, and I rebuked her, but she did not leave her habit. I have two sons like pearls from her, and she was my companion. Last night she began to abuse and disparage you. So I took a dagger, put it on her belly and pressed it till I killed her. <strong>Thereupon the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said, Oh, be witness, no retaliation is payable for her blood.</strong> (Bold emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
									<p align="justify">In the following case, Muhammad joked 
                                    about the murder of  &lsquo;Asma Bint Marwan, 
                                    the lady who had offended him. He said; two goats won&rsquo;t butt their heads over her. The murderer left the scene of the crime and went to the morning prayers where Muhammad whispered, &ldquo;Have you slain the daughter of Marwan?&rdquo;  Such were his holy thoughts during the time of prayer!</p>
									<blockquote>
  <p align="center">SARIYYAH OF &lsquo;UMAYR IBN &lsquo;ADI</p>
	<p align="justify">Then (occurred) the sariyyah of &lsquo;Umayr ibn &lsquo;Adi Ibn Kharashah al-Khatmi against &lsquo;Asma Bint Marwan, of Banu Umayyah Ibn Zayd, when five nights had remained from the month of Ramadan, in the beginning of the nineteenth month from the hijrah of the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him.  &lsquo;Asma was the wife of Yazid Ibn Zayd Ibn Hisn al-Khatmi.  She used to revile Islam, offend &#1578;&#1572;&#1584;&#1609; the Prophet and instigate the (people) against him.  She composed verses.  &lsquo;Umayr Ibn &lsquo;Adi came to her in the night and entered her house. <strong>Her children were sleeping around her.  There was one whom she was suckling.  He searched her with his hand because he was blind, and separated the child from her.  He thrust his sword in her chest till it pierced up to her back.  Then he offered the morning prayers with the Prophet</strong>, may Allah bless him, at al-Mahinah.  The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, said to him:  Have you slain the daughter of Marwan?  He said: Yes.  Is there something more for me to do?  He [Muhammad] said: <strong>No, Two goats will butt together about her</strong>.  This was the word that was first heard from the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him.  The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, called him &lsquo;Umayr, basir (the seeing).

</blockquote>
<p align="justify">In Shari’a law, these examples of mocking Muhammad are legal precedents to punish someone who has mocked him. </p>
	<p align="justify">According to the ancient prophets, <b>blaspheme applies to someone who makes an image of God
	</b>(Exodus 20:3-7 and Deuteronomy 5:7-11). However, 
	<b>Muhammad is not God, so their riotous and murderous behavior is itself blasphemous.</b></p>
<h3>Jesus &amp; Muhammad</h3>
<p align="justify">The comparison between Lord Jesus Christ and Muhammad 
contrasts starkly. People reviled Jesus as one who was born of fornication (John 8:41), a blasphemer (Matthew 26:65), possessed of a demon and raving mad (John 10:20), a glutton, and a winebibber (Matthew 11:19). He bore the reviling, because he came to die sacrificially for sinners. Muhammad came 
seeking political honor and prestige. What a contrast to the Lord Jesus Christ, who, when he was mocked, smitten, and derided, said, Father forgive them! See the articles, <a href="http://www.muhammadanism.org/Islam/islam_tolerance_cross.htm">Islam, Tolerance, and the Cross</a>, <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/TasteAndSee/ByDate/2006/1775_Being_Mocked_The_Essence_of_Christs_Work_Not_Muhammads/">

<a href="http://www.answering-islam.org/Authors/Arlandson/insult_responses.htm">
Insulting and threatening: Jesus and Muhammad</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">And the men that held Jesus <strong>mocked</strong> him, and <strong>smote</strong> him.<br />
    And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?<br>
	And many other things <strong>blasphemously spake they against him</strong>. Luke 22:63-65<br />
    Then said Jesus, <strong>Father, forgive them</strong>; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.<br />
    And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them <strong>derided him</strong>, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.<br />
    And the soldiers also <strong>mocked him</strong>, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, Luke 23:34-36 (KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Such is the amazing moral distance between the 
spear-pierced Savior of the Cross and the 
bloody Prophet of the Sword.  
As the influence of Christianity wanes in Europe, the influence of Islam 
ascends. Mosques appear and churches are converted into museums and tourist attractions. </p>
<h3>Hollywood Is Scared</h3>
<p align="justify">Hollywood loves to push the boundaries of social sensibilities. However, when it comes to the icons of Islam, Hollywood is fearful to produce a 
historically accurate movie of Muhammad’s life. Muhammad fought battles, beheaded hundreds of people, married many women — including a nine-year old girl when he was a 54 year old man, raided merchant caravans, flew during the night on a winged animal whose size was between a donkey and a horse to the temple mount in Jerusalem. If Jesus Christ had beheaded people, married many women or had robbed caravans, and flew around on a winged-donkey, Hollywood would have produced numerous films lampooning his life. However, Hollywood film directors and actors are afraid they would 
have their throats slit, if they produced a realistic movie of Muhammad’s life.</p>
<h3>Will the West die peacefully?</h3>
<p align="justify">European’s Western civilization has left its Christian 
heritage and is dying and being replaced by Islam. So, will this transition be 
peaceful or filled with conflict? Europeans have lost the will to live and 
flourish as a moral and religious people. For Islam to become the dominate 
religion of Europe, Muslims have little more to do other than to continue to 
value their families and have children. Already, many of Europe’s leaders submit to Islam, blaming the Europeans themselves for the Muslim demonstrations 
and riots. Mentally, it is as if they have already accepted the status of <em>dhimmitude</em>.</p>
<p align="justify">A civilization dies when it diminishes the value of children. Many nations in the Western world have legalized abortion, developed birth control pills, and affirmed the homosexual lifestyle. Societies succumb when they demean married life, postpone marriage for as long as possible, engage in sexually promiscuous behavior, tolerate the drug culture, and value self-gratifying hedonism more than moral virtue. 
Biologically, Europe is dying!&nbsp;<sup><font face="Verdana"><a href="#reference11" name="reference 11" id="reference 11">11</a></font></sup>  Between North America (40+ million in the USA) and Europe, more than 100 million babies have been aborted. The numbers will increased due to the popularity of the French abortifacient pill Mifepristone (RU486). One article states 
there are <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/node/3108">More Abortions Than Births in Russia</a>. Abortive societies loathe their own existence, valuing the death of their offspring more than life and the future. So, it is rather pointless for Muslims to engage in an unnecessary conflict, while the West is busy destroying itself.</p>
<p align="justify">Westerners are proud of their democracy, liberalism, scientific and technical advancements. 
In their pride, they assume that Muslim immigrants will adopt their Western values. However, many Muslims are appalled by Western moral standards, and they feel they should avoid the popular culture to preserve their families. Because they view the West as morally decadent, they return to Islam for spiritual, moral, social, and political guidance. 
<i>Islam is their Complete Way of Life</i>. Such was the case with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid_Qutb">Sayid Qutb</a>, 
a key intellectual figure associated with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, who 
became radicalized after visiting the West. On the other hand, Western TV 
programs show frenzied Muslim mobs rampaging through the streets and burning down 
buildings. So, the tension between Islam and the West 
continues to grow. </p>
