 Cartoons, Muhammad & Europe — Muhammadanism.org

  Muhammadanism Over a billion people in the world follow the teaching of the Prophet Muhammad. His followers accept the validity of the prophethood of Muhammad and sincerely believe that his teachings are a divine message from Allah (God) by the instrumentality of the angel Gabriel. They believe that the message is embodied in the Holy Qur'an, and this Qur'an is the living word of Allah for all of humanity.            Home    Revelation    Muhammad    Islam    Government    Trinity    Gospel    Scripture    Urdu    Audio    Resources     Arabic      Farsi     Русский    German    Chinese      News    Terrorism      الحيـاة الأفضـل      Qur'an      الطريق إلى الجنة      Jesus    Books    Sacrifice         Hadith    Search       عربى      فارسى     Türkçe    Español    Maps           Muhammad The Life of Muhammad  بحثاً عن مُحَمَّدٍ التَّاريِخيّ  Islam & Beheading Muhammadanism: The Term  محمَّد في الكتاب المقدّس  Seal Of Prophethood Muhammad, Islam, & Terrorism  مُحَمَّدُ والوَثَنِيّة Cartoons, Muhammad & Europe Muhammad or Jesus Does the Qur'an refer to Muhammad's sins? Marriage to Daughter-in-law Muhammad & Occult Killing  Jews Beheaded  Ripped Apart           Cartoons, Muhammad & Europe Muslims finally speak out Westerners have complained that Muslims around the world have been largely silent about the Islamic terrorism, such as the events of 9/11, the bombings in Spain, London, Bali, etc… When the beheadings of Westerners were broadcast on Arab TV channels, there wasn’t much of a response. Now, they are demonstrating in the streets, burning down embassies, threatening murders, and desecrating national flags.  In Their Own Words shows photographs of them expressing their threats and hatred.  What has happened that is so despicable, so offensive, so as to cause Muslims worldwide to speak out so angrily? Why have Western leaders continued to repeat the mantra, Islam is a religion of peace? Do they suppose it will soothe our anxiety as we see screaming masses threatening to harm us? Why have Western TV stations exercised self-censorship and have not shown us the basis of this headline news story? The answer is that Muhammad is depicted in some cartoons! Most Western news organizations have deferred to the sensitivities of Muslims, saying they  respect Islam, when, in reality, they  fear  it. Cartoon Background It is surprising that Muslims were shocked over the cartoons that played upon the relationship between Muhammad and terrorism. After all, before going on their missions of terror, Muslim suicide bombers read the Qur’an and pray. These Muslims view their missions as religious acts to attain virginal paradise and to terrorize those whom they believe are the enemies of Islam. Naturally, non-Muslims make the religious connection between Muhammad and terrorism, because this is exactly the connection that Muslims themselves make. Not surprisingly, Europeans have depicted this connection in their cartoons. "I am with you: give firmness to the Believers: I will instil  terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them." … Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike  terror into (the hearts of) the enemies, .. Sura Al-Anfal 8:12, 60 (Yusuf Ali’s translation)    1     European Muslims have political clout far beyond their numbers, because they can bring the Muslims from around the world to their cause. Many don’t know that the Danish Muslims sent a delegation to the Muslim leaders of the Middle East to show them a 43-page dossier on the published cartoons. (See  Danish Muslims "Internationalize" Anti-Prophet Cartoons and  How rage built: The cartoon trail to Mecca . An English translation of the dossier is available on the  Counterterrorism Blog .)  In addition to the cartoons that appeared in the  Jyllands-Posten, the Danish Imams added fabricated cartoons to their dossier to incite their Middle Eastern friends. Kaare Quist reported in  Spiegel Online that “the dossier included three obscene caricatures — one showed Muhammad as a pedophile, another one as a pig and the last one depicted a praying Muslim being raped by a dog.” These fabricated cartoons are under investigation. (See  Another Possible Hoax of a Cartoon; Call For Graphology Expertise ,  Media look for answers on extra cartoons , and  Fabricated cartoons worsened Danish controversy .) Did the Imams Insult the Prophet Muhammad? The  Muhammad Pig Face cartoon outraged multitudes of Muslims. However, the  Muhammad Pig Face illustration was really an alteration of a photograph of Jacques Barrot performing in the French Pig-Squealing Championships in Trie-sur-Baise's annual festival. MSNBC carried the story August 5, 2005 in an article entitled,  Duo hogs top prize in pig-squealing contest . The article,  Danish Imams Busted! , compares the  Muhammad Pig Face cartoon to the  Pig-Squealing Contest photograph. The  Cartoon Hoax article discusses the Imam’s deception further. If the Brussels Journal’s premise is correct, the Danish Imams used deceitfulness to incite hatred among their Middle Eastern co-religionists.  You can make up your own mind if the  Muhammad Pig Face cartoon is an alteration of the  Pig-Squealing Contest photograph by comparing the two images below.       Muhammad Cartoon Contest Photo    The Brussels Journal wonders whether Muslims will demand the execution of the Danish Imams because they insulted Muhammad with a pig's face? While news reports focus on the violent riots, little attention is given to the role of the Imams in fomenting Western hatred. Imams use  humiliation and  victimization as an excuse to blame the West — rather than Islam itself — for their cultural, economic, and scientific backwardness. Moderate Muslim journalists in Jordan and Yemen have been arrested and are sitting in jail even though they apologized for printing the cartoons.   2    Muslim’s Hypocritical Standard Muslims have always enjoyed demeaning and hateful cartoons as long as the ridicule was on someone else. Anti-Jewish cartoons are a source of endless entertainment for the Muslim masses. Cartoons on Muslim TV programs ridiculed Jews as apes and pigs. The  Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a fraudulent document that is depicted as authentic in Saudi Arabia textbooks. Teaching Muslim children the truth is not as important as indoctrinating hatred in Saudi Arabia. If respect is important to Muslims, then they should show respect to non-Muslims and their religions. Respect is not a one-way street.  When churches and synagogues can be built and attended freely in Saudi Arabia, then we will know that Islam is a tolerant and respectful religion.  They might start by allowing the scriptures of the holy prophets to be publicly sold there. These Muslim cartoons are no accident because the Qur’an itself demeans Jews, Christians, and pagans. It calls them apes (2:65), swine (5:60), asses (74:50), dogs (7:176), and cattle (7:179). Their holy book uses this derogatory and demeaning language. So, it is not surprising that during Hajj Muslims find it spiritually acceptable to curse America. See Hajj video  Iranian Pilgrims in Mecca Shout "Death to America, the Great Satan" in an Anti-American Rally .  Saudi Arabia spends millions of dollars to spread Islam around the world. At the same time, they won’t allow a single church, synagogue, or temple to be built anywhere within its borders. Some Western universities welcome the advance of Islam because they receive millions of Saudi dollars. (See article  Saudi Prince Gives Millions To Harvard and Georgetown .)  Yet, Saudis jail non-Muslims who have private prayer meetings in their own home. (See article  Saudi Arabia detains 40 Christians .)  Saudi leaders demand hypocritically that their citizens enjoy full religious liberties around the world. Europe is complacent about this double-standard and the lack of religious liberty within many of the Muslim nations. This Western complacency contributes to the Muslims’ attitude that Muslims are the only ones who are humiliated and victimized. If they were vigorously challenged to treat others as they desired to be treated, they would be forced to stop humiliating and victimizing their minorities and learn to be tolerant. See the articles,  Is Islam Above Criticism? and  Evangelical missionaries in Morocco back in the limelight . Another article,  16 die in cartoon protests in Nigeria , is a typical case where Muslims use an event as an excuse to kill Christians and burn down churches. See also,  Iraqi Churches Bombed: Link With Danish Cartoons? ,  Pictures in Islam Portrait of Mohammed by a Persian Artist     12        Clearly there is nothing in the Qur’an or ahadith that specifically condemns pictures of the Prophet of Islam. The prohibition is against any picture of animate life. "Verity, the most grievously tormented people amongest the denizens of Hell on the Day of Resurrection would be the painters of pictures.”2520   3  NOTE: 2520. A well-known scholar of our times ‘Allama Muhammad Munir (of Damascus) has clearly stated that the photos of the modern age fall under the category of pictures. He says: “The words of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) that every maker of the photo would be tormented on the Day of Ressurection, include every artist: whether he makes a picture with the help of his hand (with pencil or with the help of colour paint) or with the help of camera” (marginal notes on the book Ihham al-Ahham, Sharh, ‘Umdat al-Ahham, Vol. II, p. 37.   Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). I heard him say: All the painters who make pictures would be in the fire of Hell. The soul will be breathed in every picture prepared by him and it shall punish him in the Hell…   4   At best, Shari’a law condemns pictures depicting animate life.  5  Even here most Muslims have no respect for Shari’a law and enjoy family photographs and TV programs as much as anyone else. Although it seems obvious that photographs and TV programming are prohibited, one Muslim scholar twists the words of Muhammad and claims that photographs and TV programming are not picture making! “Photography is not picture making, but merely “the retention of an object’s shadow” (habs al-zill) and therefore permissible.”    6     Even the fundamentalist regime in Saudi Arabia provides TV programming showing pictures from around the world! Apparently, it’s optional to obey the Prophet of Islam even in Saudi Arabia! Why aren’t cartoons optional too?  Mocking Muhammad The requirement to respect Muhammad is found in the Qur’an and ahadith. Apparently, this is the main justification for the cartoon outrage. The Qur’an depicts Muhammad as the perfect pattern of conduct for the world. Furthermore Allah and the angels send blessings upon the Prophet of Islam. So to disparage Muhammad is to revile the object of the angels’ and Allah’s blessings.  Allah and His angels send blessings on the Prophet: O ye that believe! Send ye blessings on him, and salute him with all respect. Ahzab 33:56    7   Ye have indeed in the Messenger of Allah a beautiful pattern (of conduct) for any one whose hope is in Allah and the Final Day, and who engages much in the Praise of Allah. Ahzab 33:21    8     When someone disparaged Muhammad during his life time, what was the punishment? The Sunan of Abu Dawud gives an account of a woman who disparaged Muhammad. Her blind husband murdered her by stabbing her in the belly. Muhammad sanctioned her murder, not allowing any punishment for murdering this unfortunate woman. This punishment is a precedent for Shari’a law. Chapter 1606  PUNISHMENT OF A MAN WHO ABUSES THE PROPHET (MAY PEACE BE UPON HIM)    9    (4348) Ibn ‘Abbās said:  A blind man had a slave-mother who used to abuse the Prophet (may peace be upon him) and disparage him. He forbade her but she did not stop. He rebuked her but she did not give up her habit. On one night she began to slander the Prophet (may peace be upon him) and abuse him.  So he took a dagger, placed it on her belly, pressed it, and killed her. A child who came between her legs was smeared with the blood that was there. When the morning came, the Prophet (may peace be upon him) was informed about it. He assembled the people and said: I adjure by Allah the man who has done this action and I adjure him by my right to him that he should get up. Jumping over the necks of the people and trembling the man stood up. He sat before the Prophet (may peace be upon him) and said: Apostle of Allah! I am her master; she used to abuse you and disparage you. I forbade her, but she did not stop, and I rebuked her, but she did not leave her habit. I have two sons like pearls from her, and she was my companion. Last night she began to abuse and disparage you. So I took a dagger, put it on her belly and pressed it till I killed her.  Thereupon the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said, Oh, be witness, no retaliation is payable for her blood. (Bold emphasis added)  In the following case, Muhammad joked about the murder of ‘Asma Bint Marwan, the lady who had offended him. He said; two goats won’t butt their heads over her. The murderer left the scene of the crime and went to the morning prayers where Muhammad whispered, “Have you slain the daughter of Marwan?” Such were his holy thoughts during the time of prayer! SARIYYAH OF ‘UMAYR IBN ‘ADI Then (occurred) the sariyyah of ‘Umayr ibn ‘Adi Ibn Kharashah al-Khatmi against ‘Asma Bint Marwan, of Banu Umayyah Ibn Zayd, when five nights had remained from the month of Ramadan, in the beginning of the nineteenth month from the hijrah of the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him. ‘Asma was the wife of Yazid Ibn Zayd Ibn Hisn al-Khatmi. She used to revile Islam, offend تؤذى the Prophet and instigate the (people) against him. She composed verses. ‘Umayr Ibn ‘Adi came to her in the night and entered her house.  Her children were sleeping around her. There was one whom she was suckling. He searched her with his hand because he was blind, and separated the child from her. He thrust his sword in her chest till it pierced up to her back. Then he offered the morning prayers with the Prophet , may Allah bless him, at al-Mahinah. The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, said to him: Have you slain the daughter of Marwan? He said: Yes. Is there something more for me to do? He [Muhammad] said:  No, Two goats will butt together about her . This was the word that was first heard from the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him. The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, called him ‘Umayr, basir (the seeing).    10   (Bold emphasis added)   In Shari’a law, these examples of mocking Muhammad are legal precedents to punish someone who has mocked him.  According to the ancient prophets,  blaspheme applies to someone who makes an image of God  (Exodus 20:3-7 and Deuteronomy 5:7-11). However,  Muhammad is not God, so their riotous and murderous behavior is itself blasphemous.  Jesus & Muhammad The comparison between Lord Jesus Christ and Muhammad contrasts starkly. People reviled Jesus as one who was born of fornication (John 8:41), a blasphemer (Matthew 26:65), possessed of a demon and raving mad (John 10:20), a glutton, and a winebibber (Matthew 11:19). He bore the reviling, because he came to die sacrificially for sinners. Muhammad came seeking political honor and prestige. What a contrast to the Lord Jesus Christ, who, when he was mocked, smitten, and derided, said, Father forgive them! See the articles,  Islam, Tolerance, and the Cross ,  Being Mocked: The Essence of Christ’s Work, Not Muhammad’s , and  Insulting and threatening: Jesus and Muhammad . And the men that held Jesus  mocked him, and  smote him. And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? And many other things  blasphemously spake they against him . Luke 22:63-65 Then said Jesus,  Father, forgive them ; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them  derided him , saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God. And the soldiers also  mocked him , coming to him, and offering him vinegar, Luke 23:34-36 (KJV)  Such is the amazing moral distance between the spear-pierced Savior of the Cross and the bloody Prophet of the Sword. As the influence of Christianity wanes in Europe, the influence of Islam ascends. Mosques appear and churches are converted into museums and tourist attractions.  Hollywood Is Scared Hollywood loves to push the boundaries of social sensibilities. However, when it comes to the icons of Islam, Hollywood is fearful to produce a historically accurate movie of Muhammad’s life. Muhammad fought battles, beheaded hundreds of people, married many women — including a nine-year old girl when he was a 54 year old man, raided merchant caravans, flew during the night on a winged animal whose size was between a donkey and a horse to the temple mount in Jerusalem. If Jesus Christ had beheaded people, married many women or had robbed caravans, and flew around on a winged-donkey, Hollywood would have produced numerous films lampooning his life. However, Hollywood film directors and actors are afraid they would have their throats slit, if they produced a realistic movie of Muhammad’s life. Will the West die peacefully? European’s Western civilization has left its Christian heritage and is dying and being replaced by Islam. So, will this transition be peaceful or filled with conflict? Europeans have lost the will to live and flourish as a moral and religious people. For Islam to become the dominate religion of Europe, Muslims have little more to do other than to continue to value their families and have children. Already, many of Europe’s leaders submit to Islam, blaming the Europeans themselves for the Muslim demonstrations and riots. Mentally, it is as if they have already accepted the status of  dhimmitude . A civilization dies when it diminishes the value of children. Many nations in the Western world have legalized abortion, developed birth control pills, and affirmed the homosexual lifestyle. Societies succumb when they demean married life, postpone marriage for as long as possible, engage in sexually promiscuous behavior, tolerate the drug culture, and value self-gratifying hedonism more than moral virtue. Biologically, Europe is dying!    11   Between North America (40+ million in the USA) and Europe, more than 100 million babies have been aborted. The numbers will increased due to the popularity of the French abortifacient pill Mifepristone (RU486). One article states there are  More Abortions Than Births in Russia . Abortive societies loathe their own existence, valuing the death of their offspring more than life and the future. So, it is rather pointless for Muslims to engage in an unnecessary conflict, while the West is busy destroying itself. Westerners are proud of their democracy, liberalism, scientific and technical advancements. In their pride, they assume that Muslim immigrants will adopt their Western values. However, many Muslims are appalled by Western moral standards, and they feel they should avoid the popular culture to preserve their families. Because they view the West as morally decadent, they return to Islam for spiritual, moral, social, and political guidance.  Islam is their Complete Way of Life . Such was the case with  Sayid Qutb , a key intellectual figure associated with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, who became radicalized after visiting the West. On the other hand, Western TV programs show frenzied Muslim mobs rampaging through the streets and burning down buildings. So, the tension between Islam and the West continues to grow.
