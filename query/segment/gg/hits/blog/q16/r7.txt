 The cartoons Islam has killed for

  return to  Bible Probe    Visit the  Message Board      Translations:  Übersetzung |  Traducción |   |  Traduction     E-mail This Page                   Islam has killed for    Freedom of Speech vs militant Islam     Same ole Militant Islamic Nit Wits      These cartoons are a good idea, because Muslims have been hoodwinked so long, that finally having to face the truth is the first step in their freedom from these Gestapo-like mullahs and imams who have been brain-washing Muslims for far too long (1374 yrs)...     Maybe now Muslims will get the idea, that not only was Muhammad not a prophet, but he wasn't even a good human being. Muhammad raped, plundered and murdered, and he married a 6 yr old girl when he was in his 50's. He had everyone killed who disagreed with him. Muslims remain in denial about this guy....  He admitted twice in the Qur'an that he could do no miracles to show any divinity.  And Muhammad made no real prophecy.  In all the Qur'an Muhammad made only one (1) vague guess about the Romans winning some future battle; no time or place given.  That's it! One guess.  The real sad part is that Muslims are willing to, and gullible enough to bet their salvation on this guy.        What this Cartoon Row comes down to...   Islam does not mean "Peace".   It means "Submission"!     Nobody is allowed to disagree with Islam... All MUST submit!      T     he Muslim Qur'an is unique among all the sacred writings in the entire world -- because it alone counsels its followers to make war on unbelievers. Both Muslim holy books (Qur'an/Koran and Hadith) contain commands for Muslims to subjugate the world, militarily.  Muhammad commanded Muslims to spread Islam through Offensive Jihad; or conquest of non-Muslim lands.  Muslims are also commanded to take back any land that was formerly Muslim, such as Israel.     Radical Muslims believe that they are Mujahideen, or "holy warriors of Allah".  Their goal, like Islam's goal is to establish the entire world as a pure Islamic state (a Khalifah), which conforms to Islamic laws.     Standing in Islam's way for this world subjugation is the West, especially America.  This is why you often hear Muslims calling America the "Great Satan".   Islam simply does not understand that it is Satan who wants to subjugate the world.  He is doing this in the name of Islam.  Satan is a slave master who hoodwinked Muhammad and Islam into thinking that he is God, and that he demands subjugation by the sword if necessary.  To do this, Satan needs to squelch the spirit of freedom everywhere.  This includes freedom of speech - and, especially belief in the true Prince of Peace, and the only Son of God.       Muslims deny Jesus, the true Prince of Peace!     A few things reliable Scripture says about Jesus follow :    And Thomas answered and said unto him [Jesus],  My Lord and my God. John 20:28  I and my Father are one. John 10:30  God was manifest in the flesh... 1 Timothy 3:16  I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. John 8:24  Muslims have to get over the lie that God cannot begot. He surely did. He did it in "the book".  Look to Genesis where God says; Genesis 1:26 (4000 Before Christ / 4570 yrs before Muhammad): "And God said,    Let us   make man in our image...."   Proverbs 30:4 (700 Before Christ / 1270 yrs before Muhammad): "Who hath ascended up into heaven or descended? Who hath gathered the wind in His fists? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath established all the ends of the Earth? What is His name, and   what is   His son's  name  , if thou canst tell?" Psalm 2:11-12 (about 1000 B.C.)    Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.  Kiss the Son , lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.  "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."  John 3:16    Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name   Immanuel  .  Isaiah 7:14  (written: 712 BC (Before Christ)  Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call His name   Emmanuel  , which being interpreted is,  God with us . Matthew 1:23       See the over 360 Messianic Prophecies of Jesus  here                   Here is an example of the typical intolerant, Muslim blood thirsty over reaction to these European Cartoons below:  Hamas leader Mahmoud Zahar told the Italian daily il Giornale on February 4, 2006 that the cartoons were an offense that should be punished by death.  " We should have killed all those who offend the Prophet and instead here we are, protesting peacefully ," Zahar said.           Actually, the European Cartoons (some shown below), are not nearly as honest as this first (American) Cartoon below:          Newspapers across Europe have reprinted caricatures of Muhammad to show support for a Danish paper whose cartoons have sparked Muslim outrage.     Examples of cartoons Muslims are so upset about follow:                    Christians & Jewish martyrs say; "I will die for what I believe" .    A Muslim martyr says; "you will die for what I believe" ....                The riots throughout the Middle East and the burnings in early February 2006, of Danish government offices in Damascus and Beirut in protest of newspaper cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad bear the fingerprints of "Iranian and Syrian plotting," Lebanese leader Walid Jumblatt charged.  He warned Syria and Iran might use the cartoon riots as a pretense to attack American and European troops in Iraq.  Read more at  WND              Seven publications in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain all carried some of the drawings.   Their publication in Denmark led Arab nations to protest. Islamic tradition bans depictions of the Prophet.  The owner of one of the papers to reprint - France Soir - has now sacked its managing editor over the matter.      France Soir     The cartoons have sparked diplomatic sanctions and death threats in some Arab nations, while media watchdogs have defended publication of the images in the name of press freedom.  Reporters Without Borders said the reaction in the Arab world "betrays a lack of understanding" of press freedom as "an essential accomplishment of democracy."  'Spiting Muslims'  France Soir and Germany's Die Welt were among the leading papers to reprint the cartoons, which first appeared in Denmark last September.  The caricatures include drawings of Muhammad wearing a headdress shaped like a bomb, while another shows him saying that paradise was running short of virgins for suicide bombers.  France Soir originally said it had published the images in full to show "religious dogma" had no place in a secular society.

Reports have shown brief glimpses of the pictures in some of the European newspapers which have published them, but no close-ups.   One English reader wrote: "You cannot report a news subject relating to a visual matter without showing that matter."    'Spineless'   Other viewers said the BBC was being spineless, and Peter Arnold commented: "It appears that you are scared of the reaction from Muslims, while you were not concerned about offending Christians when you screened Jerry Springer - The Opera. This is a case of double standards."            Evidence suggests the riots to be useful to "al-Qaida"      The instigators       EVIDENCE THAT ISLAMIC MULLAHS AND IMAMS FANNED THE FLAMES OVER THESE CARTOONS:   The above cartoons appeared in Egyptian Newspapers way back on October 17, 2005.  Below is from page 17 of Egypt's al-Fagr newspaper on that date.  Muslims used these to fan riots that began in February 2006.    A Danish imam (Imam Ahmad Abu Laban) distributed the below picture via fax to fan the flames in Europe.  The picture below, however, had nothing to do with Islam.  The imam lied that it was an example of an anti-Islamic picture..     The picture he distributed below was a faxed copy of Associated Press's August 15, 2005 photo of Jacques Barrot competing at the annual French Pig-Squealing Championships in Trie-sur-Baise.  Note the similarities between the real picture and the faxed picture below?  First picture shows the faxed photo.               Ahmed Abu Laban       The Danish imam who helped instigate a protest worldwide also supports al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.   According to the Israeli daily Maariv, Imam Ahmed Abu Laban, who is the leader of the Islamic Society of Denmark, said in his Friday sermon just days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon that he shed no tears for the victims.        The beginning of the "flame fanning"   .  Muslim cleric Ahmed Abu Laban said the below on November 2005;   COPENHAGEN, November 18, 2005 (IslamOnline.net) – The Muslim minority in Denmark will send delegations to a number of Muslim countries to meet with senior officials and prominent scholars on the provocative caricatures of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) .  Abu Laban also said; that Al-Azhar, the highest seat of learning in the Sunni world, has been notified of the forthcoming visit.  "The delegation will also visit Saudi Arabia and Qatar to meet with renowned Muslim scholar Sheikh Yussef Al-Qaradawi," said Abu Laban, the imam of the Scandinavian Waqfs mosque.    The Danish Muslim delegation    Abu Laban spoke of above    showed much more than the 12 cartoons published by Jyllands Posten around the Muslim world, however  . In the booklet it presented during its tour of the Middle East, the delegation   included other cartoons of Muhammad that were highly offensive, including the one above of    Jacques Barrot.  This delegation claimed it was a cartoon of Muhammad   with      a pig face  .                  Below are 3 fake Cartoons Abu Laban and others who toured the Middle East passed around:      During a February 11th Muslim "rally" in in Trafalgar Square, London, Dr Azam Tamimi, a senior figure in the Muslim Association of Britain, which staged the event incited those 5000 protesters present, when he said: "The publication of these cartoons will cause the world to tremble. Fire will be throughout the world if they don't stop."     Arab Cartoons about Jews  To show that Muslims insist the world respect their sensitivities, yet Muslims always feel free to disrespect others, let's look at just a few recent insulting cartoons from Arab countries:         Al-Watan , January 6, 2006 (Qatar)            Al-Bayan, December 22, 2005 (United Arab Emirates)            Tishrin, Apirl 21, 2002 (Syria)            Al-Yawm , December 1, 2005 (Saudi Arabia)            Ar-Rai , November 5, 2005 (Jordan)             Al-Wifaq , February 6, 2006 (Iran)       Translation: The Jewish/Israeli devil is saying: "I don't admit the limits of freedom of speech except the Holocaust."        Al-Hayat al-Jadida  22 March 2000   Showing a large Pope talking to a small Jew with the skin, feet, and tail of an animal, and a big hooked nose, wearing a  kippa . The Pope exclaimed 'Peace on Earth' while the Satanic-looking Jew calls out 'Colonies on Earth.'"     Palestinian child urinates on Lady Liberty   In a Hamas publication      The cartoon in the Hamas publication Al-Risala on May 25, 2006 is typical of the visual and verbal attacks on U.S. symbols often seen in Palestinian Authority publications.         Muslims insist that nobody can depict Islam in a negative way.  Islam has always gone as far as intimidation and murder to accomplish this.   Muslims will often scream "bloody murder" that slandering any religion (but they really only mean especially Islam) should be punishable regardless of freedom of speech.  Yet Muslims see no problem whatsoever with selling negative books and cartoons about Christians or Jews or anything making America or Israel look bad.    All over the Muslim world,   kiosks openly stock the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a notorious anti-Semitic text that purports to be an account of Jewish plans to rule the world, but was actually written by Tsarist secret police in 1905.  They also sell Hitler's autobiography, Mein Kampf.            The Truth about Muhammad (aka: Mohammed) is!   Muhammad did no miracles. He did not heal the sick, raise the dead, cast out demons, or rule the wind and the waves. He had no more power than any normal man.  Muhammad admitted twice himself in the Qur'an (Koran) that he could do no miracles to show any divinity.  For Muslims to later make up miracle stories about Muhammad in their Hadiths is merely an attempt by Islam to remove Muhammad from his actual place in history; what we know today as a terrorist leader, who plundered for personal gain.  Muhammad was also an intolerant person who had everyone killed who disagreed with him.  Islamic and Arab historians have adequately reported Muhammad's  life in this regard (read: "  Muhammad, Terrorist or Prophet?  " ).  Muhammad's less than stellar morality is something the Islamic world remains in denial about.     The famous Iranian scholar, Ali Dashti comments about Mohammed:   Moslems, as well as others, have disregarded the historical facts. They have continually striven to turn this man [Mohammed] into an imaginary superhuman being, a sort of God in human clothes, and have generally ignored the ample evidence of his humanity. They have been ready… to present these fantasies as miracles.    Reference: Ali Dashti, "Twenty Three Years: A Study of the Prophetic Career of Mohammad",      Writers issue cartoon row warning            1 March 2006  Salman Rushdie is among a dozen writers to have put their names to a statement in a French weekly paper warning against Islamic "totalitarianism".  The writers say the violence sparked by the publication of cartoons satirising the Prophet Muhammad shows the need to fight for secular values and freedom.   The statement is published in Charlie Hebdo, one of several European papers to reprint the caricatures.   The images, first published in Denmark, have angered Muslims across the world.    One showed the Prophet Muhammad, whose depiction is banned in Islam, as a terrorist bomber.   Many newspapers defended their decision to reprint the cartoons on the grounds of freedom of expression.    'Global threat'   Almost all of those who have signed the statement have experienced difficulties with Islamic militancy first-hand, says the BBC's Caroline Wyatt in Paris.   They include Dutch MP and filmmaker Ayaan Hirsi Ali and exiled Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen.   "After having overcome fascism, Nazism, and Stalinism, the world now faces a new global threat: Islamism," the manifesto says.   "We, writers, journalists, intellectuals, call for resistance to religious totalitarianism and for the promotion of freedom, equal opportunity and secular values for all."   The clashes over the cartoons "revealed the necessity of the struggle for these universal values," the statement continues.   "It is not a clash of civilizations nor an antagonism of West and East that we are witnessing, but a global struggle that confronts democrats and theocrats."   The writers said they refused to accept that Muslim men and women "should be deprived of their rights to equality, liberty or secularity in the name of respect for culture or tradition".   They also said they would not give up their critical spirit out of fear of being accused of Islamophobia.   "Islamism is a reactionary ideology which kills equality, freedom and secularism wherever it is present," the writers added, saying it is nurtured by fears and frustrations.       Feb 2008   Contradiction in Arab cartoon views              Blatantly anti-Semitic literature is on sale in Cairo, just like many other Arab capitals. The BBC News website's Martin Patience reports on the apparent inconsistency in the Egyptian reaction to the Danish cartoons caricaturing the Prophet Muhammad.  Two hundred metres from the Arab League's headquarters in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, there are two newspaper kiosks on the pavement.    Cairo bookstalls and shops sell anti-Semitic texts          They sell all sorts of Egyptian papers and magazines - including Hijab, a fashion monthly for religious Muslim women showing a cover-girl wearing the latest style of headscarf.  Passing customers can also buy books - trashy romance novels, computer guidebooks, and children's story books.   But on closer inspection, both kiosks openly stock the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a notorious anti-Semitic text that purports to be an account of Jewish plans to rule the world, but was actually written by Tsarist secret police in 1905.   They also sell Hitler's autobiography, Mein Kampf.    West accused   With protests continuing throughout the world over cartoons satirising the Prophet Mohammed, Arab League Secretary General Amr Mousa weighed into the crisis recently, accusing the West of operating "double standards" when it came to freedom of expression.         When Islam is insulted, certain powers... raise the issue of freedom of expression. Freedom of expression should be one yardstick, not two or three      Amr Mousa        "What about freedom of expression when anti-Semitism is involved?" asked Mr Mousa.   "Then it is not freedom of expression. Then it is a crime.   "But when Islam is insulted, certain powers... raise the issue of freedom of expression. Freedom of expression should be one yardstick, not two or three," he said.        Read this entire article:  BBC                         READ, "Muhammad, Terrorist or Prophet?" here:  http://www.bibleprobe.com/mohammed.htm         READ, what ex-Muslims say about Islam here:  http://bibleprobe.com/islamapostates.htm        "Mohammed" found in Bible Codes      Islam claims to be a religion of "the book" which would have one believe it is a continuance of that book God revealed to his Jewish Prophets and Christian Apostles.     If it were, it would not deny what is in that "book" , especially after confirming the authority of the Jewish Torah and Christian Gospels .  If it were true, it would know the   name of the true God is  not Allah  , but    Yahweh   . ...              God is very "touchy" about His holy name.  He is not happy about Muslims misdirecting their sweet prayers to a pagan deity (Allah) and rejecting His only begotten Son's suffering, death, resurrection, and atonement.  He also is not happy with Mohammed making up Words (Qur'an) that He (God) did not say; thus leading billions of people astray - and misdirecting their sweet prayers to a non-existing deity.     Below have been found in the Bible Codes:        Red Diagonal:  "Mohammed"  Words crossing diagonal above: "Blaspheming"   Red crossing Diagonal below Blaspheming (left to right): "Demon"     Blue diagonal  right corner: "Satan"     Green across:  "The Unknown God" (as in Muslims pray to a God not there)   The "O" in "Mohammed" is the "O" in "God" in "The Unknown God". This is saying that Allah of Islam is not the God of the Bible, who is the true God, but rather Muslims are worshipping a nonexistent deity.      AND  below: " MOHAMMED " crosses "PROFANE MY HOLY NAME"           Recommended Reading (Book)     The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades)       Click picture to see at Amazon      This book should be required reading for all High School and College students. It is unfortunate that not many more scholars are willing to confront this topic with honestly and integrity. That's because there is academic bias on campus. Muslim students will protest violently and try to get teachers fired. Liberal professors commit the crime of denial by ignoring how much violence and destruction Islam has caused around the world. Islam has been successful in completely wiping out many middle eastern cultures and languages and replaced them with the pagan religion of Islam that requires its made up, nonsense-filled, holy book (Koran/Qur'an) only be read in a language most don't even understand --the language of Arabic.  Muslims destroyed Jewish synagogues, Christian churches & Hindu Temples all over the world, in their zeal to convert the entire world to Islam.  In retrospect, the Crusades were a good thing. They probably allowed the western world a thousand years of freedom from the diabolical Islamic religion. They stopped the expansion of the Islamic empire. This allowed Christianity to prosper in Europe which preserved the gospel for the rest of the world to receive. Christians should never apologize for the the Crusades, because these were a reaction to the Muslim crusades against the entire world. In the 7th century the Muslims took control of Jerusalem, and in the 11th century they began to hassle, kill, molest Christian pilgrims in the Jerusalem area. The Crusades were also in response to the cries of help from the eastern Byzantine Empire, which was very worried about the military threat to it from the Seljuk Turks. So if the Christians did not respond, the Muslims would have conquered all of Europe and wiped out Christianity from the planet. Today we would all be bowing to Mecca instead of worshipping Jesus.      See other recommended books  here      Proverbs 30:4 (  700 B.C.  ): "Who hath ascended up into heaven or descended? Who hath gathered the wind in His fists? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath established all the ends of the Earth? What is His name, and    what is His son's name  , if thou canst tell?"  (Psalm 2:11-12)  Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.  Kiss the Son , lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.
