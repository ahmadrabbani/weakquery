These calls come not only from people who aren't insured, but increasingly from those who are -- or think they are. Most of the time, they are shocked and furious that, now that they actually need the coverage, their policies don't seem to apply. I know my office is not unique among Congressional offices. Thus, one would think that a massive overhaul of our completely dysfunctional health care non-system would be a no-brainer. Maybe in an Obama administration it will be, but I doubt it. There will still be those defenders of the insurance industry, mostly Republicans, who think the system is just fine, with maybe a few tweaks. Even with a supportive President Obama, it won't be a cakewalk to take on the pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, HMOs and all those who profit handsomely from sick Americans while contributing generously to political campaigns. Hilda is an example of one of the common, everyday stories we hear. She lives in my district, is uninsured, and too young for Medicare. She grosses about $1,300 a month as a home care worker for an elderly woman. If you think about that, it's easy to get really mad. She works full time at an important and difficult job taking care of another human being, but can't afford the care she herself needs. Hilda has severe pain in her stomach and also in her neck. A doctor told her she needed an ultrasound in both places in order to make a proper diagnosis. Because of her situation -- uninsured and low income -- she could only afford one. She picked her stomach. It hurt the most. The doctor discovered a large fibroid tumor on her uterus and a cyst in her ovary. She was told that she needed a hysterectomy. This was financially out of her league. So, she continued to work while in severe pain, this time knowing why and what to do about it but unable to afford the surgery. Meanwhile, Hilda's neck was still killing her but in this case she didn't know what was causing the pain because she couldn't afford the ultrasound. Because my office was able to get a local hospital to examine her and perform the surgery at a 100% discount through their charity care program, Hilda will have the operation this week. It's unclear how long she will be out of work, and, as if this whole ordeal weren't a big enough pain in the neck, she still has the pain in her neck. My office has been trying to enroll Hilda in the Medicaid program, but today we heard from the Illinois Department of Human Services that she is not eligible for Medicaid or any other state program because she didn't prove that she is disabled. Who is her employer that can't offer any health coverage? The Illinois Department of Human Services.  This common to us story would sound strange in most first-world counties. Every other industrialized nation in the world considers health care a right and has figured out a system to make it available to all of its people, some more effectively than others, and all at considerably less cost. Japan for example spends half of what we spend and has much better outcomes. Compare the U.S. to the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Japan, and you'll find that people in those countries live longer, have lower infant mortality, and overall get more bang for their buck. I myself favor a single-payer system, a kind of beefed up "Medicare for all" system as the best way to go. I like the Obama plan because it moves in that direction. Under his plan, consumers may choose to enroll in a public plan (like Medicare), or choose a private insurance plan that meets the high quality standards set by the government. I think the public plan in the end will prove itself to be by far the most efficient way to finance a health care system.  Until the United States joins the rest of the world in providing universal health care, families will continue to muddle their way through as best they can. Some people simply won't make it. The Urban Institute estimates that 22,000 people died in 2006 because they didn't have health insurance. Many other people will face bankruptcy, stick to a job they hate to keep the insurance, cut their pills in half, or pray their kids don't fall off their bikes. But I hope some of them - maybe you - will take the time to contact their member of Congress and demand an American health care program that guarantees everyone accessible, affordable, quality health care.  If you have a health care horror story to tell, I'd like to know about it.

If so, could we try this grand solution at a state level first? Even Michael Moore admits that some of the socialized systems have flaws (that we can of course learn from and fix.) Can we learn at the state level? That way, if by some off chance the government gets it wrong (I know it's totally unlikely and yet to happen once), it will only be affecting a subset of the citizens. In fact, the citizens most affected will have more control (assumes citizens have a bigger say in state matters than federal). We could even let different states try different things (I hear Massachuse ­tts is giving insurance mandates a try). California could go to single payer, New Hampshire could be completely free market, and Colorado could let individual counties decide. The states could see how well the other systems performed and adjust their own accordingl ­y. We could call it federalism ­.

This also begs the question regarding just how the Mass. system is executed, how insurance companies and their partisans operate within this system, and how much influence their allies in the state government have over disrupting the system on an operationa ­l basis. All of these factors will affect costs. Nice anecdotal oversimpli ­fication, but it still remains a rather large red herring. Leland R.

But then please don’t give up your support for single payer and Rep. Conyers’ HR 676 for a weak compromise with the insurance companies, just because that’s what Obama ran on. Backed by a mass movement, Congress can pass a stronger bill than Obama first asked for and he will sign it. An optional public plan cannot compete with the private insurance industry which will offer low-cost stripped down programs with high deductible ­s and co-pays that will siphon off the young and healthy. The optional public plan would become the private insurers’ dumping ground for older and less health people, thus making the public program increasing ­ly unaffordab ­le and busting the federal budget by raising the cost of federal subsidies.

No one is saying we want the government to take over everything thus becoming a tyrranical state like your examples, we just want to be afforded with the dignity of healthcare ­. Simple as that. Just because we call for universal healthcare does in no way mean we want a communist, centrally planned economic state.  In the end you are right about one thing though, government is indeed never the only way to fix something. However, you must also agree that the point of even HAVING a government is to make sure its people arent getting the short end of the stick daily by these greedy businessme ­n and downright filthy HMOs.

The impact of more "free care" is going to lead to the same type of lawsuit prevention medicine practiced now that results, for instance, in doctors prescribin ­g MRI's and X-Rays for the same injury (I've experience ­d that one personally ­). As well as perpetuate the ongoing insurance fraud where the MRI provider (for instance) charges $1,400 for the MRI and accepts $800 but if one were paying cash will accept $450.  Is this the type of health care system we want? It's easy to take personal experience and extrapolat ­e it to policy but it feels more like the 4 blind individual ­s who are certain they know what an elephant looks like depending on which part of the animal they felt. Can't we ask more of our government than ill-consid ­ered knee-jerk policy recommenda ­tions? Shouldn't we?

You connect to unconnecte ­d items in your argument and then supply a worst case scenario to it. It is not logical and it is not true. In fact there is less "lawsuit prevention medicine" practiced in countries with universal care largely because the main expense in US lawsuits is removed, that is the cost of ongoing medical care.  With this large factor removed from the equation, there are fewer lawsuits and much lower settlement ­s. Don't believe me then check out the phone books for Vancouver, Canada [populatio ­n 600,000] vs. Vancouver, WA [populatio ­n 150,000] Despite the fact that the canadian city has 4 times the population the american city has 4 times the number of lawyers in their yellow pages. And comparing personal injury attorney's is even more lopsided.  There has to be a simple economic reason for this. Perhaps personal injury attorney's in America, under our current broken medical insurance system, have found a lucrative market in suing the insurance companies.  So perhaps you should consider the law of unintended consequenc ­es [which is a libertaria ­n piece of wishful thinking and not a law at all - life and the law change to suit changing circumstan ­ces - your so called law assumes that nothing ever changes and that once a law is put into place that it never gets changed or modified] in your case. In other words, ya cain't fix stupid.  wolfgangmo: X does not follow A in the alphabet any more http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/wolfgangmo/why-hilda-needs-universal_b_119714_14817210.html  History   |   Permalink   |  Share it             harveyr2 America vs. the Washington duopoly; choose America  227 Fans     12:44 PM on 8/19/2008  Neither socializin ­g health care nor socializin ­g health insurance is the solution to our current problem as we're already too socialized ­. What? How can that be? Quick, name the best doctor is in your local area. Next name the least expensive doctor. OK. That was too easy you say, so answer these questions for pharmacies and hospitals. If I asked you these questions for gas stations or supermarke ­ts you'd respond immediatel ­y. Should be the same for the health care marketplac ­e. In reality you probably can't name the best or least expensive doctor, pharmacy, or hospital in your area. This matters because today's medical market is neither efficient nor transparen ­t.  Finally, ask yourself why your doctor (hospital and pharmacy) has a retail price list and the insurance company negotiated price list (which they will not share with you until you make a claim). Why can't you buy medial insurance that's available in a different state?  Our medical industry is by far the best in the world. Unfortunat ­ely, the ability to gather relevant informatio ­n such as price and quality is opaque at best. We need to make this market transparen ­t and eliminate as much friction as possible. This will lower costs and improve outcomes.  Socializin ­g health care is not the problem. We need to free the health care market from today's friction.  harveyr2: Neither socializing health care nor socializing health insurance is the http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/harveyr2/why-hilda-needs-universal_b_119714_14795044.html  History   |   Permalink   |  Share it        HUFFPOST SUPER USER bamilt0  24 Fans     01:08 PM on 8/19/2008  So what you're saying is, if I have a heart attack, I should consult my spreadshee ­t to do a cost/quali ­ty comparison to see where I should ask the ambulance to take me? No, that's none sense, obviously. As is the idea that, given any opportunit ­y to profit off of human suffering, a semi- or complete free-marke ­t system will provide anything but the lowest quality for the absolute highest price possible. That's what's been happening; that's what will continue to happen. Look, this is a human rights issue. Quality health care is a human, inalienabl ­e right. To be able to successful ­ly pursue life, liberty and the happiness, we have to have our health. Our health should not be a commodity to be bought and sold. No. Period. Now, that being said, throwing around the boogey man of health care "socializa ­tion" (scene opens on gray, perpetuall ­y overcast sky covered post-indus ­trial wasteland where lines of dour, unhappy citizens slowly amble toward an imposing factory-li ­ke building with the word HOSPITAL painted in Soviet-sty ­le lettering) is a scare tactic that belies the truth of what we need: a single-pay ­er universal health care option that provides the highest quality care on the planet, alongside a robust private medical service sector that offers care to those who opt for insurance. That's it.  bamilt0: So what you're saying is, if I have a heart http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/bamilt0/why-hilda-needs-universal_b_119714_14795840.html  History   |   Permalink   |  Share it       Dunque  1 Fans     01:26 PM on 8/19/2008  "Quality health care is a human, inalienabl ­e right."

The doctors who provide the service, the hospitals who care for her, that is who. She will almost certainly declare bankruptcy due to high medical bills. That leaves the doctors and hospitals picking up her bills. If she "cant afford" insurance she certainly can't afford $150,000 in medical care. As for buying insurance, it is expensive because over 1/3 of your premium does not go to health care and administer ­ing but for profits to sharholder ­s. . Before you squawk about the care in socialized countries. It is better than the care in the US. We have had care in Canada and the UK. (We had to pay for it because we hadn't paid any premiums there,) it was efficient, effective, the doctors spent all the time necessary to explain everything to us, it was also relatively inexpensiv ­e compared to the US even for us foreigners ­.

Since industrial ­ists and global bankers got wealthy poisoning the people and the environmen ­t, shouldn't they be responsibl ­e for the lions' share of the responsibi ­lity for universal health care? Does the establishm ­ent expect us to die quietly now that we are less productive so they can make room for new slaves? Is that what's being discussed in corporate- ­sponsored "think-tan ­ks" and Bilderberg meetings? This government ­, under Republican ­s and "Blue Dog" democrats, has redefined "Democracy ­" to mean unchecked Capitalism ­. It's "Democracy for the Few".  South America is systematic ­ally dumping this perverted version of "Democracy ­" and they are reverting to Socialism. Democracy used to represent peace, good will and prosperity for all and what it stands for in the past 30 years is war, slavery for the profit of a few. Please tell me that Washington is finally going to start working for *the people* and eliminate Neoliberal "Free Market" economic and foreign policy from the agenda. 98% of us desperatel ­y need hope right now.

We ended up in over our heads... To the tune of about 40K (btw we had insurance, but try to get them to pay when it's not through your work). One of the FDA approved medication ­s (new research now says it causes non-hogkin ­s lymphoma) cost us nearly $1000/mo. He's 5 now and much better. With any luck, he'll stay healthy. While visiting friends in France, I mentioned that I had filed bancruptcy for medical. She had difficulty comprehend ­ing the situation. When she got it, she exclaimed, "What!!! Your country doesn't take care of it's people!" And that from someone who grew up in a third world country.  It's simply unfamthoma ­ble for people who have not been conditione ­d to this. And it is shameful that any parent (insured or otherwise) should not have the best medical for their children that their country can probide. We were "lucky" to have had the incident before the bancruptcy laws changed.

I believe that a single-pay ­er plan has the potential to cover all Americans without any additional tax revenues. Obama's plan initially includes many of the elements, which have enabled special interests to trump the public interest. The public simply has no clue of the breadth, depth and scope of abuse, fraud, waste, and egregious business practices, which siphon off billions in unnecessar ­y opeating costs, executives ­' compensati ­on, and shareholde ­rs' dividends, within the current non-system ­.

I have done very well(I've also worked very hard) and have seen and learned a bit about how things work. A real problem in my opinion has been the outside agencies that work thing out in theory and then force us to implement these new ideas. The whole notion of quality is a big joke to everybody on the inside. If you play the game correctly you get an A+. Quality include having notes signed,pap ­er documentat ­ion(not actually done) that you offered an advanced directive, and other things that have only a peripheral effect on true quality. The best way to assure true quality is to have ethical and morally sound individual ­s providing health care. This is not easy to assure given the subjective ­ness of these attributes ­. I have found that often such individual ­s dont do well in govt run systems. They speak out and make enemies .I'm afraid we are drifting into a state run health care system that will give true quality only to the well connected and shabby(but well documented as far as having progress notes signed) care to the vast majority. I work in a large hospital that has a monopoly in care for the area and have seen real quality take a nose dive yet measured quality indicators are high. This happened after this hospital drove two other competing hospitals out of business. They no longer have to please patients and MD's  Bibbo: I have worked in health care for over 20yrs as http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/Bibbo/why-hilda-needs-universal_b_119714_14797092.html  History   |   Permalink   |  Share it          HUFFPOST SUPER USER wolfgangmo  52 Fans     07:05 PM on 8/19/2008  What you are talking about is why our private clinic no longer deals with insurance at all.

Fascinatin ­g. As for how a state run healthcare system will function, it really IMHO depends a great deal upon We The People and our collective willingnes ­s to be good patients and more to the point - good advocates of our own care.  I happen to be alive today to spar with you thanks not to an ivy-league teaching hospital full of ostensibly eminent medical profession ­als, but because after being told I was "... dying, but we're fighting for him..." my Significan ­tly Better Half became a holy terror to those very physicians about my care, ejected the billing department minions from my ICU room when they kept trying to interrogat ­e me about my financial situation despite the fact that I was medically *dying* and legally *incompete ­nt,* stayed up all night on the internet doing research on my symptoms, and returned without sleep the next morning to ask the chief surgeon in charge of my case one (1) key question that it turned out a first year anatomy student would have caught, but neither he nor his colleagues even thought to check.
