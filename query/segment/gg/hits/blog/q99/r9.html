<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health care has emerged as perhaps the most urgent issue in 

America, and health care reform as the most ambitious initiative in 

domestic policy since the New Deal. Japan, on the other hand, already 

boasts the world's lowest infant mortality rate and longest life 

expectancy, while achieving more success than America at containing 

medical costs: in 1991, spending on health care accounted for a mere 

6.6 percent of Japan's total gross domestic product versus 13.4 percent 

of America's. How does Japan do it? What aspects of the Japanese model 

might be applicable to the United States?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explore these questions, on Friday, 

April 30, 1993, the Japan Society organized a one-day conference entitled 

Making Universal Health Care Affordable: How Japan Does It. Three 

distinguished panels of Japanese and American health care specialists 

discussed the management of Japan's universal health care coverage, ways 

to balance quality care and cost containment, and how the United States 

might profit from Japan's experience. Professor Victor Rodwin was one of 

the conference participants (see Appendix 3) and agreed to draw on the 

conference discussions as a starting point for this more extensive 

monograph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japan Society is grateful to KPMG Peat Marwick; New York Pharma 

Forum; the International Leadership Center on Longevity and Society (U.S.) 

of The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, an affiliate of The City 

University of New York; the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare; and

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International study is gaining recognition as a useful method of 

inquiry into questions of how best to allocate national resources to 

improve health. Yet policy analysis of the Japanese system of health care 

remains underdeveloped.. Indeed, serious debates regarding health care 

reform strategies for the United States often exclude references to 

Japanese health care delivery and financing. This exclusion is 

unfortunate and obscures some outstanding successes of health policy in 

Japan. For instance, in only 20 years and starting from a level similar 

to the United States, Japan has achieved the lowest infant mortality rate 

in the world. The United States remains 19th among developed nations. 

Japan became the world's leader through a well-thought-out plan for 

prevention, coupled with government investment. Now, Japanese policy 

leaders are turning their attention to the elderly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States and Japan face similar 

problems. Both countries face a demographic revolution in the decades 

ahead as the population ages. Medical expenditures, as a proportion of 

GNP, are increasing at similar rates. Both governments face fiercely 

competing demands for resource allocation among prevention, treatment and 

basic science interest groups. Both medical care systems face a diverse 

mix of patients with increasing rates of functional disability. Both 

systems are financed by a large number of employer-based private insurance 

plans in addition to public insurance for the poor and the elderly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this information era, we face a world 

hungry to know what works in health care and what it costs. One of 

medicine's great challenges is to inform policy-makers and the public of 

long-term produc tive benefits and costs to our society of preventing and 

postponing disability. Many initiatives in the United States will require 

fundamental change. The most cost effective will be those targeted with 

sensitivity and respect for cultural tradition to reach the myriad of 

groups in our pluralistic society. Enlarging our understanding of 

socio-cultural patterns of health behavior, disease and economic 

productivity and costs calls for increasing international communication 

and research partnerships.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Rodwin and his associates provide an 

excellent overview of the health care system in Japan. This comprehensive 

and well-documented monograph will serve as an essential reference for 

policy leaders and researchers alike who are interested in pursuing 

comparative policy analysis. The Japan Society is to be commended for 

organizing this timely conference. Professor Rodwin, a leading expert in 

the comparative analysis of health systems, has taken the conference 

presentations and discussions and used them as a springboard for his own 

further investigation of political and economic aspects of Japan's health 

care system. In this monograph, he presents a clear and well-organized 

perspective on what the United States can learn from Japan. Let us hope 

that the challenges Professor Rodwin raises will be met in the years 

ahead as we pursue health care reform to achieve the goals of 

effectiveness, efficiency and equity.</p></td></tr></table>

<tr><td>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan's health care system is characterized by 

universal coverage, free choice of health care providers by patients, a 

multi-payer, employment-based system of financing, and a predominant role 

for private hospitals and fee-for-service practice. Virtually all 

residents of Japan are covered without regard to any medical problems 

they may have (so-called predisposing conditions) or to their actuarial 

risk of succumbing to illness. Premiums are based on income and ability 

to pay. Although there is strong government regulation of health care 

financing and the operation of health insurance, control of the delivery 

of care is left largely to medical professionals and there appears to be 

no public concern about health care rationing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Australian, Canadian and many European health care systems, 

Japan's national health insurance program is compulsory. But Japan 

surpasses all 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic 

Cooperation and Development (OECD) in life expectancy at birth and also 

has the lowest infant mortality rate (Appendix 1, Table 1).<A href="#intro1"><sup>1</sup></A> 

It achieves these successes at a cost of only 6.6 percent of gross 

domestic product, $1,267 per capita - half that of the United States 
<A href="#healthtable1">(Table 1)</a>
.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japanese-style national health insurance raises a fascinating 

question: how has Japan reduced financial barriers of access to medical 

care and achieved a No. 1 ranking on health status at a cost that is 

among the lowest of wealthy industrialized nations?<A href="#intro2"><sup>2</sup></A> In 

addressing this question, we begin with a comparative analysis of health 

care resources and the use of medical care in Japan, the United States 

and other OECD countries. Next, we review the financing and organization 

of medical care in Japan, evaluate some strengths and weaknesses of the 

health care system, and explore possible lessons for health care reform 

in the United States.<p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In adopting this comparative approach to 

health care reform in the United States, we have relied on an extensive 

review of the English-language literature on Japan's health care system 

and on information presented at the Japan Society's April 30 conference, 

"Making Universal Health Care Affordable: How Japan Does It."<A href="#intro3"><sup>3</sup></A> 

We do not presume to have analyzed Japan's health care system in depth. 

For example, we remain intrigued by Japan's exemplary health status and 

by such societal values and traditions as egalitarianism and consensus-

building upon which the health system is built. We have aimed, in earnest, 

to raise more questions than we are able to answer. We hope that these 

questions may lend a sense of perspective to the on-going public debate 

on health care reform in the United States.</p>

UTILIZATION</div></font></b></td></tr>

<tr><td>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan has 15.8 inpatient hospital beds per 

1,000 persons, the highest number among OECD countries and more than 

three times the American ratio <A href="#healthtable1">(Table 1)</a>. By contrast, with 1.6 physicians 

per 1,000 population, Japan has the fifth lowest physician-per-person 

ratio, 43 percent <i>less</i> than the American rate of 2.3 per 1,000 <A href="#healthtable1">(Table 1)</a>. 

Japan also has one-half to one-third the American number of intensive care 

beds per capita <A href="#healthtable1">(Table 1)</a>. And Japan is tied with Austria for the lowest 

hospital staffing ratio (that is, the number of employees per bed) among 

OECD countries (Appendix 1, Table 3).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the use of these resources, at 8.3 

percent, Japan admits a smaller proportion of its population to hospitals 

every year than any other OECD country except Turkey, a rate barely over 

one-half that of the United States <A href="#healthtable1">(Table 1)</a>. On the other hand, of all 

OECD countries, at 50.5 days, Japan has the longest average length of 

stay for inpatient hospital services, more than five times that of the 

United States <A href="#healthtable1">(Table 1)</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Japan has one of the lowest 

physician-to-population ratios among OECD countries (Appendix 1, Table 3), 

at 12.9, Japanese doctors have the highest number of physician contacts 

per capita, more than twice the American rate . It must be noted, <A href="#healthtable1">(Table 1)</a>
however, that the average length of a physician visit in Japan is only 6.9 

minutes, compared to over 20 minutes in the United States.<A href="#health1"><sup>1</sup></A></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that OECD data are available on hospital admission 

rates for selected procedures, with the exception of appendectomies, 

Japan's rates are lower than those in the United States (Table 2).<A href="#health2"><sup>2</A></SUP> 

Comparative survey data indicate that surgeons in Japan perform fewer 

than one-fourth the number of operations per capita that their colleagues 

in the United States do <A href="#healthtable1">(Table 1)</a>.<A href="#health3"><sup>3</sup></A> This pattern is supported by findings 

on cesarean section rates, which are half as frequent in Japan as in the 

United States.<A href="#health4"><sup>4</sup></A> The United States is known abroad for its unusually high 

cesarean section rate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be wrong to conclude from these data 

that Japan rations high-tech medical care. On the contrary, among OECD 

countries, Japan has the highest number of computerized axial tomography 

(CT) scanners per capita, the highest number of extra-corporal shock wave 

lithotriptors per capita, and the highest number of patients per million 

treated for end-stage renal disease failure.<A href="#health5"><sup>5</sup></A> 

In addition, Japanese spend more than any other nation on drugs as a 

percent of total health expenditures, more than twice the American 

rate.<A href="#health6"><sup>6</sup></A></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japanese doctors' clear preference for non-invasive procedures is 

demonstrated by the kinds of medical technologies imported and exported. 

Equipment requiring invasive operations (e.g., pacemakers and artfficial 

heart valves) is almost all imported, whereas diagnostic equipment 

(e.g., CT scanners) is produced in Japan and exported in large 

quantities.<A href="#health7"><sup>7</sup></A></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the United States, Japan's low 

rate of hospital admissions <A href="#healthtable1">(Table 1)</a> reflects its tendency to emphasize 

ambulatory over inpatient hospital care.<A href="#health8"><sup>8</sup></A> But once hospitalization 

occurs, as we have seen, Japan holds the OECD record for long lengths of 

stay and low hospital staffing ratios (Appendix 1, Tables 3 and 4). This 

is encouraged by a reimbursement system that pays hospitals on a per 

diem basis and a style of medical practice that emphasizes bed rest and 

complete recovery while a patient is still in the hospital.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond these more measurable differences in 

resource availability and use of medical care in Japan and United States, 

there are a host of political-institutional and cultural factors that 

reinforce each health care system's distinctiveness. The United States is 

a federal system whose 50 states have significant autonomy on matters of 

health insurance and public health policies. Although the federal 

government exercises a dominant role over the Medicare program and 

regulatory aspects of health policy, Americans are multiethnic, 

suspicious of excessive governmental authority and inclined to solve 

social problems at the local level. Japan is a centralized, unitary 

state with a highly homogeneous population and a tradition of powerful 

state intervention in the economy, including its many health insurance 

plans.</p>

1991, there were 945 patients per million treated for end stage renal

data file, 1993).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="health6"></a><sup>6</sup>lglehart (1988) reports that in 1981 
reimbursement for drugs by Japanese health insurance was equal to 38.7 
percent of all health expenditures and that in 1987 this figure dropped 
to 28 percent. More recent data from OECD Health Systems: Facts and 
Trends (Paris: OECD, 1992) indicate that this figure has dropped to 18.4 
percent, in contrast to the U.S. figure of 8.3 percent. However, these 
data exclude pharmaceutical expenditures for inpatients, which are 
substantial. Ikegami (1990) reports that "about 30 percent of Japan's 
personal health expenditures are for drugs," which we assume include 
inpatient drugs, and supports the contention that the Japanese are among 
the highest spenders on drugs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of pharmaceutical expenditures per 
capita, in U.S. dollar pharmaceutical purchasing power parities, 
Japanese spent $332 per capita, Americans $182. However, if these 
expenditure data are adjusted by GDP purchasing power parities, the 
difference narrows: $179 for Japan, $182 for the United States.<br>

<b><font size="+1"><div align="center">HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND
NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE</div></font></b><br><br></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>The evolution of national health insurance</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National health insurance emerged in Japan as 

the result of a gradual process that can be traced back to 1905, when the 

Kamegafuchi Textile Company provided limited benefits for its employees.<a href="#financing1"><sup>1</sup></a> 

In the decades that followed, more and more corporations began offering 

benefits through mutual aid societies. A health insurance law enacted in 

1922 was inspired by the German system established by Chancellor Bismarck 

in 1883. As in Germany, this first law extended health insurance coverage 

to industrial workers and miners but excluded the self-employed and 

employees in companies with fewer than five workers.<a href="#financing2"><sup>2</sup></a> This law, 

implemented in 1927, established the practice of mandating coverage by 

enterprises and created an important government role in the provision of 

health insurance to those individuals not covered by employers. In 1938, 

health insurance was extended to farmers, fishermen, foresters and other 

groups not covered by the 1922 law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After World War II, the effort to rebuild Japan 

gave new impetus to the achievement of universal coverage. In 1958, the 

1938 law was revised to include the remaining 30 percent of the 

population not previously covered. This revision broke the precedent of 

extending health insurance to occupational groups by calling for 

universal coverage on the basis of residence. Every government 

jurisdiction, whether city, town or village, was required to provide 

health insurance to every uncovered resident by 1961. Since 1961, 

virtually all Japanese have been covered by either employers or the 

government.</p>
<br>
<b>Health care financing</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health insurance expenditures in Japan are 

financed by payroll taxes paid by employers and employees and by 

income-based premiums paid by the self-employed. In contrast to the 

United States, where the federal, state and local governments finance 

roughly 42.9 percent of all health care expenditures and out-of-pocket 

payments contribute another 22 percent, in Japan, only 31.7 percent of 

national health care expenditures derive from national and local public 

funds and 12.2 percent from out-of-pocket payments. The largest share of 

health care financing in Japan is raised by means of compulsory premiums 

levied on individual subscribers (34.6 percent) and employers (21.7 

percent).<a href="#financing3"><sup>3</sup></a> This employment-based share of health care financing in Japan 

(56.4 percent) raised by means of voluntary employer, employee and 

individual subscriber premiums in the United States <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/rodwin/financingfigure.html">(Figure 1)</a>.</p>
<br>
<b>The structure of the national health insurance system</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance, understanding the system 

seems to be an impossible task. Japan's national health insurance program 

is made up of some 2,000 private insurers and more than 3,000 units of 

government. The system can be simplified, however, by distinguishing 

between two broad groups of beneficiaries <a href="#appen2fig1">(Appendix 2, Figure 1)</a>:1) 

employees and their dependents, including some elderly dependents 

(65 percent of the population); and 2) the self-employed, unemployed, 

elderly and their dependents (35 percent of the population).<a href="#financing4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignoring some administrative complexities and 

small beneficiary groups, health insurance plans for employees may be 

categorized into four groups:<br></p>

<ol>
	<li>Government-managed plans - These plans provide coverage for the almost 30 percent of the population comprised of employees (and their dependents) of small enterprises with more than five but fewer than 300 employees. These plans are managed by the government's Social Insurance Agency through a network of some 300 local offices. Premium contributions are set by law at a fixed rate (8.2 percent of monthly income before taxes) and evenly split between employees and employers.
	<li>Society-managed plans - Known as health insurance societies, more than 1,800 company plans provide coverage for 26 percent of the population. These health insurance societies are managed jointly by representatives of labor and management in enterprises with more than 300 employees. Society-managed plans can be also established by several enterprises employing 3,000 or more employees. Payroll taxes for such plans range from 5.8 to 9.5 percent of gross monthly income.<a href=
	"#financing5"><sup>5</sup></a> Employers are required to pay at least half of these contributions, and some pay as much as 80 percent.
	<li>Mutual aid association (MAA) insurers - Covering almost 10 percent of the population, these include 27 plans for government employees in the national public service, 54 plans for local government employees, and one plan for quasi-public employees like teachers and other school employees. The average payroll contribution of these plans in 8.5 percent of the employee's wage.
	<li>Plans for day laborers (for those who work less than two months during the year) and seaman - These independent plans cover only 0.1 and 0.4 percent of the population, respectively.
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the employee groups noted above, 

employees in enterprises with fewer than five workers, the self-employed 

and retirees are covered either by municipal governments or by national 

health insurance societies. Roughly 3,000 municipal governments cover 

over 90 percent of such self-employed individuals as farmers, 

shopkeepers, their dependents, and a large number of elderly people on 

pensions. There are also 166 national health insurance societies that 

directly manage plans for certain trade and occupational groups such as 

physicians, lawyers, dentists, food retailers, carpenters, and barbers. 

Contributions to these national health insurance societies are based on 

reported income and assets as well as on the number of individuals per 

household.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to health insurance for employees, 

municipal governments and national health insurance societies receive no 

direct contributions from employers. Moreover, the self-employed and 

retirees earn less on average than employees in large enterprises, so the 

government ends up paying slightly less than 50 percent of their health 

insurance expenditures - four-twelfths by the national government and one-

twelfth each by prefectures and municipalities.<a href="#financing6"><sup>6</sup></a> Once the elderly reach 

the age of 70 (or 65 if bedridden), since they use the lion's share of 

health care resources but do not pay premiums, under the Health Services 

System for the Elderly the other half of their expenses are financed by 

taxes on premium payments to all insurers of employees and the self-

employed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of Japan's health insurance plans are 

private organizations in terms of administrative law; in practice, they 

have a quasi-public status insofar as they are largely bound to provide 

uniform benefits and to cover all eligible beneficiaries. All employers 

with at least five employees are mandated by law to insure them (along 

with their dependents). Employers have little freedom to alter premium 

levels, which range from 5.8 to 9.5 percent of the wage base.<a href="#financing7"><sup>7</sup></a> The self-

employed are required to contribute premiums to health insurance plans 

that are administered by local governments or trade associations. And all 

of these premiums are taxed to finance the national fund which, along 

with government subsidies, finances national health insurance for the 

elderly.</p>
<br>
<b>The extent and regulation of health insurance benefits</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health insurance benefits are designed to 

provide basic medical care to the maximum number of individuals. Although 

there are exceptions, mandated benefits are similar across the four 

groups of employee plans and for the self-employed and retirees. They 

include ambulatory and hospital care, extended care, most dental care 

and prescription drugs. Not covered are such items as abortion, cosmetic 

surgery, most traditional medicine (including acupuncture), certain 

hospital amenities, some high-tech procedures, and childbirth.<a href="#financing8"><sup>8</sup></a> 

Expenses that fall outside the normal boundaries of medical care are 

either not covered, dealt with on a case-by-case basis, or covered by the 

welfare system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differences between plans include the level of 

copayments, the amount of cash benefits, and the extent of cross-

subsidization and government subsidies <a href="#appen2figs2+3">(Appendix 2, Figures 2 and 3)</a>. 

With regard to copayments, all plans for employees have a 10 percent rate 

for plan members and their dependents, a 20 percent rate for inpatient 

care, and a 30 percent rate for outpatient care. For the self-employed 

and their dependents, the copayment rate is 30 percent for both inpatient 

and outpatient care. For the retired, the copayment rate is 20 percent, 

and for their dependents, the rate is 20 percent for inpatient care and 

30 percent for outpatient care. But under Japan's system of catastrophic 

health insurance, there is a monthly ceiling for each beneficiary on all 

copayments for all health insurance plans.<a href="#financing9"><sup>9</sup></a> This has limited private 

insurance to coverage of copayments. There is, however, a small market 

for supplemental benefits that pay for amenities like private rooms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health insurance plans for employees provide 

cash benefits for extended sickness and injury and for maternity leave 

and delivery expenses. National health insurance plans for the self-

employed and retirees provide cash benefits for midwifery and general 

expenses. Cash benefits can be substantial. Nearly $2,400 is provided to 

cover child delivery expenses under most employee plans, for example.<a href="financing10"><sup>10</sup></a> 

If the mother is the primary beneficiary, the cash benefit may be 50 

percent of her monthly salary. Maternity leave amounts to 100 days and is 

compensated at 50 percent of a mother's salary in the case of working 

women. In the event of prolonged sickness or disability, an individual 

collects 60 percent of monthly remuneration for 18 months.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Society-managed plans provide more extensive 

benefits in kind. In addition to providing the cash benefits noted above, 

74 percent of these plans also have a "patient cost-sharing restoration" 

program which picks up a portion of the mandatory 10 percent copayment.<a href="#financing11"><sup>11</sup></a> 

Society-managed plans are also actively involved in health screening and 

promotion. Enterprises own and operate more than 3,500 sanitoriums, 1,000 

gymnasiums and 300 health centers, for example.<a href="#financing12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is thus a widely held perception that 

employees of large corporations covered under society-managed plans are 

getting a "better deal." There is no evidence that these beneficiaries 

enjoy better health status, however. As John Campbell noted at the Japan 

Society conference, among all plans, individuals enrolled in society-

managed plans receive the least value back for what they pay. For every 

dollar paid in premium contributions, only 62 cents is received in health 

insurance benefits. The beneficiaries of government-managed plans receive 

84 cents in benefits for every dollar of premiums paid, the self-employed 

receive $1.66, and retirees receive $4 to $5.<a href="#financing13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<br>
<b>Government subsidies and cross-subsidization between plans</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age and income disparities among health insurance 

plans result in an unequal distribution of health risks. Plans that 

insure beneficiaries who are older or in higher risk occupational groups 

will incur higher costs and therefore often generate deficits. Given the 

Japanese commitment to equity, these inequalities are reduced through 

government subsidies and cross-subsidization between plans.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of mutual aid associations 

for government employees, all insurance plans receive some form of 

government subsidy. Even society-managed plans, for example, receive 

government funds (Y4.85 billion in 1992) to defray their administrative 

costs. Likewise, government subsidies financed 50 percent of the benefit 

payments to self-employed individuals covered by national health insurance 

<a href="#appen2fig3">(Appendix 2, Figure 3)</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cross-subsidization supports the poorer plans. 

As noted above, the most generous example is the national pool created as 

part of the Health and Medical Service Law for the Aged of 1983. 

Government (national and local) provides 30 percent of this special fund, 

and local governments another 20 percent. The remaining 70 percent comes 

from other insurance plans based upon the total enrollment of retirees in 

each fund.<a href="#financing14"><sup>14</sup></a> As a percentage of their total expenditures, government-

managed plans, society-managed plans and national health insurance plans 

contribute 15.4, 20.4 and 24.2 percent, respectively.<a href="#financing15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<br>
<b>Provider reimbursement</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Japanese national health insurance, all 

insurance plans pay health care providers low fees by American standards 

<a href="#fintab3">(Table 3)</a>. The fees must conform to a uniform national fee schedule known 

as the point-fee system. For any particular service, the same fee is paid 

by all insurers to all providers. As in Canada or Germany, there is no 

"extra-billing": neither physicians nor hospitals may bill their patients 

more than the authorized fee; but illegal side-payments are common and 

condoned. All covered medical procedures are ranked by complexity, and 

neither geographic location, the institutional setting (e.g., type of 

hospital or ambulatory care), the qualification of the provider, nor the 

actual cost of the service are considered in this rating system.<a href="#financing16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical procedures are assigned a number of 

points, each of which is worth 10 yen.<a href="#financing17"><sup>17</sup></a> Only the basic charges for 

hospital room and board services are covered; the costs for additional 

hotel amenities are not covered.<a href="#financing18"><sup>18</sup></a> The fee covers all supplies, 

materials, capital depreciation and personnel costs. There is no 

flexibility in this system of price controls for insurers or for 

providers. Hospitals can bill patients extra only for room and board and 

a restricted number of specialized services, for example.<a href="#financing19"><sup>19</sup></a> As John 

Campbell noted at the conference, "cheap stuff is profitable and 

expensive stuff is unprofitable. A doctor who sees a few extra patients 

and prescribes drugs for them makes money; coronary bypass surgery at an 

urban hospital loses money."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspThe Ministry of Health and Welfare sets 

the fee schedule. Its Central Social Medical Care Council has 20 members 

who represent a cross section of health care interests: eight providers 

(five physicians, two dentists, and one pharmacist), eight payers (four 

insurers, including government representatives, two employers and two 

labor representatives), and four public interest representatives (three 

economists and one lawyer).<a href="#financing20"><sup>20</sup></a> Every other year, this council renegotiates 

the fee schedule with the medical profession, but these negotiations are 

constrained by a rate cap set by the Ministry to limit the overall 

increase in costs. This rate cap results in an effective, if implicit, 

global budget for all health care expenditures.<a href="#financing21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<b><font size="+1"><div align="center">THE ORGANIZATION OF MEDICAL CARE</div></font></b><br><br></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Hospitals</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Japan's relatively high hospital 

bed-to-population ratio (Appendix 1, Table 3), the number of hospital 

beds is not decreasing Between 1970 and 1988, in fact, it increased by 

25.8 percent.<a href="#org1"><sup>1</sup></a> This reflects at least five characteristics of Japan's 

broader health system First, until the late 1980s, few barriers were 

placed on entry into the hospital market in Japan's rapidly growing 

postwar economy. Second the organization of medical care in Japan is 

heavily centered around hospitals. Third, 81 percent of hospitals are 

privately owned, and the) have had few restrictions on their capital 

investments. Fourth because hospitals have competed fiercely with one 

another, expansion has served as a key strategy to gain a competitive 

edge. Finally, al least until the mid 1980s, the Ministry of Health and

Welfare has not played an active role in containing the total number of 

hospital beds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to 90 percent of hospital facilities 

with 20 or more beds are classified as "general hospitals." The remainder 

are mental health facilities or tuberculosis and leprosy centers. General 

hospitals are dominated by small, privately owned and operated 

"nonprofit" facilities. The average number of beds in a Japanese hospital 

is 163 -slightly fewer than the 190 in an average American hospital - and 

half have fewer than 100 beds.<a href="#org2"><sup>2</sup></a> Although the last few years have 

witnessed a proliferation of national hospital chains, the majority of 

small hospitals continue to be privately owned and managed by physicians 

As in public hospitals, physicians in private hospitals are salaried.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 283 beds, the average public hospital is 

larger than its private counterpart. Although 19 percent of hospitals are 

public, they account for 33 percent of all beds. About 75 percent of 

public hospitals are under the jurisdiction of municipal and prefectural 

governments the remainder are national institutions. About 1 percent of 

hospitals are owned and operated by quasi-public agencies and 

organizations such as the Red Cross, social insurance agencies and 

employment related groups.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these distinctions, all hospitals in 

Japan tend to be viewed as recuperative centers rather than as merely 

therapeutic institutions, Even large teaching hospitals do not limit 

themselves to providing acute-care services. Hospitals have traditionally 

functioned, in part, as long-term care facilities. Of the nearly 400 

hospitals that have more than 500 beds, only about 60 percent have adult 

intensive care units, and only 30 percent of them have neonatal intensive 

care units, the majority of which have only five to seven beds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this orientation, patients in 

Japanese hospitals have the longest average length of stay in the world.<a href="#org3"><sup>3</sup></a> 

Even accounting for the lengthy stays of psychiatric patients, the 

average patient's stay in a Japanese hospital far exceeds that of most 

other OECD countries both in the aggregate and by specific disease 

categories (Appendix 1, Table 5). In addition to the nursing home 

functions played by hospitals, other factors accounting for the lengthy 

stays are probably the large number of beds, the low admission rates, the 

per diem form of hospital reimbursement, and the emphasis on recuperation 

over invasive medical and surgical interventions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is the case with intensive care units, 

there are far fewer emergency rooms in Japan than in the United States. 

But while Japan has roughly half the population of the United States, it 

has only 7 percent of the murders, 2 percent of the reported rapes, and 

0.3 percent of the armed robberies, so there would seem to be less of a 

need for extensive trauma facilities.<a href="#org4"><sup>4</sup></a> In addition, unimpeded access to 

health care through the clinic system has the effect of steering 

non-urgent care away from emergency rooms. An integrated system of 

primary, secondary and tertiary-level emergency facilities appears to 

meet the need for emergency and trauma care.<a href="#org5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the United States, university hospitals 

in Japan are centers for research, teaching and the delivery of 

tertiary-level "cutting edge" medical care. In contrast to America's 

129 academic medical centers with an average size of 664 beds, Japan 

has 131 university hospitals (half of them public) with an average size 

of 735 beds.<a href="#org6"><sup>6</sup></a> Despite their larger average size, Japanese teaching 

hospitals have far fewer inpatient admissions, less than 30 percent of 

the American rate. And the 36.2 day average length of stay in these 

hospitals far exceeds the 7.9 days in American teaching hospitals.<a href="#org7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Japanese university hospitals 

generally incur higher costs, they also have shorter lengths of stay and 

higher staffing ratios than other Japanese hospitals. Increasingly, the 

public perceives these facilities as preferred sites for receiving 

medical care.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent innovation for the delivery of 

high-tech medical care has been the establishment of officially 

designated centers for such procedures as open-heart surgery. This 

"Highly Advanced Medical Technology System" provides a mechanism by which 

new medical devices can receive broader use and evaluation despite their 

ineligibility for reimbursement under the normal benefits plan of Japan's 

health insurance program. Most often, highly advanced medical procedures 

are performed at teaching facilities.<a href="#org8"><sup>8</sup></a> For third-party reimbursement to 

be awarded, these procedures must now be performed at these centers, 

which are required to have appropriate equipment and personnel.</p>
<br>
<b>Clinics and Ambulatory Care</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japanese physicians have traditionally 

operated on a small scale, working out of their homes to provide health 

care services to their community. Although these clinics have typically 

provided a low-level intensity of care, many have recently acquired a 

wide range of sophisticated medical equipment including ultrasonic 

testing and gastrointestinal fiberscopes.<a href="#org9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small, privately owned clinics provided most 

outpatient services until the 1970s. In addition, roughly 25,000 

physicians' offices, equipped with up to 19 beds and also referred to as 

"clinics," function as small hospitals. They add 276,000 beds to Japan's 

already high number (15.8 per 1,000 persons), thus increasing the total 

number of hospital beds by 17 percent.<a href="#org10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1970s, clinic physicians have become 

concerned about losing their share of primary-care services to hospitals. 

Although the number of clinics has increased from about 50,000 in 1955 to 

more than 80,800 in 1990, the number of clinics with beds decreased by 

almost 20 percent during the 1970s and 1980s.<a href="#org11"><sup>11</sup></a> Likewise, although the 

number of physicians has increased by 113 percent since 1960, the 

proportion of physicians running clinics has dropped from 44.8 percent in 

1960 to only 27.5 percent in 1990.<a href="#org12"><sup>12</sup></a> This decrease in the number of 

clinics with beds and the proportion of physicians running clinics is due 

largely to direct competition with larger hospitals in outpatient 

services and high land prices that prohibit the establishment of new 

clinic facilities. Larger hospitals are attracting both young doctors and 

outpatients with their sophisticated technology and services.<a href="#org13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the competition between clinics and 

hospitals, two structural aspects of Japan's health care system appear to 

constrain the trend toward specialization and high-tech care and to 

promote primary-care services. First, clinic physicians do not have 

admitting privileges to hospitals. Second, once referred to the hospital, 

many patients do not return to a clinic but continue to be treated by the 

hospital's outpatient department. These barriers give clinic physicians 

an incentive to put off hospitalization.<a href="#org14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the barriers to referring patients to hospitals, two financial 

incentives also appear to support primary-care services. First, clinic 

physicians are remunerated under the fee schedule each time they write a 

prescription for a dispensing pharmacist. Second, they make an average 

profit of 26 percent of the reimbursement rate every time they 

prescribe - and sell - a drug to their patients.<a href="#org15"><sup>15</sup></a> Because pharmaceutical 

manufacturers and wholesalers routinely sell drugs to physicians at 

prices well below the fee schedule's reimbursement rates, drug sales have 

become an important source of profits for clinics.<a href="#org16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average net monthly income for clinic 

physicians was $22,900 in 1990, while specialists based in private 

hospitals earned only $6,300.<a href="#org17"><sup>17</sup></a> A 1985 study indicated that revenues and 

net profits of clinic physicians vary with the quantity of drugs 

prescribed and sold by physicians, the age of the physicians and the size 

of the clinic. This finding supports the contention that clinic 

physicians maximize their income by prescribing and selling more drugs.<a href="#org18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite clinic physicians' practice of selling 

the drugs they prescribe, which strikes most Americans as a blatant 

financial conflict of interest, the doctor-patient relationship 

presumably is based on trust. Patients are typically told little about 

their diagnoses, and doctors explain away problems in "soothing terms 

without necessarily providing precise information about what exactly the 

problem is."<a href="#org19"><sup>19</sup></a> Pills frequently go unlabeled, and patients are not always

told when they are part of an experiment. Such practices were recently 

supported by a court decision that doctors need not share the full 

details of a diagnosis with a cancer patient.<a href="#org20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clinic physician, however, does not provide the kind of primary 

health care so often extolled by family physicians in the United States. 

Most clinic physicians operate in solo practices without hospital 

privileges, thus making it difficult to collaborate with specialists as 

well as with peers. Standards of practice, professional competence and 

patient care are neither monitored nor evaluated in any formal way. 

In addition, as in the United States, Japanese physicians do not 

typically subscribe to the idea of "comprehensive primary health care and 

often fail to respect the person as a whole person operating in a complex 

social and economic environment."<a href="#org21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<br><b>Services for the elderly</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the early 1970s, the elderly enjoyed a 

privileged status in the Japanese welfare state. With the economic growth 

of the 1960s came demands for the expansion of social benefits that could 

not be ignored. In 1973, the government responded to social pressures by 

creating an almost free medical care system for the elderly, the national 

insurance plan administered by local governments. In 1982, in response to 

rising health care costs, the Health and Medical Service Law for the Aged 

established the national pooi to subsidize medical care.<a href="#org22"><sup>22</sup></a> The government 

sought to increase equity in financing by taxing all health insurance 

plans based on a formula related to each plan's number of beneficiaries 

and past medical expenditures on the elderly.<a href="#org23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite universal coverage under national 

health insurance, the range of services designed to meet the needs of the 

elderly is limited. In general wards, no distinction is made between 

acute and long-term care facilities.<a href="#org24"><sup>24</sup></a> A significant fraction of hospital 

beds are routinely occupied by elderly people requiring long-term care. 

Seventy-five percent of the institutionalized elderly are in hospitals 

and clinics, for example, and survey data indicate that 45 percent of 

elderly inpatients are hospitalized for more than six months.<a href="#org25"><sup>25</sup></a> Due to 

the shortage of rehabilitation services, roughly 4.6 percent of the 

elderly population is bedridden.<a href="#org26"><sup>26</sup></a> In 1987, 34 percent of patients in 

Japan's long-term care facilities were bedridden, a striking contrast to 

America's 6.5 percent.<a href="#org27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now a growing number of hospitals 

specializing in treating and caring for the elderly. There are also three 

other types of facilities that serve the elderly in Japan: a small number 

of nursing homes (10 beds per 1,000 elderly persons in 1988, in contrast 

to 46.2 in the United States in 1985), welfare institutions for those who 

need constant care, and facilities providing rehabilitation services.<a href="#org28"><sup>28</sup></a> 

But the relatively limited number of home health aides leads to an 

absence of reliable support services.<a href="#org29"><sup>29</sup></a> Compared to the United States, 

Japan has a far more severe shortage of long-term care services. There 

are long waiting lists for admission to nursing homes-applicants commonly 

wait for more than a year.<a href="#org30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the lack of appropriate institutions 

and support services, at least three other factors contribute to Japan's 

high rate of "social admissions" to hospitals. First, medical practice 

generally tends to emphasize passive care and bed rest. Second, a lack of 

space at home to accommodate elderly relatives pushes more of the frail 

elderly into hospitals and clinics. Finally, women, the traditional care 

givers for the elderly, are entering the work force in increasing 

numbers. Thus, although some 62 percent of the elderly live with their 

children or other relatives, in contrast to less than 33 percent in the 

United States, Japan's institutionalization rate (6.2 percent) is 

comparable to America's.<a href="#org31"><sup>31</sup></a> Where Japan diverges from the United States 

and other OECD countries is in its rapidly graying population. In 2020, 

26 percent of Japanese will be over 65, compared to 17.3 percent of 

Americans.<a href="#org32"><sup>32</sup></a> Because there are already about 700,000 Japanese aged 65 and 

over (4.6 percent of the elderly population) who are so severely disabled 

that they are bedridden or require constant supervision, these 

projections impelled government policy-makers to publish the "Golden Plan" 

and make a commitment to solve this anticipated crisis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Plan is a 10-year national 

health care and welfare plan for the elderly agreed upon by the 

Ministries of Health and Welfare, Finance and Home Affairs in 1989.<a href="#org33"><sup>33</sup></a>

At the Japan Society conference, Ministry of Health and Welfare 

Director-General Nobuharu Okamitsu described it as an attempt to 

integrate welfare services, medical care and insurance in a comprehensive 

manner. The plan outlines an ambitious set of goals at a projected cost 

of $40 billion during the 1990s. This is in contrast to the $11.3 billion 

spent in the 1980s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan relies on four principal strategies 

to build the infrastructure necessary to accommodate the growing needs of the elderly:<br>

<ol>
	<li>Expansion of existing services by increasing the number of home helpers from 40,900 in 1991 to 100,000 in 1999 and the number of nursing home beds from just over 144,600 to 240,000;<a href="#org34"><sup>34</sup></a>
	<li>Creation of a more diverse range of services by defining the respective roles of corporations and of the national, prefectural and municipal governments;
	<li>Decentralization through an increased role for municipalities in the design of programs;
	<li>Reduction of fragmentation by developing government entities to provide services, support research, disseminate information and coordinate the regional administration of model projects.
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to expanding infrastructure for the elderly, the Golden 

Plan seeks to rationalize services. It aims to reduce the geriatric 

population of hospitals and to increase capacity in skilled nursing homes 

and particularly in new institutions known as geriatric rehabilitation 

centers. In addition, it calls for a three-fold increase in 

government-employed visiting homemakers, a 10-fold growth in adult day 


centers, and a 12-fold increase in respite care centers. If the plan is 

implemented, the bedridden elderly will be shifted over the next decade
 
away from hospitals toward home care support services, informal support 
services and nursing homes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has recently adjusted the fee 

schedule's reimbursement rates to encourage those general hospitals that 

provide mostly long-term care for the elderly to become approved 

geriatric hospitals. The fee schedule's per diem rates for long-term care 

in general hospitals have been reduced to provide an incentive for many 

private, medium-sized hospitals to become chronic and geriatric care 

facilities that would be reimbursed on the basis of a more favorable 

geriatric fee schedule.<a href="#org35"><sup>35</sup></a>

<p>Another major change in the reimbursement of medical care for the 

elderly was the reinstatement of copayments. When the elderly were first 

covered under national health insurance in 1961, their copayments were 

set at 50 percent of the allowed fees. Free medical care for the elderly 

was established in 1973 and lasted until 1983. When reinstated, the 

copayment was kept at a low level, far lower than the pre-1970 levels of 

patient contribution.<a href="#org36"><sup>36</sup></a> But cost-sharing for care of the elderly has 

continued to rise. Moreover, the government is now emphasizing programs 

that draw on family resources. In contrast to inpatient services, local 

governments now ask the children of residents in nursing homes and 

geriatric hospitals to contribute toward the cost of care.<a href="#org"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
