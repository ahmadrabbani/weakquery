Ninety percent of my junk mail is from insurance companies asking for my business.  Health insurance companies sponsor some of the most expensive and convincing ads on television.  Do you think it is because they are worried about my health? A single payer universal health care system would save billions of dollars. Instead of spending money on advertising, fraud and billing charges, funds could be directed to care. It would allow doctors to spend more time with patients and less time on bookwork. If people would simply brush away the cobwebs of spin so professionally designed to make us think our government would mangle it, they would see that a universal single payer health plan is the only way to go.  Just like social security, fire and police protection, health care is a right-not a privilege for the few. All the other developed countries have universal health insurance.

What resonated with me about Obama's 30 minute infomercial was when he spoke of his bitterness (my word not his) about his mother having to spend her last days suffering from cancer worrying about health bills rather than focusing on getting well and spending time with her loved ones. It's one of the major reasons I'm voting for Obama. I'm tired of gnashing my teeth about health bills. His plan may not solve all my problems, but I will be happy to know we are absolutely heading in the right direction by moving toward universal coverage. Inappropriate?  Alert us.
