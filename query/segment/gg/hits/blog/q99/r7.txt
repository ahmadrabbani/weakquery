Now is the time to stand up and fight. Put our money and our vote up on the line. Get up on our feet and walk a picket line. Dial a phone or write a letter, Do it so every one will feel better. Why should only rich have medical care?  And the poor should die dont you care? Get out of your chair and in to the street. It is time for us all to vote with our feet. Show and tell politicians, turn up the heat. If we all fight together we can not be beat. The Iraqis get universal health care, The rules of war require that its there. Prisoners in prison get medical care. But not all Americans thats just not fair? What about the hard working poor? They need medical care for sure? The system is broken it profits the greedy. Let us fix the system to serve the needy.   Notes Many thanks to David G. Hurlburt for permission to add this poem to the Union Songs collection.
