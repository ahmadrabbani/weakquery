<h1 align="center">Celebrating Coretta, Who Celebrated Nonviolence - and Stopped Eating Animals</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">By Stephanie Ernst</p>
	<p align="left">This is the day when we annually celebrate the life, spirit, 
	contributions, and philosophy of Martin Luther King Jr. But I'm not going to 
	write about MLK today. I'm going to write, just briefly, about Coretta. 
	Those opposed to the idea of animal rights, those who consider the fight for 
	animal rights to be distinct from and lesser than other social justice 
	movements, and--most clearly--those who consider veganism extreme could 
	learn something from Coretta Scott King.</p>
	<p align="left">For more than the last decade of her extraordinary, compassionate, and 
	passionate life, Coretta Scott King was a vegan. Really. Not an &quot;extremist,&quot; 
	not a &quot;fanatic,&quot; not a &quot;one-note,&quot; &quot;single-issue&quot; zealot 
	- just a vegan.</p>
	<p align="left">In addition to fighting against racial injustices, Coretta Scott King fought 
	openly and loudly for LGBT rights. She opposed war and violence and 
	championed peace. And for the last 15 years of her life, she improved her 
	own health and life and saved hundreds of animals' lives by refusing to eat 
	their bodies or what came from their bodies.</p>
	<p align="left">On her health, she said in Ebony in 2003, &quot;I feel blessed that I was 
	introduced to this lifestyle more than 12 years ago by Dexter. I prefer to 
	eat mostly raw or 'living' foods. The benefits for me are increased energy, 
	a slowing of the aging process, and I have none of the diseases like 
	hypertension, heart disease and diabetes that many people my age seem to 
	get.&quot; And Coretta and Martin Luther King's son Dexter, also a vegan and, as 
	noted, the one who introduced his mother to the lifestyle, considers veg*nism 
	the &quot;logical extension&quot; of his father's philosophy of nonviolence, reported 
	Vegetarian Times in 1995 in the write-up of the magazine's interview with 
	him.</p>
	<p align="left">Every time someone remarks or implies that vegans are nothing but animal 
	rights &quot;fanatics&quot; or health-obsessed neurotics who care about nothing else, 
	who are vegans to the exclusion of caring about or fighting against any 
	other injustices, one of the many people who comes to mind as proving this 
	wrong is Coretta Scott King. So today I remember and honor not only Martin 
	Luther King Jr. but Coretta Scott King as well. If I must be an extremist or 
	a fanatic simply because I am a vegan, then I am at least happy with the 
	company.</p>

		Expediency asks the question, &quot;Is it politic?&quot;<br>
		Vanity asks the question, &quot;Is it popular?&quot;<br>
		But conscience asks the question, &quot;Is it right?&quot;<br>
		And there comes a point when one must take a position that is neither 
		safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one must take it because one's 
		conscience tells one that it is </b></i>right.<br>
