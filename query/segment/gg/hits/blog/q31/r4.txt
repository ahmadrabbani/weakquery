Novelty  rubber base chess boards with cloth surface can be folded and offer greater flexibility for storage. Wooden chess boards can be classy display pieces or practical for playing real games. Usually only championship events provide a wood chess board in competitive play however.  A wood chess board can be perfect for the home or office setting. Veneer wooden chess boards are most common, bringing more style and lower cost of production. This doesn't mean poor quality. It's easier to produce and looks great. Solid hardwood chess boards are always more costly to produce, and are becoming more rare. If a wooden chessboard is not veneer, the hardwoods used will be clearly noted.
