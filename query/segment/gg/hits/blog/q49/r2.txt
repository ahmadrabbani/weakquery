About the Show  As if juggling three wives weren't tricky enough, Season 5 of Emmy�- and Golden Globe-nominated  'Big Love' finds modern polygamist Bill Henrickson (Bill Paxton) tackling problems outside his three-house suburban home  and in public. Bill has built a new church and got himself elected to the State Senate, but some of his loyal followers are skeptical, and the media's glare isn't helping things. It appears unlikely the family will extricate themselves from the politics at the Juniper Creek compound now that Alby Grant (Matt Ross) is in charge. The power struggles between first wife Barb (Jeanne Tripplehorn), second wife Nicki (Chlo� Sevigny) and third wife Margene (Ginnifer Goodwin) continue. And then there are the assorted family dramas involving the growing pains of Bill's eldest, Ben (Douglas Smith), Nicki's daughter, Cara Lynn (Cassi Thomson), their father Frank (Bruce Dern) and mother Lois (Grace Zabriskie). Bold, funny and wholly original,  'Big Love'  continues to explore the evolving institution of marriage through this typically atypical family.
