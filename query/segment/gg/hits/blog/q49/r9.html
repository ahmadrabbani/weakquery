                        Church founder, Joseph Smith, said he received a revelation

                        Doctrine and Covenants Section 132. In the revelation, 
                        the Lord commands him to take virgins &quot;an hundredfold 
                        in this world&quot; for the purpose to &quot;multiply

                        he did not start practicing it until around 1835. See:

                        Brigham Young and Orson Pratt introduced the doctrine

                        Church leader Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto in 
                        1890. Many members were caught by surprise. Only three

                        Yes, church leaders continued the practice. Many top church

                        There is also strong evidence that Church President Wilford

                        Not any more. All church manuals and documents no longer

                        Many do, because the doctrine is still part of official

                        heaven for polygamy. Mormons believe that all children 
                        who die before the age of 8 are "automatic" heirs to the 
                        highest heaven. An analysis indicates that of the 70 billion 
                        people or so that have been born on earth, the gender 
                        ratio has been about 104 males to 100 females. An estimated 
                        47% of males and 44% of females have died before age eight. 
                        That means 1.7 billion more males than females have so 
                        far made it to the highest heaven in Mormon theology.
