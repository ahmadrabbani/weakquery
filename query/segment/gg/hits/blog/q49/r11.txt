By  Rachel Thomas , About.com Guide    March 21, 2011  My Bio  Headlines  Forum  RSS      The Henrickson family saga has come to a shocking end -- was the   Big Love  series finale everything you had hoped it would be? If you haven't yet watched the finale, step away from your computer, fire up that DVR and find out how it all ended... The Finale  Bill was arrested on charges of statutory rape and spent two nights in jail (all of which occurred off-camera). Bill and Barb continued to fight over her decision to join the reform church. When Barb told Bill she was going to be baptized in the church, Bill packed his stuff and brought it to Nicki's house. Margene expressed a desire to do good in the world by going on missions to help those in need. Barb helped Nicki find the good within herself. Nicki made amends with Cara Lynn. Bill used the last senate session to present a bill to legalize polygamy. Don informed Bill that they have lost the Home Plus stores. On Easter Sunday, Bill gave an impassioned sermon to a huge crowd of Mormon followers. Barb showed up during the sermon after abandoning her baptism to remain a part of her family. Not wanting to live through the awful affects of dementia, Frank gives Lois what she wants -- death via assisted suicide. Lois quietly passes away with Frank by her side. Angry that Bill replaced his ruined lawn with beautiful sod, Bill's neighbor (who had been heading towards a breakdown for months) fatally shoots him. As he is dying, Bill asks Barb to give him a blessing, signifying that he has finally accepted her as a priesthood holder. Bill dies a martyr. Eleven months after Bill's death, Margene is about to embark on her dream of doing mission work; Sarah now has a baby, newly baptized by Barb (who has taken Bill's place in the church); Ben and Heather got back together; Nicki finally seems to be in a happy place; all three wives have grown closer, and are moving on as strong, empowered women.  So, what did you think of the series finale of  Big Love ? Was it as bad as the   Medium finale ? Were you happy with the way it ended or gravely disappointed? I have to admit that although I felt the majority of this season and all of last season were not as good creatively as the first three years, the finale still managed to nicely wrap up most of those loose ends. While at times Barb and Margene displayed some moments of independence, for the most part these three women devoted their whole lives around Bill. It was nice to see them each blossom and grow in the wake of this death. Would they have still taken steps to improve their lives if he were still alive? Possibly, but I guess we'll never know. In the end, I realized that this series was more about the dynamic relationship between these three very different women and not so much about the relationship between a man and his three wives. Some of you may be disappointed, it may not have been the ending you had hoped for, but if you really step back and think about everything leading up to the very end, it was quite spiritual.

One of our favorite shows and it will be missed!   Leave a Comment   Leave a Comment  Name *   Email:  (never displayed)  *   URL  Your Comment *     Line and paragraph breaks are automatic.
