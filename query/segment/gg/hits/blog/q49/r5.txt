Big Love is the story of Bill Henrickson, a polygamist carrying three wives, three homes, two Home Improvement stores and seven children in Utah. Hiding his dark secret from the rest of the community in which he lives, life has become extremely complicated for Bill -- but it is certainly never dull. Premiered: March 12, 2006 When is it on?: During its regular season, which comes out at different times of the year,  Big Love airs on Sunday nights at 10pm EST on HBO. The series also airs on the various HBO channels (check your local listings). Starring: Bill Paxton as Bill Henrickson  Jeanne Tripplehorn as Barb Henrickson  Chloe Sevigny as Nicki Henrickson  Ginnifer Goodwin as Margene Henrickson   LDS Trivia : The Latter-Day Saints put a stop to polygamy in 1890. LDS Controversy: During season three, a scene in the latter half of the season involved Barb taking part in a special LDS ritual. The church was up in arms over the scene because they felt it was wrong to depict a ritual that only LDS members were privy to over the years.
