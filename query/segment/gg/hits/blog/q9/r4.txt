Madam, I am sending this note through a trusted bearer as I know that it will not reach you    Expand   The Scam Club India Ltd. By Revathi Seshadri. (Appeared as 'Middle' on The Hitavada dt.2-7-2011.)   Madam, I am sending this note through a trusted bearer as I know that it will not reach you otherwise. The jailers are inquisitive boors. More important, the society is a secret one with selective members. News of it should by no means reach the news hawks. I do not think I need to introduce myself. For months the media could not stop itself from talking about me or for that matter any of the members of our club. We hog the TV and print media space. I do not know what they will do without us. Uncommon play with Common man’s Wealth became my Waterloo. Actually, the club was mooted by one of the (once) highly revered police officers now under the custody of his own former department. While in Jail he scrupulously kept in touch with the newspapers and heaved a sigh of relief when I took over and he was pushed to the background. Musing all by himself within the four walls of his cell gave him the idea to form ‘The Club Notorious’. When a person retires into the jail premises after letting someone else take over the attention of the masses (for all wrong reasons) from himself/ herself, he/she becomes eligible for membership to the club.  Once the person  takes the oath of secrecy, the club's rules, bye-laws, the perks that are available to members etc will be made known to him/her.  Well, I obliged him for more than two months and became the most sought after news item. I was quite accommodative and brought into focus some of my deputies too. Ungrateful wretches, they cried foul and pointed to me as the chief perpetrator. Well, I got tired of it all, the non ending flash of the cameras was making me hot all over and it was actually a relief to retire-behind the bars and let someone else take over. It was highly flattering that my successor to media attention was no less than a ‘Broad Spectrum’ personality who is said to have caused loss to the government in lakhs of crores of rupees. I am told that there is a saying in your vernacular "The man who extracts honey naturally gets to lick his fingers." How much he got to lick is still being speculated on. The man surfaced behind the walls of the jail to become another honorary member of ‘The Club Notorious’, after letting you take the centre stage. The P.R. woman who comes and goes as the news media pleases, could not rise to your heights to hide the public gaze on you. You had to hog it for a far longer time than any of us and we of the club have been waiting patiently for you to join and add some glamour and colour to the otherwise jaded group and you did at last. Welcome to the club and to the jail. The corporate heavy weights with whom we have to share the media attention and jail space, got wind of the news and now they want to enroll too. But we decided to keep the membership exclusive. It would become too unwieldy otherwise. We have told them kindly but firmly- ‘No members of trade please’ as the British would put it. Now the rumour is that they are floating their own club. They are welcome to. I suppose you understand that you owe your membership to your cousin, the ex- favourite of your family. He saved you by taking the media glare off you on himself. Whatever the family ‘blow hot blow cold’ relations are, you may be thankful to him on this account. We are also spreading the red carpet for him here as he is expected to walk in anytime now. As I said before, madam, welcome till bail gets you off the jail- if ever! Your Co-member and well-wisher, Well, you know who.        Close    Leave a Comment     Flat  Nested     Comments (6)             Revathi Seshadri  posted 4 mnths ago Looks like that.
