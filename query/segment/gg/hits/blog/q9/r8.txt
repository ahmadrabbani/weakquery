Venues are super careful as the fines for them are huge. To put it in perspective for you though, in the past decade I have been working at schoolies, I have never heard someone say the best time they have had all week was when we were in x pub or y club and z happened. Clubs and pubs just don't fit into the picture. When you get there - ship loads of stuff will be going on, if you could get into a club legit it would be the last thing on your mind... it's only because you can't get in legit that your thinking about it.  twistedem 11-10-2004, 02:04 AM  hey dominic, i remember u posting the exact same post on bos :p  anyways dude, just get ur friends to bring u back some grog to the motel room, get maggot and go into town and then get into the action most ppl will b outside anyways, and byron doesnt have much of a clubbing scene anyways, only pubs, which are alright, and often they have gigs outside....the railway station (or called something similar) is a huge outdoor kinda thing with bands playing outside, and the beaches is the same so dont stress dude, youll have plenty of fun  Dominic 11-10-2004, 03:29 AM  I thought there was an eco in here!  disco_dave 21-10-2004, 10:39 PM  i was wondering if you can use other id's than your licence or proof of age?? i dont really wanna take my licence everywhere cause im sure ill lose it somewhere. if i do lose my licence what am i going to use for the rest of the week?? my school id looks similar to a licence, it has photo, hologram logo, magnetic strip, and sealed like a licence... is that useable???  Dominic 21-10-2004, 10:57 PM  No. DL or Passport for 18+ venues & bottle shops.  kyleallen 21-10-2004, 11:03 PM  what about 18+ cards?  Dominic 21-10-2004, 11:05 PM  Sorry, 18+ cards are fine too.  disco_dave 21-10-2004, 11:13 PM  so if i lose my licence i cant keep going out??? that really sucks cause im quite prone to doing that!!  surfa_Sair 21-10-2004, 11:27 PM  hey disco dave... maybe you should go to the rta and say you lost your id.. and get another one so you got 2 i ALWAYS lose mine coz i dont take a bag haha.. it suks coz you wont be able to go out!! just be EXTRA careful..  Also dominic when i went up i loved the beach and the street but i also LOVED the clubs.. where i met a bit older crowd and also had the best time..  disco_dave 22-10-2004, 12:08 AM  argh thats such a waste of money when i could use stupid school one i am never going to use again!! im hopeless with them, i dont normally take my wallet with me either. might make some zip pockets on my jeans and shorts.  i have some friends that dont have a licence and proof of age thinking they will get in with out school id (cause it is so quality). ill have to let em no!  surfa_Sair 22-10-2004, 01:22 PM  School ID is nothing to the bouncers up there.. mine was real and i had it bended scraped and everything...  its only like 20buks-30buks to get another one if you lose it which isnt that much if you think about it.  They dont let anyone in without id.. i saw 40yr olds getting checked just coz its "policy"  disco_dave 22-10-2004, 07:17 PM  argh that sucks. but ill have to do it.. more licences for me!!! wonder why the dont except them if there that good??  Dancinbabe 17-11-2004, 11:56 PM  I always loose things... thats just meh for ya... I would usually put them in mah boys wallet that way if I wear a skirt or somthing without pockets its sweet sailin but why else do guys where baggy clothes... unless they are boardies... and boardies don't always necarsarily hav pockets... hmm somthin to think about! Might need to use the landyard and put my card in there... unless someone will try and snatch it off meh... rah I could go on forever bout the possibilites :eek:  Catch 20-11-2004, 03:51 PM  hey ppl, ummm im going on schoolies to byron bay nov27-dec4, and im only gonna be 17 and 9 mths by then... so basically i need a fake id > do any of u know of any internet sites (ive checked most of them out and they are bull****) or any ways to make a fake id. some of my mates suggested scratching but apparently the bouncers can check for that by bending the license?? neways, get back to me with ur thoughts Hey, I don't know what it's like in Sydney but it sounds stricter than here in queensland. There are heaps of really easy, fool proof ways to get fakies here but you've gotta know the right people. I don't wanna go into much detail here for privacy reasons but if you're serious about this, email me and i'll try and hook you up with some people. There's a small fee but it's worth it. You'd have to come to brisbane first to get it done tho.  Danieru_X 20-11-2004, 08:12 PM  Meh id reather not use fake ids, serious fines and BS, but hey when ya thing about it u only got 17 years to enjoy being underage and to be naughty, waiting one or 2 years wont kill ya u got another 50+ years to be legal. Enjoi being young while we still are and let the good times roll, skoolies 2004 here i cum!  Baker 20-11-2004, 08:29 PM  Meh id reather not use fake ids, serious fines and BS, but hey when ya thing about it u only got 17 years to enjoy being underage and to be naughty, waiting one or 2 years wont kill ya u got another 50+ years to be legal. Enjoi being young while we still are and let the good times roll, skoolies 2004 here i cum!  :iconcur: very valid points!...  Catch 21-11-2004, 01:03 AM  Meh id reather not use fake ids, serious fines and BS, but hey when ya thing about it u only got 17 years to enjoy being underage and to be naughty, waiting one or 2 years wont kill ya u got another 50+ years to be legal. Enjoi being young while we still are and let the good times roll, skoolies 2004 here i cum! That's true, and it's cool to have your own opinion but, Fakies do exactly that to enjoy being underage and being naughty. Clubbing when you're underage is so much more fun then when you're legal just cos you're bein bad ;) When you're older, the fun of clubbing wears off very quickly for a lot of people. It's like any rule - household or school. If something's forbidden, it just makes it more enticing. So basically what im trying to say is that fakies are completely in sinq with letting the good times roll, and making the most out of our youth.  ...........Skoolies 2004 CLUBS, Here I come! weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :eek:  Aza17 21-11-2004, 01:26 AM  Catch actually it is not east to create fake id's, just like the american notes which look just like paper, there are many hidden functions throughout. like flouroescent dyes etc....... Also did u not just watch the news tonight and see the fake id's haul on the news. Also this site is probably patrolled by police(federal) so why talk about this here, it is pretty silly. as if it is worth it with fake id's. Dont do it.  Catch 21-11-2004, 01:43 AM  ...Actually it IS easy, IF you know what you're doing. That's why I said I didnt want to go into details. There aren't many people who know how to get the job done properly. But this system is foolproof. I've organised a lot of stuff for previous skoolies and no one's ever been caught including myself. Also, you are jumping to conclusions when you assume you know how we make the licences. We don't make forgeries, they're completely legit.  smeagols_ghost 21-11-2004, 08:22 AM  They would probly do you under new anti-terror laws if you were making decent fougrys. OR Catch is the cops :cool:  The only way i can think of to make "legit" id's now thev'e tightend the id requirements (well they have up here, you cant just walk in and get anyones birth certifuite like you used to) is to have some one in the transport department get you the paper. From there its a quick ocr and paste job.  Catch 22-11-2004, 04:18 PM  haha, someone's smart. You're close there.  But you got me. I'm a 16 yr old, drug dealing cop organising fake IDs for schoolies.... watch out :whip:  Aza17 22-11-2004, 04:30 PM  Youd better watch out, catch why should you get involved on that, and especially admitting to it on the internet, the net aint safe.  dont get yourself into trouble its not worth it. How do you know no one here is an under cover officer.  Catch 22-11-2004, 04:41 PM  There undoubtedly is, but that's why I havent really given any personal details out. And I'm sure im not about to be targeted, taking into account the rest of the fish out there on the internet.  Aza17 22-11-2004, 05:49 PM  with that naive behaviour catch you will get caught, it is just like saying there are thousands of people who speed on the roads, so why would i get caught if i did it. You dont need to tell people your details they can be found out. how do you think drug busts happen, ok sometimes there is a tip off but not always. your vulnerable on the net, you can be hacked and tracked down, the technology is there.  Catch 22-11-2004, 06:32 PM  Maybe I will get caught, maybe I won't. There's no need to mother me tho. And if you're really that worried about me, you certainly shouldnt be drawing so much attention to it. Personally, I think although the net is a good information base for the government, forums would be considered far from evidentiary. After all, my name's not actually "Catch", how can anyone say my words are anymore truthful?  Punkrock_Scotty 02-06-2005, 06:34 PM  anyone know how to make fake ids? and if so, do u rekn they would work in bottle shops, coz i wont be goin clubbing n stuff, too risky. im not giving some random guy my money to go on a grog run, and none of my friends, nor myself, will be 18. if anyone can help me id greatly appreciate it.  ssurfy 02-06-2005, 07:55 PM  Just fill your suitcase with grog before schoolies, that way you can have some one you know get it for ya... be preparedd!! Even take an extra suitcase or two full of grog each. :D  Dominic 02-06-2005, 08:18 PM  If anyone was wondering... of all threads in this forum, this is the one where something you post has a very very high chance of getting you banned from the forums. Not saying there is anything wrong yet... but think before you post. This goes for PMs and emails via the forum on this topic also. FYI, tons of people were done for fakies last year, n the year before. Anyone posting about how easy it is has never done one properly before and is talking out of their ass, or is making something that will be easily caught out at gold coast schoolies. With over ten years working on the streets and many years visiting people in prisons... trust me when it comes to how dodgy stuff that can get you locked up does and doesn't work. If you don't have legit id, don't buy grog at the gold coast or try and get into a club or pub unless you want a fine. You can't even walk in the door of most bottle shops during schoolies without showing ID, then, they check it again inside and there are always police within spitting distance of the bottlo's also carding people on the way out sometimes or doing bag checks. It's fully over the top psycho tight at the goldie.  Punkrock_Scotty 02-06-2005, 08:19 PM  hehe that seems like a good idea actually...im goin by plane tho :( 2 of my friends r driving, and i can buy the grog from the bottloes down here in ermington...bunch of junkies run the store lol...but i rekn i should have an id just in case...they dont accept school id cards do they? coz ive done a pretty darn good job of scratching off the '8' off the end of the '1988'...all i need is the right pen to put a '7' in there.  Punkrock_Scotty 02-06-2005, 08:22 PM  btw thx for the heads up dom...i wont post much more on the topic... im goin to coffs, u rekn they will be as tight as the gold coast?  Dominic 02-06-2005, 11:13 PM  Scratch off the 8, write a 7 with the right pen. Use it. I think thats a great idea and doubt you will get busted, even if you went to schoolies at an army base, they would never pick it. Scotty... are you seriously that stupid?  Sammy Wammy 03-06-2005, 12:20 AM  Perhaps he was joking? :confused:  ssurfy 03-06-2005, 12:24 AM  I think thats a great idea and doubt you will get busted, even if you went to schoolies at an army base  lmao... he'd be the new James Bond:facesjump  Punkrock_Scotty 03-06-2005, 12:25 AM  lol no im not that stupid dom dw. i have made a pretty convincing one that works at the bottle shops in my area, but im not gonna try it at schoolies...no chance.  ssurfy 03-06-2005, 12:42 AM  haha u can walk up with a piece of paper with your name on it and pass for a fake id with half the bottle shops around... schoolies is like 100000 times stricter lol :p  JohnTee 03-06-2005, 01:07 AM  Clubs/Disco over here have a age limit of 18, some 21. This is what some underage kids do, serious and it's not a joke. They will report that their IC is stolen or lost or whatever, and they will make a false report with false age and DOB. I dont know why the police dont double check. These kids will use the report as a valid IC.  Catch 03-06-2005, 07:20 PM  Sorry if I caused a bit of a stir then Dom. I wasn't really giving advice or implying anything personal, just more giving people the facts. For those of you yet to rub two braincells together: i was really NOT serious about organising ids for schoolies. Sarcasm being the key word here. Even if i were, i sure as hell wouldn't be providing for people in melbourne and sydney who have no idea what they're doing and arent even coming near goldy.  *would really appreciate a cease to pms on this topic. peace kids :toilet:  stevo_rabs 10-06-2005, 12:55 AM  If a pub doesn't ask for ID, then neither do I ;)  charky23 15-10-2005, 01:40 PM  SO to clarify. are proof of age cards (such as a keypass) a valid for of Id in Byron?  Cause i still havent got my DL! and i dont want to be lugging my passport everywhere.  Baker 15-10-2005, 04:47 PM  proof of age is valid yes, as said in other post :D  commando_penguin 17-10-2005, 09:18 PM  Scratch off the 8, write a 7 with the right pen. Use it. I think thats a great idea and doubt you will get busted, even if you went to schoolies at an army base, they would never pick it. Scotty... are you seriously that stupid? mite work if u scratch off the 8 and make it look like a 6 :facesjump  Woody 17-10-2005, 09:33 PM  Or you could just try and cover up the date with your finger/thumb when you flash it at them, hoping that they dont ask to hold it themselves!:p  commando_penguin 17-10-2005, 09:56 PM  Or you could just try and cover up the date with your finger/thumb when you flash it at them, hoping that they dont ask to hold it themselves!:p these ideas r all stupid. go with the 1 that is garanteed 2 work; take 1 of those watch-on-a-string things (shut up) and take it in with u, wen u get asked 4 id just hypnotise him and get him 2 giv u everything free of charge and dance around like a tissue box in heat  Lela 17-10-2005, 10:27 PM  paid $30 for fake international I.D. and a friend tested it, its worked so far just to be doubly sure, i have a friends licence with the same details as previous i.d. only way to go, if your going to go wiht a fake id  Woody 17-10-2005, 10:39 PM  /me is 18 the DAY we get back from schoolies /me is hoping that the guys at the Lorne pub will be leanient enough.  ssurfy 17-10-2005, 10:56 PM  paid $30 for fake international I.D. and a friend tested it, its worked so far just to be doubly sure, i have a friends licence with the same details as previous i.d. only way to go, if your going to go wiht a fake id  is it a hard plastic card or a laminated one??  Lela 18-10-2005, 07:35 PM  hard plastic pretty impressive too  jambocool 18-10-2005, 09:30 PM  hard plastic pretty impressive too so has it been good enough around the clubs and pubs etc lela? also are more city or country? wonder how the sydney city bouncers would take to them? also did you get my PM?  Lela 18-10-2005, 09:54 PM  i haven't used it yet but a mate got into a bar in the city (melbourne) though i know some places only take licences, nothing else, so im relying on friends licence there and i did get PM jamie, just ask around, the internet is just that little bit seedy. would hate to get caught...  jambocool 18-10-2005, 10:31 PM  yeah so true.. oh well looks ill just get that, and hope i can get in one or two places while im up there lol, dont know anyone thats 18 and looks anything like me lol  Lela 18-10-2005, 10:34 PM  im never going to make my kid a young-un no matter how smart!  jambocool 18-10-2005, 11:12 PM  lol yeah would make it soo much easier for them for schoolies, thats if they still have it by then lol  naomi1234 19-10-2005, 07:06 AM  hey ppl, ummm im going on schoolies to byron bay nov27-dec4, and im only gonna be 17 and 9 mths by then... so basically i need a fake id > do any of u know of any internet sites (ive checked most of them out and they are bull****) or any ways to make a fake id. some of my mates suggested scratching but apparently the bouncers can check for that by bending the license?? neways, get back to me with ur thoughts Hey there, My friends and I are going to schoolies in the 2nd week (party week) in surfers and one of my friends wont be 18....we've tried making fake IDs and the whole shebang, but they didnt work at all aye.....So basically weve just gotten another ID off a girl whose not going to schoolies who looks almost exactly like my friend.....Ur probably better off doing that, finding sum1 who kinda looks like u and whose not going to schoolies and borrowing their ID..... :) Good luck and have fun!!  Lela 20-10-2005, 06:33 PM  pub or bar...fake id, such as corny international student stuff has a higher chance of working. nightclubs...key pass or licence only (usually), some bouncers will scrutinise it very carefully and will reject those who dont look like the pic, even if it is you getting the pass out stamp always works well though, just dont smudge it too much. the busier the place the better, as they wont think twice if they dont remember your face ps. jay, he'd be better off paying someone who looks like him to take out another licence. the international i.d. is good as back up to prove you have another form of photo id. by itslef its a bit dodge  Jolly Roger 21-10-2005, 12:43 AM  Guys I've been reading through your replies and I can tell all of you who are planning on making fake ID's or buying them, or just using a mates are absolutely stupid. Seriously I'm not saying that it won't ever work (not that you'll have much of a chance at schoolies), I'm just saying that it is not worth the risk. If you want some grog that is fair enough, hey its schoolies, just get one of your mates to buy it for you, or ask a random, it's alot easier than making a FID and paying the huge fines when you get caught. Trust me its not cool when they call the cops on you and your standing there knowing that your schoolies celebration is over. How do I know, cause I have already been caught before, and my ID was real. I actually got mine from the department of transport with my mates birth cert., bank card, fake school ID and phone bill. I said I lost my license and needed a new one. I knew his pevious fines, his parents birth places, everythng. The good thing was that they don't keep photos on file (in Queensland they use polaroids) so they got know way of knowing what they should look like. Anyway I got my ID and of course hit the bars every night for bout a week until scoolies came round when one of the coppers asked me to show him my ID when I bought a heap of grog from a bottlo. I showed him not really giving a sht, how was he to know it wasn't mine. Well he took me straight away to the cop shop there where it turned out that the same cop had pulled my mate up (my ID mate) a few hours ago for drink driving. Anyway you should be able to tell what happened from there... I should also mention that this this story was STRICTLY aimed to help you all realise that if you use a FID, "your gunna have a bad time"...... :iconcur:  Luke 21-10-2005, 12:52 AM  Despite from the fact what happened to you was pure bad luck, you do have a point. But, in saying this, what's life worth if you don't take a few risks? Go for it I say...

Such a hassle! So much better bein 18 eh. stress free clubbin and pubbin  hanimii 21-10-2005, 07:11 PM  i reckon the only thing they can pick u up on is how at the top it says duplicate.... and i mean if ur friend is stupid enough to drink drive then of course theres a high risk in getting caught... my friend did it with her sisters, then went clubbing with her sister and got caught bahaha cause they had the same details bahaha  jambocool 21-10-2005, 07:48 PM  well ive ordered the international ID :D so now just gotta wait for it to come.. its just a pity cos i dont know anyone that looks like me, cos id copy their ID for sure.. :/  Andyy 21-10-2005, 08:02 PM  to the people born in 88 with their license,  im not sure if u can do this in other states, but a couple people i know made they 88 into an 86 Mine looks crappy, but on the actual card its VERY small and u cant tell. U scratch with a pin/needle, draw in the extra dot very finely then to get rid of the scratch marks, re laminate it :)  Catch 22-10-2005, 12:17 PM  Man... that looks like sh.it. And wouldn't relaminating it make it look extra thick? But hey, I've never seen it done well before so maybe i'm wrong. One thing I have seen a lot of people do really successfully, although it doesn't really matter anymore cos all these people will be 18 by now - but loads of people born in '86, when they went for their licence, and they wrote in the year 1986 they'd do it kind of messily so it looked like 1980. totally foolproof.... I also know one chick that when she got her licence at 16, she wasn't even trying to trick the system, they just screwed it up and it said she was born in 1978, and she was from '86. F.uckin score I reckon. :headbang:  Jolly Roger 22-10-2005, 04:01 PM  ..... that is such a ridiculous argument its not even worth explaining how irrelevant all your points were.

Firstly, I can't see how anyone could describe what you said as "simply showing us an alternate way of getting a FID", since you started by calling everyone who's written in this thread as absolutely stupid. You went on to try and discourage us from making the effort of getting a fake id... now you claim you have nothing against FIDs?...right. And by that, what exactly is this "alternative way" you speak of? being a dumbc.unt and gettin done by the pigs?? getting some random to buy us drinks? or getting a copy of a friends licence with a different pic? - Which of course NO ONE has ever thought of. THANKYOU!! captain obvious. :cool:  Btw, I'm completely devastated being called an ignorant tool by you.... I just don't know how I can go on, now that I know of the complete ignorance i've lived my entire life in... maybe I should just slit my wrists :rotfl:  Punkrock_Scotty 22-10-2005, 06:48 PM  .... wanna contradict yourself anymore???

Your correct details will be taken and you will either be fined on the spot or summoned to appear in court. The penalties Found on licensed premises $1875 Or an on the spot fine of $225 In possession of or consuming liquor on licensed premises $1875 Or an on the spot fine of $225 Falsely representing self to be over 18 $1875 Or an on the spot fine of $225 Producing another person's ID as your own $1875 Or an on the spot fine of $225 Producing a false ID $1875 Or an on the spot fine of $225 Allowing another person to use your ID $3000 Or an on the spot fine of $375 Defacing an ID $3000 Or an on the spot fine of $300 Making a false ID $3000 Or an on the spot fine of $450 Supply liquor to a minor $3000 Or an on the spot fine of $600 http://www.health.qld.gov.au/schoolies/images/logos/QPS_Badge.jpg (http://www.police.qld.gov.au/) Police can issue on the spot fines for: Drinking in a public place ($75) Selling liquor to a minor ($600) Supplying liquor to a minor ($600) Sometimes, things that don�t seem to be a big deal can have serious consequences.

Dominic 22-10-2005, 07:29 PM  BTW at 2003 Schoolies they took $70,000 in fines at Surfers Paradise alone which was widely considered as pretty low.

Dominic 18-11-2005, 05:04 PM  Reminder for anyone who is trying their luck with a fakie... I strongly encourage you to find another way!

Im the youngest of all my friends going as most of them have turned 18 or are this week, I'm only 17 and turn 18 in January. I have a friends ID that looks like me but it says I'm 20, it works everywhere in sydney, just worried about the age at schoolies...does anyone have advice for what i should do? I'm really dressed about this because I really want to have a good time and get involved in all the activities and not be left out of what my friends are doing!...HELP ME PPPPPLLLLLEEEEAAAASSSSEEEE!!! :banghead:  Sammy Wammy 23-11-2005, 04:10 PM  I have some advice.. stop posting the same thing everywhere! we can read it, and people who can help, will.. theres no need to post it everywhere.. everyone is reading it, dont worry.. they're trying to help you, k?  Luke 23-11-2005, 04:27 PM  The question is, are you willing to risk being fined etc? What I would do for the first few days is ask your friends if you can do some underage activities and then the next few days I would attempt at getting into clubs/pubs etc with your friends ID. That way if you get busted and they send you packing you would of atleast got to experience some of schoolies. Remember, you're a girl and bouncers tend to be fairly lenient with females.  broady 05-12-2005, 09:46 PM  What kind of checks do cops typically run on IDs? i.e. looking at the photo checking if it is fake looking you up on database Curious.  boxc 10-05-2006, 11:43 PM  hey, scratching works a treat if you do it right!  your next best chance is to just get someone elses, if you get caught with a scratched one you cant exactly just run away cos they got ya details sittin in thier hand and then ya up on fraud.  Shifty 13-05-2006, 04:25 PM  I'm sort of in the same boat. I turn 18 like a week before schoolies. And thats a packed week, so I will only have my L's. Which was taken when I was 16 and I look WAY different. People dont even accept if for ID as my self now..... What kind of card can I get that they will accept when Im 17? And I dont want to have to go get a renewed L's card... As for the scratching. If looks crap. Thats it. Nothing else. My mates did it. The number on the back of the card are just to different for starters. And people pick up on that straight away. But the borrowing card works some times. My mate has a older brother who looks EXACTLY like him (sept hes taller. They both even are startgin to bald...) And he gets away with that.  I tried to get into a nightclub without a ID... Saying i had my wallet stoled, worked.... Story I went to a pub round the cornor and had a mate (over 18) and he went in and I said my mate had my wallet and just walked in (Fluke)  Then came out and talked to the bouncers later so they would rememeber me, but forgotten that I havent shown ID. Told them my (fake)name and birth in general convosation.  Then I went to the bar and reported my wallet stolen and gave them my (fake)name and birth Then went back to the club and and said I had my wallet stolen at the pub, they radioed the bouncer at the pub and he said I was O.K, and let me in..... Pure Goodluck and Genius Thinking... I have no idea how it worked, but it did....  boxc 14-05-2006, 09:29 PM  hey, wel depends where you come from i gues, victorian l's cards cost 17.70 to get a new one, u simply tell them that u lost it and then they look at ya photo on thier data base and if it dosent look like you they take another photo and it takes about 20 min to do, but im not too sure what its like in other states. as for the numbers on the back i have seen a number of scratched victorian ones and they look perfect! u could also have a look at the Keypass id's that you apply for at the police stations, they are accepted at all night clubs, oor you could just get a proof of age card. thats probably ur best bet, but they cost about 50$ as far as i know.  theres alot of options, justy look around, getin a new l's is probably ya best option.  Jackle 14-05-2006, 09:40 PM  as for the numbers on the back i have seen a number of scratched victorian ones and they look perfect! A guy staying at my hotel at schoolies tried that, it was flawless, or so i thought. BIIIIIIIIIIG fine copped he did.  suga69 25-05-2006, 10:29 PM  if ur 18 just a week before schoolies, try a proof of age card, they're only 20 in WA and yeah, u should be able to get it just before u go to schoolies if u beg them and tell them its super high priority and important  androxy 30-05-2006, 11:59 PM  If you want a fakie in QLD, get a mates birth certificate, bank card, letter with his address on it, and medicare card.

I can vouch for what dominic is saying. I recently left my wallet on top of the car and drove off. naturally when i realised it was already goneskies. Depending on which club you go to in the city or valley, they will either say mate this is a duplicate u got more ID, only some places dont care. I can say that family nightclub in the valley (brisbane) does not care. to me this seems very shady as rules are different.  Now that im 18 (about 11mnths now) im looking for ways to get into clubs for free. Some clubs use UV stamps, which can only be seen under UV black lights. Once you go there once you can see what the UV stamp shape is, so im buying a UV pen, to draw on myself b4 i go there :) and also other clubs just use coloured stamps, diff colours for diff nights, once u know the pattern (which only takes a few times of going and paying) u can find out what coloursthey use when, and then just make ur own stamp with coloured ink.  androxy 15-06-2006, 11:45 PM  But if u take your mates bank card along as well, PLUS what if your mate is not goin to schoolies. How will they say yeah its a duplicate.???  Aza17 16-06-2006, 04:54 PM  I dont know what the big deal is... how bout you just wait till you can legally go to a club. Theres heaps of other things on at schoolies anyway. if u wanna hook up with girls its just as easy to walk along the beach or cavill avenue ANY time of the day or night and try your chances at chatting them up.  androxy 19-06-2006, 06:15 PM  Its no biggy for me i got a fakie, but it makes it alot easier to buy alcohol believe it or not.

We are from nsw and my friend didnt hav her drivers license just a proof of age and that worked..  Luke 24-06-2006, 05:00 PM  Yep, any RTA approved licences work.  mel29 25-06-2006, 10:10 PM  thanks heaps guys, a CAV and keypass are VIC Ids so yeah ill see how i go ill take my licence n keypass with me :)  the_real_genius 27-06-2006, 05:30 PM  If you really need a fake ID for skoolies the best way is finding someone that looks like you. HOWEVER... Often this is hard to find so i have found numereous other methods which are all succesfull anmd have been done. 1. Adjusting you L's- there is two ways of doin this. One you use nail polish remover and remove the month and year at the back of the card and also remove just the date on the front of the card. You then print the exact font of the card on contact paper in your printer for both the back and front of your L's. Both forms of font can be found simple on microsoft word. The other method in which i recommend is nail polishing the 1988 into a 1983 on ther back. You then do the same for the front using a cotton bud with nail polish remover. The secret to this method is preparation. You must tape the back and front to avoid removing other areas and making simple mistakes. In this method it is vital you purchase one of those spungers that have both a yellow and green side. You use the rough side to smooth in the removed square on the back makin it impossible to tell it's fake. 2. Faking yuour identity- This is the best method yet the most risky. However three of my mates have been sucessful in doin this. It involves purchasing either your brothers or sisters or friends deatails such as there birth certificate, bank details and other forms of proof. You then walk into vicroads with prefable your brother or sister and say u lost ur L's and your bro/ sis say she lost her P's. You then wait and go to the next counter. They look on the database and realise this is actually u and ur bro and give u a receite. You then asked to have both brand new photos. Then you simple swap receites as you go to get ur photo so u have ur bros ID with ur photo on it. Enjoy!  Dominic 27-06-2006, 07:58 PM  I moved this thread into members only as it is drawing in a lot of traffic for the phrase [fake id] from people who aren't celebrating schoolies or even from Australia in many cases.  yogy 01-07-2006, 02:38 PM  hey all, new to this n would love your help was just wondering if keypasses and CAV Id cards are accepted at clubs n pubs up there, ive heard its only passports n drivers licences? Passports, Drivers LIcence, Keypass's are suitable ID but NO birth certificate would be accepted. They have only limited sources of identification that can be accepted. This about tells you what you will need. it is the same Australia wide. So go into your local pub and check out the posters they have of ID that they will accept. It will be the same there.  Aza17 01-07-2006, 03:50 PM  ID depending on venue can range from a QLD proof of age card, drivers license to full frontal nudity  Keeron_Man_boy 11-08-2006, 08:09 PM  hey guyz, im heading up 2 lorne 4 skoolies but i am still goin 2 be 17 i have an id that kind of looks like me but does any one no if they are stricked in lorne on id's or dont they care much...i mean for goin 2 the pub and such peepz91 i was 17 when i went up to byron bay for schoolies.. i tried using my learners haha but got knocked back :P on the last night in byron, a bloke that was stayin with us shows me is old learners and said use that :eek: i got in ok everywhere.. so i cant imagine u will knocked back :facesjump  Keeron_Man_boy 13-08-2006, 01:57 AM  bouncers and barmen will only accept all australian drivers license and all australia keypass's although my brother has a keypass and sometime bouncers in SA wont accept it and he gets knocked back... try and grab an original copy of your birth certificate and a photo id of any kind (like a student card) will also work  Cait 18-08-2006, 07:39 PM  My sister suggested using her old DL and old bank card to use for leavers and we are only 18mnths apart and look really similar, would i be able to get away with using it do you reacon??

Like who takes there birth certificate down to leavers??? lol  Keeron_Man_boy 18-08-2006, 08:17 PM  alot of people take BC out to clubs and sh!t in the city... i dont think its suss... show em the id and if they reject it then pull out the BC from ur purse or whatever lol  Sammy Wammy 18-08-2006, 09:06 PM  just tell em you've come all that way so youd rather be safe then sorry;  gnome 19-08-2006, 02:44 AM  yeh a lot of people come with extra id its not that weird  Cait 19-08-2006, 04:29 PM  lol ok thanks xOxOx  gilez 05-09-2006, 09:02 PM  2.

I almost made the mistake of using my mates stuff so i could get a 18+ card but it says he was born in india and **** so itd be a little sus that i look far from indian  darkt3ch 30-10-2006, 01:39 PM  lol, I have used fakeID's since I was like mid 16 (18 now) and only got knocked back once and that was on schoolies at a bottlo THE DAY BEFORE I TURNED 18. haaha.. I went back there the next day n same guy was working had a good chat with him told him he was the only person to pick up on it in years. but other than that for the first 3 days of schoolies I went to atleast 15 clubs and didnt get a knockdown. lol I even went out with 2 mates that were 18 and both of them got knocked back and I was allowed in cuz apperently they were too drunk yet I was more smashed then both of em. I even fell down the stairs when we walked away haa... its all about looking decent and how ya talk to the bouncer. CONFIDENCE gets you in not a good ID. anyway. there is a few ways.

Dominic 22-11-2008, 06:55 AM  I moved this thread into members only as it is drawing in a lot of traffic for the phrase [fake id] from people who aren't celebrating schoolies or even from Australia in many cases. I've moved this thread out of the members only section as the extra traffic is no longer a problem.  sweet 30-05-2009, 03:19 AM  i'm going second week of schoolies and im going to still be 17 is there going to be anything to do? or am i wasting my time?  benLoL 23-10-2009, 12:03 AM  Don;t worry bout fake I.D man most of the **** happens outside of the clubs on beach etc. from what ive heard.  Black Ice 20-05-2010, 12:30 AM  Wouldn't mind one yet reckon the risks might be a tad high.. might take the safe option and not get one, yet I heard some people who did and never had any problems.  Gabi 09-08-2011, 10:16 PM  im somewhat interested in aquiring id.. ill be 17 for schoolies :/ but while im sure that would be alright i'm half keen to have had a fakey and gone out underage,,,just for the experience of it.. anyway anyone with info, post back? :)  Kristy_D 07-10-2011, 01:37 AM  What kind of checks do cops typically run on IDs? i.e. looking at the photo checking if it is fake looking you up on database Curious. No one's answered! How thoroughly do the bouncers check the photo on the ID? I have a friend's unhole-punched learners who looks like me quite a bit.. It's just that she's a week from 20 at Schoolies time.. Suss? Are Gold Coast bouncers lenient on girls like they are in Melbourne? :)  chris93 21-10-2011, 06:37 PM  If i get caught using someone elses ID am i likely to get fined or will i just be denied entry?  Dominic 21-10-2011, 07:02 PM  If i get caught using someone elses ID am i likely to get fined or will i just be denied entry? definitely fined. ''It�s not just a case of taking the false ID from the person trying to get in,'' he said. ''The police will attend and a prosecution will commence.'' Supt Keogh said it was important that schoolies understood the ramifications of trying to get into a licensed venue with a fake ID, including a $300 on-the-spot fine. ''Security providers with all the licensed venues are very much on their game in trying to identify kids coming in with false IDs,'' he said.
