Venues are super careful as the fines for them are huge.<br />
<br />
To put it in perspective for you though, in the past decade I have been working at schoolies, I have never heard someone say the best time they have had all week was when we were in x pub or y club and z happened. Clubs and pubs just don't fit into the picture.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
When you get there - ship loads of stuff will be going on, if you could get into a club legit it would be the last thing on your mind... it's only because you can't get in legit that your thinking about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
anyways dude, just get ur friends to bring u back some grog to the motel room, get maggot and go into town and then get into the action<br />
most ppl will b outside anyways, and byron doesnt have much of a clubbing scene anyways, only pubs, which are alright, and often they have gigs outside....the railway station (or called something similar) is a huge outdoor kinda thing with bands playing outside, and the beaches is the same<br />
so dont stress dude, youll have plenty of fun</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
its only like 20buks-30buks to get another one if you lose it which isnt that much if you think about it. <br />
<br />
They dont let anyone in without id.. i saw 40yr olds getting checked just coz its &quot;policy&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disco_dave</div><div class="date">22-10-2004, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">argh that sucks. but ill have to do it.. more licences for me!!!<br />

<br />
Hey, I don't know what it's like in Sydney but it sounds stricter than here in queensland. There are heaps of really easy, fool proof ways to get fakies here but you've gotta know the right people. I don't wanna go into much detail here for privacy reasons but if you're serious about this, email me and i'll try and hook you up with some people. There's a small fee but it's worth it.<br />
You'd have to come to brisbane first to get it done tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's true, and it's cool to have your own opinion but, Fakies do exactly that to enjoy being underage and being naughty. Clubbing when you're underage is so much more fun then when you're legal just cos you're bein bad  ;) When you're older, the fun of clubbing wears off very quickly for a lot of people. It's like any rule - household or school. If something's forbidden, it just makes it more enticing.<br />
<br />
So basically what im trying to say is that fakies are completely in sinq with letting the good times roll, and making the most out of our youth. <br />
<br />
...........Skoolies 2004 CLUBS, Here I come! weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aza17</div><div class="date">21-11-2004, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Catch actually it is not east to create fake id's, just like the american notes which look just like paper, there are many hidden functions throughout. like flouroescent dyes etc.......<br />
<br />
Also did u not just watch the news tonight and see the fake id's haul on the news.<br />
<br />
Also this site is probably patrolled by police(federal) so why talk about this here, it is pretty silly. as if it is worth it with fake id's.<br />
<br />
Dont do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catch</div><div class="date">21-11-2004, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...Actually it IS easy, IF you know what you're doing. That's why I said I didnt want to go into details. There aren't many people who know how to get the job done properly. But this system is foolproof. I've organised a lot of stuff for previous skoolies and no one's ever been caught including myself. Also, you are jumping to conclusions when you assume you know how we make the licences. We don't make forgeries, they're completely legit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smeagols_ghost</div><div class="date">21-11-2004, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They would probly do you under new anti-terror laws if you were making decent fougrys.   OR Catch is the cops :cool: <br />
<br />
The only way i can think of to make &quot;legit&quot; id's now thev'e tightend the id requirements (well they have up here, you cant just walk in and get anyones birth certifuite like you used to) is to have some one in the transport department get you the paper. From there its a quick ocr and paste job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You dont need to tell people your details they can be found out. how do you think drug busts happen, ok sometimes there is a tip off but not always. your vulnerable on the net, you can be hacked and tracked down, the technology is there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catch</div><div class="date">22-11-2004, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I will get caught, maybe I won't. There's no need to mother me tho. And if you're really that worried about me, you certainly shouldnt be drawing so much attention to it. Personally, I think although the net is a good information base for the government, forums would be considered far from evidentiary. After all, my name's not actually &quot;Catch&quot;, how can anyone say my words are anymore truthful?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Punkrock_Scotty</div><div class="date">02-06-2005, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">anyone know how to make fake ids? and if so, do u rekn they would work in bottle shops, coz i wont be goin clubbing n stuff, too risky.<br />
im not giving some random guy my money to go on a grog run, and none of my friends, nor myself, will be 18.<br />
<br />
if anyone can help me id greatly appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

Even take an extra suitcase or two full of grog each. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dominic</div><div class="date">02-06-2005, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If anyone was wondering... of all threads in this forum, this is the one where something you post has a very very high chance of getting you banned from the forums. Not saying there is anything wrong yet... but think before you post.<br />
<br />
This goes for PMs and emails via the forum on this topic also.<br />
<br />
FYI, tons of people were done for fakies last year, n the year before. Anyone posting about how easy it is has never done one properly before and is talking out of their ass, or is making something that will be easily caught out at gold coast schoolies.<br />
<br />
With over ten years working on the streets and many years visiting people in prisons... trust me when it comes to how dodgy stuff that can get you locked up does and doesn't work.<br />
<br />
If you don't have legit id, don't buy grog at the gold coast or try and get into a club or pub unless you want a fine. You can't even walk in the door of most bottle shops during schoolies without showing ID, then, they check it again inside and there are always police within spitting distance of the bottlo's also carding people on the way out sometimes or doing bag checks. It's fully over the top psycho tight at the goldie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Punkrock_Scotty</div><div class="date">02-06-2005, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe that seems like a good idea actually...im goin by plane tho :(<br />
<br />
2 of my friends r driving, and i can buy the grog from the bottloes down here in ermington...bunch of junkies run the store lol...but i rekn i should have an id just in case...they dont accept school id cards do they? coz ive done a pretty darn good job of scratching off the '8' off the end of the '1988'...all i need is the right pen to put a '7' in there.</div></div><hr />

This is what some underage kids do, serious and it's not a joke.<br />

<br />
so basically i need a fake id &gt; do any of u know of any internet sites (ive checked most of them out and they are bull****) or any ways to make a fake id.<br />
<br />
some of my mates suggested scratching but apparently the bouncers can check for that by bending the license??<br />
<br />
neways, get back to me with ur thoughts<br />
<br />
Hey there, My friends and I are going to schoolies in the 2nd week (party week) in surfers and one of my friends wont be 18....we've tried making fake IDs and the whole shebang, but they didnt work at all aye.....So basically weve just gotten another ID off a girl whose not going to schoolies who looks almost exactly like my friend.....Ur probably better off doing that, finding sum1 who kinda looks like u and whose not going to schoolies and borrowing their ID..... :)<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lela</div><div class="date">20-10-2005, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pub or bar...fake id, such as corny international student stuff has a higher chance of working.<br />
<br />
nightclubs...key pass or licence only (usually), some bouncers will scrutinise it very carefully and will reject those who dont look like the pic, even if it is you<br />
<br />
getting the pass out stamp always works well though, just dont smudge it too much. the busier the place the better, as they wont think twice if they dont remember your face<br />
<br />
ps. jay, he'd be better off paying someone who looks like him to take out another licence. the international i.d. is good as back up to prove you have another form of photo id. by itslef its a bit dodge</div></div><hr />

One thing I have seen a lot of people do really successfully, although it doesn't really matter anymore cos all these people will be 18 by now - but loads of people born in '86, when they went for their licence, and they wrote in the year 1986 they'd do it kind of messily so it looked like 1980. totally foolproof.... I also know one chick that when she got her licence at 16, she wasn't even trying to trick the system, they just screwed it up and it said she was born in 1978, and she was from '86.

<br />
Firstly, I can't see how anyone could describe what you said as &quot;simply showing us an alternate way of getting a FID&quot;, since you started by calling everyone who's written in this thread as absolutely stupid. You went on to try and discourage us from making the effort of getting a fake id... now you claim you have nothing against FIDs?...right. And by that, what exactly is this &quot;alternative way&quot; you speak of? being a dumbc.unt and gettin done by the pigs?? getting some random to buy us drinks? or getting a copy of a friends licence with a different pic? - Which of course NO ONE has ever thought of. THANKYOU!! captain obvious. :cool:  <br />
<br />
Btw, I'm completely devastated being called an ignorant tool by you.... I just don't know how I can go on, now that I know of the complete ignorance i've lived my entire life in... maybe I should just slit my wrists :rotfl:</div></div><hr />

Sometimes, things that dont seem to be a big deal can have serious consequences. If you are arrested for an offence, you may be fingerprinted and photographed. If you are convicted of a criminal offence, you could have difficulty getting a job or even be prevented from getting a visa to travel overseas.<br />
_____________________________<br />
 <br />
With those offences listed, take into account that you won't necessarily just be hit with one fine. They could get you on a combination of things - add to that whatever other offences they want to wack on top like drunk n disorderly etc.<br />
 <br />
There is a special task force of police including detectives that police fake IDs and every year they collect literally hundreds of fake IDs and there are tons of court appearances.</div></div><hr />

I'm really dressed about this because I really want to have a good time and get involved in all the activities and not be left out of what my friends are doing!...HELP ME PPPPPLLLLLEEEEAAAASSSSEEEE!!!  :banghead:</div></div><hr />

What I would do for the first few days is ask your friends if you can do some underage activities and then the next few days I would attempt at getting into clubs/pubs etc with your friends ID. That way if you get busted and they send you packing you would of atleast got to experience some of schoolies. Remember, you're a girl and bouncers tend to be fairly lenient with females.</div></div><hr />

your next best chance is to just get someone elses, if you get caught with a scratched one you cant exactly just run away cos they got ya details sittin in thier hand and then ya up on fraud.</div></div><hr />

I turn 18 like a week before schoolies. And thats a packed week, so I will only have my L's. Which was taken when I was 16 and I look WAY different. People dont even accept if for ID as my self now.....<br />
<br />
What kind of card can I get that they will accept when Im 17? And I dont want to have to go get a renewed L's card...<br />
<br />
As for the scratching. If looks crap. Thats it. Nothing else. My mates did it. The number on the back of the card are just to different for starters. And people pick up on that straight away.<br />
<br />
But the borrowing card works some times. My mate has a older brother who looks EXACTLY like him (sept hes taller. They both even are startgin to bald...) And he gets away with that. <br />
<br />
I tried to get into a nightclub without a ID... Saying i had my wallet stoled, worked....<br />
<br />
Story<br />
I went to a pub round the cornor and had a mate (over 18) and he went in and I said my mate had my wallet and just walked in (Fluke) <br />
<br />
Then came out and talked to the bouncers later so they would rememeber me, but forgotten that I havent shown ID. Told them my (fake)name and birth in general convosation. <br />
<br />
Then I went to the bar and reported my wallet stolen and gave them my (fake)name and birth<br />
<br />
Then went back to the club and and said I had my wallet stolen at the pub, they radioed the bouncer at the pub and he said I was O.K, and let me in.....<br />
<br />
Pure Goodluck and Genius Thinking... I have no idea how it worked, but it did....</div></div><hr />

u could also have a look at the Keypass id's that you apply for at the police stations, they are accepted at all night clubs, oor you could just get a proof of age card. thats probably ur best bet, but they cost about 50$ as far as i know. <br />
theres alot of options, justy look around, getin a new l's is probably ya best option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can vouch for what dominic is saying.<br />
<br />
I recently left my wallet on top of the car and drove off. naturally when i realised it was already goneskies.<br />
Depending on which club you go to in the city or valley, they will either say mate this is a duplicate u got more ID, only some places dont care. I can say that family nightclub in the valley (brisbane) does not care. to me this seems very shady as rules are different. <br />
<br />
Now that im 18 (about 11mnths now) im looking for ways to get into clubs for free. Some clubs use UV stamps, which can only be seen under UV black lights. Once you go there once you can see what the UV stamp shape is, so im buying a UV pen, to draw on myself b4 i go there :)<br />
<br />
and also other clubs just use coloured stamps, diff colours for diff nights, once u know the pattern (which only takes a few times of going and paying) u can find out what coloursthey use when, and then just make ur own stamp with coloured ink.</div></div><hr />

Theres heaps of other things on at schoolies anyway. if u wanna hook up with girls its just as easy to walk along the beach or cavill avenue ANY time of the day or night and try your chances at chatting them up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Often this is hard to find so i have found numereous other methods which are all succesfull anmd have been done.<br />
<br />
1. Adjusting you L's- there is two ways of doin this. One you use nail polish remover and remove the month and year at the back of the card and also remove just the date on the front of the card. You then print the exact font of the card on contact paper in your printer for both the back and front of your L's. Both forms of font can be found simple on microsoft word.<br />
<br />
The other method in which i recommend is nail polishing the 1988 into a 1983 on ther back. You then do the same for the front using a cotton bud with nail polish remover. The secret to this method is preparation. You must tape the back and front to avoid removing other areas and making simple mistakes. In this method it is vital you purchase one of those spungers that have both a yellow and green side. You use the rough side to smooth in the removed square on the back makin it impossible to tell it's fake.<br />
<br />
2. Faking yuour identity- This is the best method yet the most risky. However three of my mates have been sucessful in doin this. It involves purchasing either your brothers or sisters or friends deatails such as there birth certificate, bank details and other forms of proof. You then walk into vicroads with prefable your brother or sister and say u lost ur L's and your bro/ sis say she lost her P's. You then wait and go to the next counter. They look on the database and realise this is actually u and ur bro and give u a receite. You then asked to have both brand new photos. Then you simple swap receites as you go to get ur photo so u have ur bros ID with ur photo on it.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Passports, Drivers LIcence, Keypass's are suitable ID but NO birth certificate would be accepted. They have only limited sources of identification that can be accepted. This about tells you what you will need. it is the same Australia wide. So go into your local pub and check out the posters they have of ID that they will accept. It will be the same there.</div></div><hr />

I even fell down the stairs when we walked away haa... its all about looking decent and how ya talk to the bouncer. CONFIDENCE gets you in not a good ID.<br />

anyway. there is a few ways. The key is in the slip. get a good looking laminate slip and your right. making the ID part of it is EASY<br />

you don't need clearance to join. this is an obvious place where **** like this is gunna get spoken about so they (being the ppl who r gunna care about fake ids) can join up and look at this ****.<br />
<br />

I've moved this thread out of the members only section as the extra traffic is no longer a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i.e. looking at the photo<br />
<br />
checking if it is fake<br />
<br />
looking you up on database<br />
<br />
Curious.<br />
<br />
No one's answered! How thoroughly do the bouncers check the photo on the ID? I have a friend's unhole-punched learners who looks like me quite a bit.. It's just that she's a week from 20 at Schoolies time.. Suss?<br />
Are Gold Coast bouncers lenient on girls like they are in Melbourne? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
definitely fined.<br />
<br />
 ''Its not just a case of taking the false ID from the person trying to get in,'' he said.<br />
  ''The police will attend and a prosecution will commence.''<br />
  Supt Keogh said it was important that schoolies understood the ramifications of trying to get into a licensed venue with a fake ID, including a $300 on-the-spot fine.<br />
  ''Security providers with all the licensed venues are very much on their game in trying to identify kids coming in with false IDs,'' he said.</div></div><hr />
