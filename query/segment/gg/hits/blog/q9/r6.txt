Destination: Phuket   Phuket  Famously called 'Pearl of the South', Phuket is a heavenly concoction of many wonders; ancient relics left behind by foreign invaders, majestic mountains, gorgeous beaches, noisy markets and a fantastic night life. It is Thailand's most dynamic tourist destination for obvious reasons. Clinging to the Andaman Sea on the western shore of the country, Phuket offers a wide range of experiences to travellers, making it difficult to pick and choose. From the towering magnificence of Phuket's Big Buddha that is set atop the Nakkerd Hills, to the splendours of the wacky Fantasea shows, Phuket is an island of fun and frolic. Phuket's cultural attractions make for an unforgettable holiday. At the centre of the  Thepkessatri Main Road which connects many parts of Phuket, is the famous  Two Heroine's Monument . The monument is dedicated to the memory of two sisters,  Kunying Jan and Mook , who led their country to victory against Burmese attack in the 18th century. The  Phuket Philatelic Museum on Montri Road is a heritage gem philatelists will love. Old Phuket Town's walking street has curious sights like the Amulet Market, small shrines like the  Chinese Jui Tui Shrine, the Shrine of the Serene Light, and the Thavorn Hotel Museum , which has a collection of queer, fascinating memorabilia. Cross the threshold of the Old Phuket Town and you are transported to another era. The  Thalang Road at the centre takes you to a stretch of long shop cum houses constructed in Sino-Portugal architecture.  Soi Romanee , a fascinating lane near Thalang, once a Red Light Area or pleasure district is now an eclectic quarter. Take notice of small wonders like this, and you find yourself slowly unlocking Phuket's other side.  Read More  Places to See Phuket is an amazing summer retreat. Once a major trade route between China and India, it is both the cultural and tourism nerve centre of Thailand. Lined with numerous little islands, Phuket has exciting prospects for beach enthusiasts. The island is home to several quaint beaches, of which  Banana beach or Coral Island is the most reputed. It emits a vibe of mystery with its quietude and serenity as it sits hidden amidst the  Bang Thao and Nai Ton coastlines. The coast is also a great place to watch rainforest hornbills. Try angling in the  Phuket Fishing Park if you want to spend a fun day out at the  Sawai Lake or watch crocodile tamers at the  Crocodile Park . If you want to know more about the aquatic life in and around Phuket, visit the  Phuket Aquarium at Cape Panwa. Although it is a tad uninviting for a beach, it is dotted with numerous luxurious resorts like  Novotal Panwa Beach Resort , and is home to the local fishing community of sea gypsies. In search of a quiet seashore where you want to relax your way with fewer people around? Options are unlimited ranging from beaches like Kamala, Kalim, Kata Noi and Nai Han. Give in to the luxury of a spa at a nearby resort and let a masseuse work his way through your muscles. But if you are a party animal, head to  Kata Yai beach or Patong beach and indulge. With the largest strip of resorts in Thailand, Phuket has countless bars, all night music and to top it all, a legalized sex industry. To children and families,  Fantasea , popularly known as 'the Disneyland of Thailand', is another place that calls out and jolts you awake. This is the best night-time amusement park on the island. Trips to smaller Phuket Islands like  Kata Yai, Ko Bon, Ko Maphrao, Ko Sire and the twin islands of  Ko Racha-Ko Raya add a touch of exotica to your holiday. Each island has its own charm and special sea sport. If the idea of wind surfing excites you, Kata Yai is the best option. While scuba divers have fun in the twin islands, people who want to try snorkelling head to  Ko Bon Island . It is a lovely walk around  Ko Maphrao (Coconut Island) and it is only too inviting to sip coconut water beneath swaying palms. Pause a bit at the sea gypsy colony at  Ko Sire Island and enjoy a fresh seafood platter on the beachfront. Things to do Phuket breathes fun and sunshine all year through. With a tolerant attitude towards many native customs and lifestyles, it offers a lot more than beaches and water sports. The island proudly flaunts the sensational spirit of its famous ethnic cabaret dances on one side and the toughness of  Muay Thai (traditional martial arts) on the other. Succumb to it all. A customary herbal Thai massage and spa treatment at  Patong beach is a great way to relax your senses. Explore Phuket's rainforests in the northern part of island through the unspoiled expanse of the  Khao Lok and Khao Sak National Parks . Tourists can opt for an elephant safari or hike through the wilderness. The elephant is believed to be the King of the Jungle in Thai folklore and is considered lucky, so go on a safari if you have the chance to!  Nakkerd Hills can be reached from  Chalong Bay or Kata Bay , both known for extreme boating activities. Sea kayaking into the collapsed cave systems of  Phang Nga Bay is fun even when it rains! If you need to feel an adrenalin rush, head to Kathu district to try bungee jumping. Phuket is a delightful place to drive around and simply enjoy the view. A short drive between the Promtep Point and coastline of Kata is definitely worth a day tour. Hire a boat and row to Phang-Nga Bay to view arresting limestone formations, a sheer natural miracle.  James Bond Island , where the famous Bond flick, The Man with a Golden Gun, was filmed is a magnificent rock pinnacle that is a star attraction here. Ko Panyee, a small sea gypsy island entirely built on stilts along the coast, is an interesting sight. The Night Market in the Old Town is the best place to try a wide range of Thai food. Places to eat Phuket's food culture is surprisingly multi-ethnic, occasionally infused with a Thai touch. Noodle dishes with pork or chicken are popular and available at noodle shops through Phuket local haunts like  Mi Ton Pho and Mihun Pa Chan .  Khanom Jin is a type of noodle dish eaten with sauce and vegetables. Try the local favourite  Nam Phrik Kung Siap . Krachang Restaurant at the eastern part of Phuket has fish items that you may not have heard of like Moray Eels or Blowfishes. Thai oyster garnished with lime, chilli and other spices is their specialty. Mor Modung food joint near the Phuket Zoo amidst Mangroves is another favoured hang out for foodies. It has heaps of outdoor huts where you can have a nice helping of delicious fish steamed in salt while enjoying the spectacular view. The Bangpae food stalls near the  Thalang Waterfalls and Mangroves are famous for the mouth-watering Tom Yum Soup, Shrimp Paste and Blue Crab.  Keawjay Restaurant , another popular restaurant, serves special Khao Padh Gei (Chicken Fried Rice) and offers a wide variety of baked sweets. Had enough of Thai food or reluctant to try? Then, you may want to turn your attention to the fancy Italian Bistro,  Salvatore's restaurant . Some dishes here are prepared Thai way but excellent all the same. Wash it down with fine wine. Shopping Shopping in Phuket is a pleasure beyond measure. The island has numerous bazaars that cater to all kinds of tastes like the open air village market, night market, food market and other glitzy shopping malls. Refined pearls, antiques, pewter goods, jewellery, Nielloware (unique Thai handicrafts) and clothes with Thai designs are popular buys. Thai antiques like wooden carvings, statues and fabrics are irresistible buys. Phuket is known worldwide for its esteemed antique shops, each focusing on a specific culture. Visit the  Chans Antique House and the Fine Orient for a taste of Chinese culture and Buddhism depicted in finely carved furniture and images. While Sivella Antiques is mainly about jewellery and porcelain, antique shops like Sontigue and Soul of Asia have a collection of art and handicrafts from Asian countries. The  Talad Sod (wet market) and the  Talad Nat (weekend market) are two kinds of markets that you will come across in Phuket, the former being permanent and the latter being temporary. Disorganized, vibrant and noisy, these markets are spread around places like Patong, Karon, Kata, Kamala, Rawai and Phuket Town. The  Central Festival Mall at the end of Phuket Town, and  Jung Ceylon Mall at Patong are the two giant malls in Phuket which tourists throng for international brands as well as Thai silk scarves, hats, purses and slippers. Look out for curios in tiny little shops lined at the sides of Montri, Ratsadha and Thilok-U-Thit roads, all in the Phuket Town area.
