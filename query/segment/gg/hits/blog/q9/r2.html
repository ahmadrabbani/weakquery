<br />
   <br />
By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN <br />
 <br />
 India is a country that had me at hello. Call me biased, but I have a soft spot for countries of one billion people, speaking a hundred different languages and practicing a variety of religions, whose people hold regular free and fair elections and, despite massive poverty, still produce generations of doctors and engineers who help to make the world a more productive and peaceful place. Sure, as todays bombings in India illustrate, it has its problems  but it is not Iraq. It is a beacon of tolerance and stability. <br />
 <br />
So I applaud President Bushs desire to form a deeper partnership with India. There is only one thing I would not do for that cause: endorse  in its current form  the nuclear arms deal that the Bush team just cut with New Delhi. I am all for finding a creative way to bring India into the worlds nuclear family. India deserves to be treated differently than Iran. But we cant do it in a way that could melt down the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and foster a nuclear arms race in South Asia. <br />
 <br />
Whats the problem? India has never signed the N.P.T., which is the international legal framework that limited the worlds nuclear club to the U.S., China, Russia, Britain and France. For decades, U.S. policy has been very consistent: we do not sell civilian nuclear technology to any country that has not signed the N.P.T. And since that included India, India could never buy reactors, even for its civilian power needs, from America. <br />
 <br />
But with India eager to buy U.S. nuclear technology, and the U.S. eager to build India into an economic and geostrategic counterweight to China, the Bush team wanted  rightly  to find a way to get India out of the corner it put itself in when it first set off a nuclear blast in 1974. Under the Bush-India deal, India would designate 14 of its 22 nuclear power reactors as &quot;civilian,&quot; to be put under international safeguards, leaving the other 8 free from inspections and able to produce as much bomb-grade plutonium as India wanted. In return, U.S. companies would be able to sell India civilian-use nuclear reactors and technology. <br />
 <br />
This is a troubling deal for two reasons. First, it could only undermine the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Yes, I know, the Bush team doesnt believe in treaties and says the treaty isnt restraining the rogues anyway. But this treaty is the legal basis by which we have been able to build coalitions against the nuclear rogues to restrain them from spreading W.M.D. One of the key legal bases for isolating Saddam Hussein was that hed violated the N.P.T., which Iraq had signed. The legal basis by which we are building a coalition against Irans going nuclear is the N.P.T. Under the N.P.T., we board ships suspected of carrying W.M.D. Japan, Brazil and Argentina all chose to forgo nuclear weapons to gain access to foreign nuclear technology by abiding by the N.P.T. What are they going to think if India gets a free pass? <br />
 <br />
What should we have done? Bob Einhorn, who has worked on nonproliferation for every administration since Nixons, has the right idea: Tell India that it can have this deal  provided it does something hard that would clearly reinforce the global nonproliferation regime. And that would be halting all production of weapons-grade material, thereby capping Indias stockpile of nuclear bomb ingredients where it is. That could be a lever to get Pakistan to do the same. The fewer bomb-making materials around, the less likely it is for any to fall into the hands of terrorists. <br />
 <br />
&quot;The Bush administration proposed such a production cutoff in negotiations, but dropped the idea when India balked,&quot; Mr. Einhorn said. &quot;India says it is willing to adopt the same responsibilities and practices as the other nuclear powers. It so happens that the five original nuclear powers  U.S., U.K., France, Russia and China  have all stopped producing fissile material for weapons. If we are going to bring India into the club, it should do so as well.&quot; <br />
 <br />
India says it needs to keep producing nuclear material to have a more credible deterrent. I cant judge that. All I know is that we should not go ahead with this deal until India is ready to halt its production of weapons-grade material. <br />
 <br />
&quot;The problem the Bush administration faces in selling the nuclear deal is not, as the president has said, that some people just dont want to change or that they are focused on outdated concerns,&quot; Mr. Einhorn argued. &quot;People are willing to change. They want to support the presidents India initiative, even modify longstanding policies. But they want to do it in a way that also serves an objective that is hardly outdated: preventing nuclear proliferation.&quot;<br />

<br />
what our friend Friedman forgot is that there are greater evils and rougues like China that need to be stopped before pointing at India. US already has civilian nuke deal with China, a signatory to NPT in only paper but a real rogue in the spirit of NPT. if such states can get nuke tech, why cant India, with its spotless non-prolifiration record? Isnt India a more meritous candidate than China in this regard? also, what Friedman stated is wrong abt India using this fuel to advance our nuke stockpile. all the fuel that we are going to buy from NSG countries is only for our 14 civilian reactors. the weapons-grade material is going to come from our 8 military reactors which will only use India's own Uranium reserves (said to be around 70,000 tonnes), which is fast depleting.<br />
<br />
And that would be halting all production of weapons-grade material, thereby capping Indias stockpile of nuclear bomb ingredients where it is. That could be a lever to get Pakistan to do the same. The fewer bomb-making materials around, the less likely it is for any to fall into the hands of terrorists. <br />
<br />
so how will stopping us make pukes cap their stockpile? Friedman forgot abt the faggot right next to pukes called China! it has been and will continue to supply pukes nuke material, no matter what the world says, until pukes bite their ass as they did to US!</div></div><hr />

<br />
wat is the NPT anyway? Is it being followed? The author himself raises these questions. I'm sure any state doing slightly okay economically must be thinking of acquiring or developing the nuclear technology.<br />
<br />
To develop and prosper economically, India needs power and roads. The Civilian Nuclear Power program was and is a much needed requirement for India. The coal reserves are getting depleted day-by-day and their use to generate power at the thermal power plants is creating a huge green house effect. The only option is to seek a civilian nuclear program.<br />
<br />
I dont have a great understanding of the implications of India producing more nuclear material. My views on this issue are somewhat lay-person-ish. If other states &quot;in the club&quot; are producing / have produced enough nuclear material to their liking / need, then how can they expect any other state to limit themselves? How does one judge how much is enough?</div></div><hr />
