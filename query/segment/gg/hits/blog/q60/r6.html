<p align="center">BALTIMORE ROBBER EXILED TO 28 YEARS IN PRISON FOR SEVEN ROBBERIES<br>
OF GAS STATIONS AND LIQUOR STORES</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Baltimore, Maryland - U.S. District Judge Richard D. Bennett sentenced Quindell Ford, age 29, of Baltimore, today to 28 years in prison, followed by five years of supervised release, for robbery and  brandishing a gun during a  robbery in connection with seven armed robberies of six businesses.  Judge Bennett also entered an order requiring Ford to pay restitution of $1,020.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The sentence was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein; Special Agent in Charge Richard A. McFeely of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; Baltimore County State’s Attorney Scott Shellenberger; Baltimore County Police Chief James W. Johnson; Baltimore City State’s Attorney Patricia C. Jessamy; and Baltimore Police Commissioner Frederick H. Bealefeld III.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>According to Ford’s plea agreement, on December 22, 2008, Ford, Todd Bell and Trevon Jones entered the Texaco Station at 2415 York Road in Timonium, Maryland. Bell struck a cashier in the head with a gun twice before the cashier fell to the ground.  The robbers stole money from the cash drawer, five cartons of cigarettes, and the cashier’s wallet and cell phone. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>On December 24, 2008,  Ford and Bell entered the Charles Street Liquors store at 1122 South Charles Street in Baltimore with a third robber.  The robbers grabbed the store owner and threatened him and a store employee with a semiautomatic handgun.  The robbers took cash and a loaded revolver from the store; cash from the store employee; and cash, an engraved silver money clip and a wallet from the owner. The robbers then bound the owner’s hands with duct tape and left the store.<br>
    <br>
</p>
<p>On December 29, 2008, Ford, Bell and Jones robbed a Shell Station at 9101 Snowden River Parkway, Columbia, Maryland.  One of the robbers drew a weapon and demanded that the cashier get on the ground.  The robbers then stole lottery tickets, money, cigars and other items. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>On January 7, 2009, Ford, Bell and a third individual robbed a Shell Station at 30 Main Street in Reisterstown, Maryland.  One of the robbers drew a weapon and hit a cashier in the head when the cashier had trouble opening the register, forcing him to the ground.  The robbers hit the cashier again and stole two cash register drawers filled with cash, packs of cigarettes, cigars, scratch-off lottery tickets and the cashier’s  wallet. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>On January 7, 2009, Ford, Bell and another individual robbed an Exxon Station at 8485 Honeygo Boulevard in Baltimore.  One of the robbers began beating an employee over the head with a gun.  The robbers then forced him to the ground and stole money, cigarettes, lottery tickets and other items from the store. <br>
    <br>
  On January 16, 2009, Ford,  Jones  and a third person robbed Euro Liquors at 10512 Reisterstown Road, Owings Mills, Maryland. One of the robbers put a gun to the owner’s head,   bound his hands with tape, took him to the basement and removed the video surveillance system from the store.  One of the other owners was also present, and a robber pointed a gun in his face and forced him to the ground.  The robber taped the owner’s hands together and told him to lay face down on the floor.  The robbers took money, cash and alcohol from the store. <br>
  <br>
  On March 21, 2009,  Ford, Jones and a third individual again robbed the Charles Street Liquors store. As the owner was at the register talking to one of the robbers, another robber drew a semiautomatic handgun from his waistband, charged around the counter, pointed the handgun at the owner and hit him in the head with the weapon.  The robber stole money from the cash register and the cash box in the rear of the store.  Jones  took a gun from the owner and alcohol. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Todd Bell, age 29,  and Trevon Jones, age 28, both of Baltimore, pleaded guilty to their roles in the robberies and were sentenced to 32 years and 12 years in prison, respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Mr. Rosenstein thanked the FBI, the Baltimore County Police Department, the Baltimore County State’s Attorney’s Office, the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office and the Baltimore City Police Department for their work in this investigation and prosecution. Mr. Rosenstein commended Assistant U.S. Attorney Bonnie S. Greenberg, who prosecuted this case.<br>
