 Minnesota Politics: Ford Bell out

 .comment-link {margin-left:.6em;}         Tuesday, July 11, 2006  Ford Bell out   Yes, Ford Bell has dropped out of the race for the DFL spot, leaving Amy Klobuchar a clear shot. Bell wasn't going to win, so better to get out now than lose in the primary. Now Klobuchar and the DFL can focus on Mark Kennedy and his record, and there is a lot of ammunition out there. Hey Mark, get ready to have your best friend George W. Bush hung around your neck, and get ready to explain all of the votes you have taken to help special interests while screwing over Minnesotans. Better conserve your energy, because you will be doing this for a LONG time.    posted by MN Politics Guru @  22:05               0 Comments:  Post a Comment   Links to this post: See links to this post      <$BlogBacklinkTitle$>          <$BlogBacklinkSnippet$>   posted by <$BlogBacklinkAuthor$> @ <$BlogBacklinkDateTime$>     Create a Link  << Home      About Me Name:  MN Politics Guru   Location: Minnesota   View my complete profile     Atom Feed E-mail me I may post e-mails sent to me on this blog.
