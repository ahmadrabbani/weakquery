At the Chicago auto show , Ford shows off a freshening that enhances the Edge’s appearance, overhauls the interior, and, although not directly addressing the issue of mass, will increase performance.  Like most mid-cycle refreshes, the Edge’s 2011 update starts with a nose job. Every panel up front is new: hood, fenders, grille, and fascia. The result is a sultrier shape than the blocky original Edge—the headlights are narrower, the three-bar grille dips deeper into the fascia, and the overall look is softened and rounded—but still clearly descendant from it. Around back, the hatch is new, with taillights that ditch the trendy clear lenses of the original model for more timeless red ones.  Functional Changes   Underneath that new hood, the Edge will have a selection of two new engines and one updated unit. The new base engine will be a 2.0-liter turbocharged, direct-injected EcoBoost four-cylinder. Power figures have not been released yet, but figure on about 230 hp and 240 lb-ft of torque. Mid-level SEL models will get the 3.5-liter V-6 from the previous Edge, but updated with variable timing on both intake and exhaust camshafts, with output increasing 20 hp and 3 lb-ft, to 285 and 253, respectively.  Top-of-the-line Sport models, in addition to unique black grille slats, smoked head- and taillights, and black-trimmed, 22-inch wheels; get Ford’s 3.7-liter V-6, which delivers a relatively modest bump in hp—to 305—over the 3.5, but a torque gain of 27 lb-ft, for a total of 280. All three engines will be paired with six-speed automatics, with the Sport featuring standard paddle shifters that are unavailable with the other engines.  It’s What’s Inside That Counts   The Edge’s new interior is perhaps even more attractive than the sheetmetal. A sleek new center stack steals the show, housing Ford’s new MyFord and MyFord Touch vehicle-interface systems. These two are the next evolution of Ford’s Sync. MyFord will be standard on all 2011 Edges, but MyFord Touch costs extra. Both are vehicle-management systems using a small LCD screen in the gauge cluster—the fancier MyFord Touch gets two, one on either side of the speedometer—and a larger LCD screen in the center stack.  The small screens in the IP are controlled by five-way switches (up, down, left, and right arrows plus a center “select” button) on the steering-wheel spokes, while the center is operated via touch. The left IP screen is the only one MyFord buyers get, and it displays vehicle information such as stability-control settings, a tachometer, or trip-computer information. The screen to the right of the speedometer—again, only available with MyFord Touch—is reserved for audio, phone, navigation, and climate-control info. T...
