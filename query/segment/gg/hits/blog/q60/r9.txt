I bought my 2010 Edge in September 2009 and had a terrible purchase experience from the start. The guy who manages the financing first presented me with 5 different contracts that were either the wrong car model or the wrong price we originally agreed to. When he finally found the correct contract, everyone at that dealership RUDELY rushed me out the door without even showing me the car's features. 2. To add to my troubles, it now seems as though my car is double-registered with the Motor Vehicle Commission, as I receive multiple registration renewal bills and multiple inspection extension stickers. This is probably because when I traded in my old 1997 Ford, I requested that the dealer transfer my old plates to the new Edge, at which time they acted like they could not do that. Bell Ford should be embarrassed with their ignorance. 3. Please note that I have now paid off my car loan (as of April 2011 paid off in full) and as of July 2011 I have yet to receive the title. So I contacted my lender and they informed me that BELL FORD never sent them the original car title. So now I have to waste my time calling Bell Ford DAILY and everyone who works there just keeps on giving me the runaround, saying they will call you back (i.e. you know where they pretend to write down your information, but really don't), yet nobody ever calls me back! I spoke to Roger, (the owner of this awful dealership), who PROMISED multiple times to call me back, yet never did! By the way, instead of trying to look into my problem, Roger, just likes to inform you how he has been in business for over "who the hell really cares" years or how his wife has an Edge and really likes it. Yeah that's all nice Roger, but nobody cares nor wants to hear you boast about pointless tidbits and do us all a favor and light a flame under your lazy, useless staff and find my car title! By the way, I own a Mercedes and quality of service their dealerships is always top notch. But for those of you thinking of buying a Ford motor vehicle in NJ, do yourself a favor and do not buy or seek service from Bell Ford of Colonia, NJ. Ford dealerships in NJ are a dime a dozen, so go somewhere else!

Bell Ford of Colonia, NJ is nothing but scammers. DO NOT SERVICE YOUR VEHICLE AT BELL FORD. They either (a) are purposely breaking it so that you have to keep coming back or (b) their technicians are beyond stupid. I bought a 2007 Ford Mustang and was out of the vehicle for 4-5 months in the first year. Ford apparently has a horrible supply chain and it takes MONTHS to get parts delivered on a brand new vehicle. Bell Ford Colonia sold me the clunker of all cars and treated me like a garbage customer. NEVER BUY OR SERVICE A VEHICLE AT BELL FORD, COLONIA NJ! Be very glad you read this before buying from this location or Ford vehicles in general.

As of today no title, regristration or license plates. So far I have received the following excuses. 1. Owner died Dealership was still open for business. Employees were still working. 2. Clunker program I did not trade in any vehicle. 3. Wrong vin #. Just another excuse. If you want customer service go to another Ford dealership who cares.
