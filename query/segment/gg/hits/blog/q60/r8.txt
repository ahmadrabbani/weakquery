All the above are 164 tooth bells.  http://www.mustangtek.com/Bellhousin...lhousings.html http://www.davidkeetoploaders.com/be...ingidchart.htm Ebay usually has a few of the cast iron units selling. Im not sure if a T5 bell will fit a 164 tooth flywheel.

The belt tensioner comes close, but has about 1/4" clearance.  __________________ Bayonne used jeep                        Remove Advertisements   Sponsored Links  Ford Muscle Forums  Advertisement                      «  Previous Thread |  Next Thread  »  Currently Active Users Viewing This Thread: 1  (0 members and 1 guests)        Thread Tools     Show Printable Version    Email this Page        Posting Rules    You  may not post new threads You  may not post replies You  may not post attachments You  may not edit your posts BB code is  On  Smilies are  On  [IMG] code is  On  HTML code is  Off  Trackbacks are  On  Pingbacks are  On  Refbacks are  On  Forum Rules                 Similar Threads     Thread Thread Starter Forum Replies Last Post   [wtb] bell housing   hofficergrover  Wanted  7  11-15-2009  06:07 PM     429 Cj Bell Housing   mustang4665  Wanted  2  06-06-2009  10:17 AM     Bell Housing   galaxie  Galaxie Pages  3  05-16-2009  08:16 PM     T5 Bell housing   Stroker83  Wanted  3  07-03-2008  03:59 PM     390 Bell Housing   66sedan  Mustang Pages (1974-1978)  0  05-24-2006  12:36 PM       All times are GMT -7.
