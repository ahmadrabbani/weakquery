The awardee, Min-Kyu Choi, devised the idea for a more portable plug while carrying around a conventional plug to charge his laptop, accord to the news source. His invention was selected from a total of 90 entries, including  fashion designer  Alexander McQueen's last collection, which received one of seven category awards.  Choi's folding plus was also named a category winner earlier this month by a panel of judges that included artist Antony Gormley, designer Tom Dixon, Wired magazine editor David Rowan and broadcaster Janet Street-Porter.  This year's categories included architecture, fashion, furniture, graphics, interactive, product, and transport, according to the website of the Design Museum, which disburses the awards.

Deyan Sudjic, director of the museum, told the news source that the folding plug is "a practical but elegant demonstration of what design can do to make everyday life so much better."
