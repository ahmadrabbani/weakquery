It gives me a chance to rant about the pointlessness of award shows. As it turns out, there is no Plug Awards for 2009. No announcement was made and the website hasn't been updated since March 2008. It's now May. Safe to assume its a victim of the economic downturn? I guess there's no point of having a corporate-sponsored, indie rock award show when you can't make it big, flashy, self-centered and overblown. Then you can't get name acts to play in front of banners that pimp out computers and energy drinks. So when the dollars aren't there, indie rock won't get their props. Proves that the Plug Awards were about $$$.    May 15, 2009 at 01:10 AM   |  Permalink       Comments    Verify your Comment Previewing your Comment  Posted by:    |       This is only a preview.
