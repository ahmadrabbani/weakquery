Hit me up with good stuff at dfactorpop at yahoo dot com.                  2/11/2007   PLUG Indie Awards   The other awards show honoring music this weekend was held in NYC at Irving Plaza - Called the  PLUG Awards , it honored music not on major labels. That means indie, and winning for the Indie Rock Album of the Year was Yo La Tengo, with their killer CD from late '06  I Am Not Afraid of You And I Will Beat Your Ass .  The show also awarded numerous fine, fresh young bands who tour, release records and write good songs (without getting all blinged out and hiring 100 dancers to get their songs across). See cool  Nathan Blaney pix  here . Read more at  Brooklyn Vegan , which rightfully won for Music Blog of the year. BV is unstoppably great. May BV continue to show all the great energy in '07 that he had in '06!    PLUG Indie Awards   Fresh to you from Dfactor   at  9:13 PM                         1 comments:   nathan Blaney said...
