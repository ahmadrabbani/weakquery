 Notes from underground: Book Review: Portobello, by Ruth Rendell

     Notes from underground   The main aim of this blog is to interpret the Christian Order in the light of current affairs, philosophy, literature and the arts -- and vice versa. So it's about ideas. Social, political and religious comment. Links, notes on people, places, events, books, movies etc. And mainly a place where I can post half-baked ideas in the hope that other people, or the passing of time, will help me to bake them.         03 February 2011   Book Review: Portobello, by Ruth Rendell       Portobello by  Ruth Rendell My rating:  3 of 5 stars London's Portobello Road got its name from the War of Jenkins's Ear and is the setting of this book, where several people's lives intersect in various ways, sometimes accidentally, but also sometimes with far-reaching consequences, including two murders.  Ruth Rendell writes two kinds of crime novels. Some are whodunits, featuring her detective protagonist Inspector Wexford. Others concentrate on the characters, and how people's character and circumstances lead them to commit a crime. Perhaps one could call the second kind  whydunits . This, in a sense, is neither. The crimes are almost incidental to the story. The main focus is on the interaction of the characters and how their lives are changed as a result, often in unintended ways. Rendell's characters are well drawn, but while reading it I found myself more drawn to another book,  Nine lives which I bought while still reading the Rendall one. I found the real-life characters more interesting than fictional ones, no matter how well drawn.  View all my reviews   Posted by  Steve Hayes   at   07:38                  Email This    BlogThis!

I love Ruth Rendell but her most recent books (Portobello, A Monster in the Box, Tigerlily's Orchard) are really not at the same level as her classics. Even as recently as 5-10 years ago, she was still writing her best novels. So I hope that this is a minor bad streak in her writing.    February 03, 2011 3:02 PM               boros1124 said...
