I am a wonderful catch, you know. I have a lot of money'         By Marianne Macdonald  12:01AM BST 11 Apr 2005  Comments    Ruth Rendell had a terrible childhood and her adulthood has been tempestuous. But does this help to explain her twin obsessions, psychopaths and punctuality? The crime writer and life peer talks to Marianne Macdonald about death, therapy and the septuagenarian singles scene   I admit I was dreading interviewing the bestselling crime writer Ruth Rendell. She has written 40 novels in her own name (19 of them featuring Reginald Wexford, her phenomenally popular detective), plus 11 more under the pseudonym Barbara Vine. She has sold millions, won prizes and smashed the stuffy norms of crime writing. But she is notoriously tricky.  She won't talk about her childhood. 'No, I don't want to do that, not doing that, never describe my childhood, no, I'm not going to talk about that,' she cried in horrified surprise six years ago, the last time an interviewer dared to raise the subject. She has many fears and phobias. She is a strict vegetarian, is obsessed by routine, is a workaholic and is so petrified by the idea of being late that she always arrives early, which she finds infuriating because she ends up hanging around on street corners.  You can imagine what agony it was, therefore, when I turned up to meet her 20 minutes late (thinking I was ten minutes early). She had already rung her publicist. Her alarmed greeting, as she opened the door of her grand house in Little Venice in west London, was, 'I'd just about given up on you!'  Rendell is 75, fit and upright, incredibly young-looking for her age, with a humour dry as a French chablis. Her hair is dyed ashy blonde; her eyes are unusually blue. On a South Bank Show I had watched about her life, her scared, blinking manner brought to mind a submissive six-year-old. In person she is more poised. It is only gradually you discern the fragile warmth that wanders through her like a jailed spirit.   This is, it has to be said, in total contradiction to the chilly and amoral tone of her novels. She seems to be a Jekyll and Hyde - a life peer, a generous giver to charity, a woman of the utmost respectability who has spent her life writing about weirdos and psychopaths. This is true of the Ruth Rendells, which always have a murder, but is particularly evident in her Barbara Vines. Darker and slower-paced, these seem to spring from a deeper, more compulsive source. Her new Barbara Vine thriller, The Minotaur, is about an autistic man holed up with his dysfunctional family in Essex in the late 1960s. It is written at every level with extraordin-ary assurance, subtlety and control, and centres on yet another murder and yet another psychopathic loner. But why the fascination with psychopaths? Rendell is trying to lean back on the sofa. She gives up and sits forward again. 'Well,' she says in her precise voice, 'I do empathise with people who are driven by dreadful impulses. I think to be driven to want to kill must be such a terrible burden. I try, and I think I succeed, in making my readers feel pity for my psychopaths, because I do.' What fissure does her writing spring from? Why is she so obsessed with murder? Where do people get the impulse to kill? She shoots me a dry glance. 'I don't know! But it's there in a lot of people. It's certainly not there in me. I haven't the slightest desire to kill people.' Except in her fiction? 'Well, I don't think that because it's in my fiction I'm somehow distracting myself from a real desire to do it.' She laughs, then falls silent for a long time. When she was asked nine years ago if she was writing from experience about psychopaths, a long pause ensued. 'I could hardly have reached my age and not suffered terrible unhappiness, distress and breakdown,' Rendell replied. 'We all go through it, unless we are extremely dull or insensitive. I didn't have the sort of breakdown that caused one to be hospitalised, but perhaps today it would.' We are in the downstairs living-room. The drawing-room window overlooks shark-like black houseboats on the canal; but the living-room backs on to the garden, where Rendell's ginger tom, Archie, is forced to endure a pitched battle with the tigerish bengal tom from next door. Black bookcases frame hundreds of volumes. The open-plan kitchen is cream, the coffee-table covered in books - volume three of Proust's In Search of Lost Time (the new translation), Philip Roth, Suetonius. 'If it weren't for a ridiculous literary snobbery about "crime writing", Ruth Rendell would be acclaimed as one of our most important novelists,' John Mortimer once remarked. Others agree that Rendell has shattered the rules of the so-called Golden Age of detective writing (Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers), and is by far the most interesting of British crime writers. But she seems resigned to the fact that she will remain a generic writer in the eyes of the literary establishment, just as she is resigned to the fact that her life is criss-crossed by phobias. These seems to be the legacy of her Swedish mother, Ebba, who fell ill with multiple sclerosis that went undiagnosed for years. She and Rendell's father, Arthur Grasemann (they were both school teachers based in east London), had a terrible marriage, continually shrieking at each other, giving each other the silent treatment and threatening to leave. A sensitive only child, Rendell seems to have found the atmosphere terrifying. In self-defence she created an inner voice that described what was going on as if it was a story, and so her writing began. But the fear remained, streaming out in her terror of being late, her need to keep busy, and her obsession with routine. She often says that she doesn't think any families are ever happy and that the world is an amoral place. I ask her if she has become more flexible about time as she has grown older. 'Certainly not!' she exclaims with asperity. 'If anything, it gets worse. I suppose that would be a reason to have therapy but I don't want to waste time - time!' - she lets out a faint giggle - 'sitting with somebody who talks with me about being unpunctual. I know about all that. I know it's unnecessary and pointless. I'm still like it.' Had she never had therapy? 'I wouldn't do that!'  Why not?  'Well, I used to feel it might take away my ability to write. These days I'm quite content, you know, with everything. I am neurotic, but I live with it. I think most people are, anyway.' Ruth Rendell published her first novel, From Doon with Death, when she was 34. She had started writing after getting married at 20 and having a baby. She had been fired from her first job on the South Woodford local newspaper for writing up the tennis club's annual jamboree without mentioning that the chairman dropped dead while making his speech. The man she married was Don Rendell, her boss on the paper. They stayed together until he died of prostate cancer six years ago, bar a tumultuous period in her mid-forties where she left him, plunged into an affair and then went back and remarried him. 'Of course I do,' she says, moving her arm protectively across her lap, when I ask if she still misses him. 'Sometimes desperately. A very sharp pain. But I do write, I do have my friends, and my son, and my grandsons, and lots of interests, and that makes a lot of difference, you know. I haven't been, as some women are, absolutely shattered.' She considers. 'And some things that apply to women don't apply to me. Some women say as they get older they're no longer noticed: they disappear. Men, for instance, don't see them. Nobody wants them. That doesn't happen to me because of who I am. Not because I'm any more scintillating company, but because I'm Ruth Rendell.' I ask if she would ever remarry. 'No. Why?' she demands with some horror. Isn't it romantic? 'You can be romantic without getting married.' She gives an amused gurgle. 'Probably more so! I could imagine meeting another man. That's possible. I've had two proposals since I've been a widow. But I wouldn't even consider getting married.' I've not had two proposals, I tell her.  'Well, you're young,' she says. 'It's different. People want to marry me for companionship. No thanks! I've got my cats for that!' She smiles. 'I am a wonderful catch, you know. I have a lot of money. That's what you have to bear in mind!' Her age genuinely seems to have no impact on her life. To meet her you would think she was maybe 55: her mind is so on-the-ball, her outlook so broadminded. She is writing as much as ever. A Labour life peer, she goes to the Lords every day. She also campaigns to get more black and Asian people into the arts, and works against slavery, torture and female genital mutilation. Since her husband died she spends a lot of time alone - her son, Simon, lives in Denver, Colorado - but she doesn't seem to mind. 'I like a lot of friends around, and I like the friendliness of the House of Lords, where I have a lot of friends. But I also like a weekend entirely alone. I will sometimes have a totally alone weekend from Friday night to Monday morning and I will like that. I really like it. It means I can read a lot and go out for long walks, and I might write, too.' She gets up at 6am, lets the cats out, works out on her exercise machines, and writes from 8.30am to noon. Plots never dry up.  'Something happens. I read something or somebody tells me something and the idea is started. I got the idea for The Minotaur, for instance, from, thinking, "How would it be for a family who had one member with an illness they completely misdiagnosed and they blamed this person, and eventually it was discovered what it was? And then what happens, in what is fashionably called the dysfunctional family?"' Like her mother, I say. Rendell fields this flank attack with a surprising degree of calm. 'Yes, she was, she was,' she agrees mildly. 'But I didn't really think of that. So different, isn't it?' She sniffs. 'Um. And there must have been many, many people who have been, and still are being, misdiagnosed.' But did her father not realise her mother had MS? Rendell clasps her hands. 'Well, no. Nobody knew.' Which could lead to all sorts of problems - you might unfairly blame someone for, say, their clumsiness? 'Well, it did, a little. Um, I mean, with, um, the, with, um. The sufferer from MS is rather clumsy and tends to fall. But I don't think that in, um, my family there was a great deal of blame for that,' she manages. Was her mother's illness a shadow over her childhood? 'It wasn't really diagnosed till I was in my late teens,' she says, not answering the question. She pauses, then, to my surprise, goes on. 'I think my mother was a very eccentric woman anyway. Very fey. Not at all practical. So I don't think one was surprised by anything about her. Which of course included her tending to fall over and be clumsy. But she and my father didn't get along.' She gives an ominous gurgle. 'No, they didn't get along.' That wasn't the case in her own marriage? 'No.'  She and Don were quite calm, unlike her parents? 'No, I don't think I'm very calm.' She smiles. 'That's as much as I'm going to say to you about that! I don't think I've ever been calm!'  But was Don calm? 'Not particularly!'  I ask what happened when she left Don and had a breakdown. She looks startled. 'I? I never had a breakdown.' Didn't she say nine years ago she had had a breakdown? She looks amazed. 'Well, I feel we're always on the edge of disaster. For instance, a great friend of mine was suddenly struck down with bowel cancer on Friday and had an operation. But I don't think I was ever on the edge of a breakdown.' Did her husband's death make her think about her own? 'Oh, I think about death every day,' she replies. 'What it would be like, and why it would happen to me. I think we ought to think about it. I suppose that what I really think is that it would be' - she darts me a dry glance - 'humiliating to be afraid of it.' The photographer has arrived, and like the others before me, I have got no further with those unanswered questions - why she didn't have more children, what the crisis was in her marriage, what form the 'seething emotions' she refers to have taken. Like her books, she guards a central mystery. But it doesn't stop her being really rather fun. 'Well,' she remarks with a hint of conspiratorial amusement, heaving open the door to let me out, 'as you can probably imagine, I'm quite a connoisseur of interviews. And that one was almost enjoyable.'
