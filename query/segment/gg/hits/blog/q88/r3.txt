Local residents are up in arms, and even prepared to take the law into their own hands... Chief Inspector Wexford is not only concerned very personally with the effects of violence and prejudice, but is involved with a new programme to help the victims of domestic violence. His daughter, Sylvia, whose marriage is in difficulties, has also come to work nearby in a refuge for battered women. After those early disappearances, two far more serious crimes are committed which will affect the lives and attitudes of police and public alike.       First British Edition Hutchinson (1998)             A Sight for Sore Eyes    See  Review by Margaret Murphy   Lying in bed he thought about Francine as she had been, seated in front of his mirror, swathed in stiff silk, her reflected face looking gravely back at her real face. She must easily be the most beautiful girl in the world. A sight for sore eyes. Alfred Chance had once used that expression and it had stuck in his mind. About an object, though, not a person. It meant that looking at beauty took away pain and hurt and made you better. Francine made him better and his eyes were sore when they couldn't feast on her.� Neither his mother nor his father took much notice of Teddy Brex. No one ever cuddled him, or played with him or talked to him. The only person he could vaguely relate to was Alfred Chance, who lived next door, and made beautiful things in his workshop. People, Teddy suspected, were uniformly vile and rotten, vastly inferior to things. Objects never let you down. When Francine Hill was discovered by her father, sitting by the body of her mother, her skirt red with blood, she was mute. Not until nine months after the murder did she manage to speak, but she could not tell the police or her father anything to help track down the killer. Damaged children grow up in different ways. Some can shuffle off the horrors of the past, others perhaps cannot change who they are, or will never know how Teddy Brex became a handsome young man, Francine was beautiful. But it was death that brought them together�  'Ruth Rendell is the ultimate anatomist of the human psyche, probing behind public facades to reveal private torment and distorted visions that change the way we view the world around us' Val McDermid.      First British Edition Hutchinson (1997)             Road Rage    See  Review by Andrew Taylor - author of the highly acclaimed Roth & Lydmouth Series    See  Review by Val McDermid - Gold Dagger winner & creator of Lindsay Gordon, Kate Brannigan & Tony Hill  The 17th in the Chief Inspector Wexford Mysteries series and Ruth Rendell's 52nd title published to date. A by-pass is planned in Kingsmarkham; the building of such a road, particularly in such a hitherto unchanged rural environment, was certain to divide the local community. A protest group is formed, which Dora Wexford quickly joins. The Chief Inspector knows he must be more circumspect: trouble is expected. As the protesters begin to make their presence felt, the badly decomposed body of a young woman in unearthed. The Deputy Chief Constable is rapidly convinced of the murderer's identity but Wexford is uncertain. And as the case progresses, the protest escalates, and a number of people begin to disappear, including Dora Wexford�  'Ruth Rendell is one of those rare writers who genius makes you look at the world in a different way... When people talk sometimes of the poetry of which a novel may be capable, this above everything is what they mean: the ability to make the ordinary seem extraordinary' Allan Massie, Scotsman        First British Edition Hutchinson (1996)             The Keys to the Street    See  Review by Andrew Taylor - author of the highly acclaimed Roth & Lydmouth Series    See  Review by Val McDermid - Gold Dagger winner & creator of Lindsay Gordon, Kate Brannigan & Tony Hill  Mary Jago had donated her own bone marrow to save the life of someone she didn�t know. And this generous act led directly to the bitter break-up of her affair with Alistair. For him, it was as though her beauty had been plundered. But the man whose life she had saved would change Mary�s life in a way she could never have imagined. Located in the area around Regent�s Park, Ruth Rendell creates an atmospherically charged universe, where a young woman�s life is in danger both from the middle class world she knows and another world of the dispossessed and deranged. Mysterious, complex, dangerously inventive, Ruth Rendell�s new novel may well be her finest achievement.  'A masterpiece' A.N.Wilson 'Ruth Rendell is, unequivocally, the most brilliant mystery novelist of our time. Her stories are a lesson in a human nature as capable of the most exotic love as it is of the cruelest murder. She does not avert her gaze. Once again, she magnificently triumphs in a style that is uniquely hers and mesmerising' Patricia Cornwell            About The Author    Ruth Rendell has won many awards, including the Crime Writer's Association Gold Dagger for 1976's best crime novel with  A Demon in my View ; a second Edgar in 1984 from the Mystery Writers of America for the best short story,  The New Girl Friend ; a Gold Dagger award for  Live Flesh in 1986; and most recently she was the winner of the 1990 Sunday Times Literary award, as well as the Crime Writers' Association Cartier Diamond Dagger for outstanding contribution to the genre.
