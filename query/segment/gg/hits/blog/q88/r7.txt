 The Other World: Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine

      skip to main  |  skip to sidebar  The Other World   A blog about books, history, God and art, with occasional excursions into more worldly matters, like politics, clothes, and social observation. The title refers to the world of the mind and the imagination, as opposed to the material world before us. It's from Walter de la Mare's short story, "The Story of This Book," which forms the introduction to his anthology of poetry titled Come Hither.         Wednesday, July 11, 2007   Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine    Ruth  Rendell and Barbara Vine are the same person, as I think everyone knows who has ever heard of either. They/she writes novels of two kinds: Ruth  Rendell writes police  procedurals whose central character is an irascible detective named Reg  Wexford ; Barbara Vine writes psychological suspense thrillers, usually with a murder at their heart. The  Rendell /Vine distinction doesn't seem to be consistent. Some of the  Rendell books I have don't contain  Wexford , and are suspense rather than procedural novels, like  The Rottweiler (2003). To avoid confusion, I'm going to refer to her as  Rendell , but I don't intend to discuss the detective stories at all. It's a nuisance having to explain that, but without making it clear that this novelist writes two kinds of books, inconsistently published under two different names, it would be difficult for me to be sure that readers knew which author to look for. And for those who don't know her work,  Rendell's novels are very much worth reading. Reading  Rendell's novels is like finding yourself sitting on the bus beside someone who appears to be more or less normal, on the surface, but who begins to tell you about how he was abducted by aliens. In these novels, we are led through a maze of characters and events, some of them ordinary and others bizarre, wondering what the madman will do, or have done to him, before the end.  Rendell books in this category include the aforementioned  Rottweiler ,  The Killing Doll ,  Going Wrong ,  The Bridesmaid , and  A Sight for Sore Eyes . Many of these are set among vaguely pathetic people living in shabby suburbs in London; few of these people are dangerous, but many are deluded enough to let danger into their lives. In others the main characters are less pathetic and more prosperous, but make up for it by being thoroughly nasty and a menace to the people around them. She also writes another kind of suspense novel. These have a tone of Greek tragedy: something terrible has happened in the past, something that haunts the narrator (and this type of novel is often narrated in the first person or else told from the  POV of a single character) and that has warped his or her perspective on life ever since. The characters here tend to be somewhat more sympathetic than those in the first category: we get to know them better, and whatever they turn out to have done in the past, we find ourselves sympathizing with them. This category includes  A Dark-Adapted Eye ,  A Fatal Inversion , and  The House of Stairs . It's often said that the point of psychological suspense novels is to make the reader wonder " whydunnit ", instead of "who". Not in  Rendell's works. It's not usually  why we wonder about; that is being carefully explained to us as we go along. But - here's the point that makes her novels so different from many others of the same genre - we wonder  What happened? Or, in the ones whose crimes have yet to occur as the story begins,  What is about to happen? We know who, sort of, we can guess why quite easily, but we don't know what on earth the poor deluded lunatic is going to do. And of course, in most crime stories the crime has already occurred, or is just about to occur, as the novel opens, so this element is a less compelling concern. In  Going Wrong , the central figure is Guy, a young man in his mid-20s from the wrong side of the tracks. He is obsessed with his first teenage crush, a woman who half-encourages him to hang around and hope for more, although both are otherwise involved. He is clearly a rather disturbed young man, but he is not wholly egocentric and not vicious; while his ex-girlfriend is manipulating him to serve needs of her own, and her mother is a snobbish horror. Indeed, her snobbery is probably an element in Guy's obsession, as it helps to make his ex-girlfriend a symbol of something he has yet to achieve, although he is financially successful. In spite of Guy's folly you feel for him, and hope against hope that his better judgment will prevail and that he won't do anything truly  unforgivable . And he doesn't. Almost. Not quite. This is one of  Rendell's best in that its situations and characters are so entirely believable, and its odd ending of a kind that you sometimes read about in newspapers. Yet it is still exciting and painfully suspenseful, as you wait to see what Guy will do. I also very much enjoyed  House of Stairs , which is about a kind of commune established more or less ad  hoc , but deliberately (if that makes any sense), by a lonely middle-aged widow who is desperate to have a man in her life again. The narrator - who is her cousin by marriage - is a much younger woman terrified that she may develop the Huntington's chorea that killed her own mother. Their fond and close relationship had been abruptly ended long before by some terrible tragedy which gradually reveals itself as the novel goes on. Part of the attraction of the book is the picture of a very believable 1960s  hippy Bohemia, which is shown to be full of freeloaders and poseurs, but still has the charm of hope and youth to enliven it, until the snake enters the garden of Eden. Another of  Rendell's less well-known books is  No Night Is Too Long , a tragic and not altogether believable love story. It's narrated (mainly) by Tim, an apprentice writer who happens to be singularly good-looking and rather weak-willed. He is equally attractive to men and to women, although not quite clear on which he prefers himself. He has done something terrible to a man with whom he was once in love; he is now full of remorse, and attempting to write an account of what happened. (There is a TV version of this novel; it isn't very good, mostly because it alters the ending considerably, out of what I think is some form of moral correctness.) Stories about obsessive love are nearly always narrated by, or told from the point of view of, the lover. This is one of the few narrated by the beloved, the obscure object of desire, who is by turns bewildered and disgusted by the reaction he awakens in other people, and is often embarrassed by it: Once, when I'd  been at home with flu in the Christmas vacation and had nothing to read, I'd had to fall back on some novels of Somerset Maugham that had been my grandmother's.  Ivo [his lover] had grown more and more like one of those characters in his books who are always groaning about their miserable fate in helplessly loving someone unworthy of their love. Maugham never says much about what that's like for the poor old unworthy object. I could have told him. It's not exactly uplifting for the self-image. Although  Rendell doesn't say so directly, it seems to be Tim's sexual attractiveness that makes him so unsure of his own sexual orientation. He is, at the start of his account of himself, too weak to know what he wants: he seeks out other people's admiration and desire in order to warm himself at their fire, as it were. It's this tendency or habit that leads to his downfall; it's finding a way out of this, learning by his mistakes, that begins to make him human. Rendell really has only two faults as a writer. One is her tendency to search far and wide for extraordinary situations and people with which to startle her readers. (One of her books is about a group of people who make a way of life out of living on rooftops, climbing from one to another.) And while I'm sure some of these at least are based on fact, that doesn't always make the situations described more believable. The other fault I've noticed is something I call "too many  McGuffins ". I don't think I'd say that of any other novelist I've read; it seems to be something peculiar to  Rendell . It  consists of including so many plot-markers and plot-drivers that you hardly know which to take special note of. In  House of Stairs , there is a painting, a bloodstone ring, a novel by Henry James, and of course, the narrator's Huntington's disease, all of which have a sort of iconic importance to the action, driving the characters forward. These are relatively minor faults, though, in a novelist whose work is so varied and, at its best, so sharply observant of human beings and our awfulness, yet still somehow manages to show the pathos in the worst human beings without ever descending into sentimentality.

Thank you, now I know what to look for when I return my current library loot (Rex Stout, rare edition "Nero Wolf Omnibus"'36). Unfortunately, I have exausted their supply of Ngaio Marsh and started to panic - how to fill my commutes?    Thursday, July 12, 2007             Roberta said...  I was delighted to read your comments on one of my favorite writers. I just presented a lecture/discussion on A JUDGEMENT IN STONE at the Hanover Public Library in Hanover, PA. I'm getting ready to retire from my work as an information specialist at a busy public library in MD, & one of the first things I'm going to do is read some of the Rendell/Vine novels I haven't had time to get to yet. Probably I'll read HOUSE OF STAIRS first. Thanks again for your insightful comments on this great author.    Tuesday, July 17, 2007                Alias Clio said...  I'm glad I was able to say something useful. I checked out your website, and thought your own writing about Rendell was so good that I put you on my links list.  And you've given me some new ideas about what to read, too.    Wednesday, July 18, 2007             Anonymous said...  Curiosity got the better of me when I stumbled on to this blog ...but very satisfying to see your insight into the works of one of my favourite authors. Her books can really send a chill up your spine, not because of the gruesome crimes committed by a 'villain'...the characters in her book are everyday, common people....they could any one you meet; far from fantastic. Yet, the reader is introduced to the workings of subtle, warped minds. The people are completely 'real' too! The reader gets to know them as persons so very well ...and that makes her stories as believable as first hand experiences!    Monday, July 30, 2007                Thursday said...  I've never read anything by Rendell, but I just watched Claude Chabrol's film version of A Judgment in Stone (La Ceremonie), and was wondering if you had seen it. I don't think its a great film, but its a good one and Isabelle Huppert gives yet another great performance as a total nutter.  I think you might also be interested in some of Chabrol's other films. He tends to specialize in bad girls. His best film is Story of Women, also with Huppert, but you might also be interested in Les Bonnes Femmes. Its the story of 4 shop girls in 60s France. The title is entirely ironic. Its a bit of a mess, but its still a very intersting mess.    Wednesday, October 24, 2007             Anonymous said...  Well, Thursday, I'll have a look sometime and see what I think. I have to try to get into the habit of buying movies online, since French films are surprisingly hard to find in Ottawa shops.
