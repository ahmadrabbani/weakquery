 Talking to Strange Men (Ruth Rendell) - book review

Talking to Strange Men ranks with  Asta's Book as one of my favourites. Though it has some mystery elements, it is more a psychological novel than a detective story, with obsession in various forms as a theme: the sexual obsessions of adults; the obsession children bring to their games; even the oddity of a man obsessed with a pet myna bird.  There are two strands to the plot: in one rival groups of school children are playing an involved game of espionage; in the other an abandoned husband is struggling to rebuild his life. When the two intersect — when one of the adults starts modifying the childrens' secret messages — things come to a climax for two of the characters. Though this may sound a bit fanciful, the plot is actually quite credible and the psychological portrayal of the central characters is completely convincing. As a result  Talking to Strange Men is free from the feeling of contrivance that spoils some of Rendell's novels.
