                      Gas your Body Makes </b><br>
                      Though most people produce about 10 liters of gas each day, 
                      most of this gas is reabsorbed through the bowel wall and 
                      doesn't see the light of day. </font> 
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b>The 
                      Air You Swallow </b><br>
                      People swallow some air while eating, drinking, chewing 
                      gum, and even talking.&nbsp; We usually don't even realize 
                      we've swallowed air.&nbsp; The most common ways air enters 
                      you gut is when you gulp down food, have carbonated drinks 
                      (e.g., soda and seltzer), or chew with your mouth open.&nbsp; 
                      Sometimes, swallowing air can be a nervous habit.</font> 
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Usually, 
                      swallowed air will inflate your stomach and make you uncomfortable.&nbsp; 
                      A belch or burp will usually relieve this feeling.&nbsp; 
                      If this air is not belched or burped back out, it will eventually 
                      pass into the lower part of the gut.&nbsp; Some of it will 
                      be absorbed by your gut, and some will be passed down and 
                      through your anus as flatulence.&nbsp; In the meantime, 
                      you will feel bloated and uncomfortable.</font> 
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Gas-producing 
                      bacteria</b> <br>
                      "Friendly" bacteria normally live in your gut and aid in 
                      some digestive processes. If you remember from the previous 
                      section, they also compose a large part of your stool.&nbsp; 
                      These bacteria break down carbohydrates found in some foods 
                      like beans, legumes, and certain fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; 
                      A by-product of this process is gas, specifically methane, 
                      which is released through your rectum.&nbsp; Methane, like 
                      propane, is a highly flammable gas.&nbsp; You may have once 
                      known (or even been) one of those people who liked to light 
                      their farts on fire.&nbsp; It is the high concentration 
                      of methane that allows this spectacular sight (though there 
                      is a real risk of catching your clothes or pubic hair on 
                      fire, so don't try it).</font> 
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Other 
                      common causes of excess gas in certain people include the 
                      sugars, LACTOSE (found in milk and dairy products),&nbsp; 
                      FRUCTOSE (found in fruit and which is used to sweeten other 
                      foods), SORBITOL and MANNITOL (used as artificial sweeteners).</font> 
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b>I 
                      think certain foods give me gas. What do I do?<br>
                      </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">No 
                      two bodies are exactly alike - the foods that give you gas 
                      may leave your friends in peace.&nbsp; Also, two servings 
                      of a specific food may cause gas (such as diary due to lactose 
                      intolerance), whereas a half-serving may not.&nbsp; A good 
                      way to determine what foods are increasing your gas level 
                      is by keeping a food diary.&nbsp; Write down exactly what 
                      you had to eat during each meal, and when gas occurred. 
                      You should soon be able to identify the culprits. Eliminate 
                      one food at a time, so you can be sure it's that particular 
                      food.&nbsp; After you're sure a certain food causes gas, 
                      play around with the amount of that food you eat. You may 
                      be able to eat a certain amount of it without suffering 
                      from gas.</font> 
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Another 
                      solution are over-the-counter medications that contain enzymes 
                      to help break down the underlying cause in some cases of 
                      increased flatulence.&nbsp; A common cause of bloating and 
                      increased gas, lactose intolerance, occurs when your gut 
                      is unable to break down lactose (a sugar found in milk and 
                      diary products).&nbsp; Lactase is an enzyme that breaks 
                      lactose into smaller sugars that the body can then digest 
                      without producing as much gas.&nbsp; Lactase can be purchased 
                      in pill form and can be taken whenever eating a meal that 
                      contains diary products.&nbsp; Likewise, Lactaid milk contains 
                      lactase and hence has a much decreased content of lactose.</font> 
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Another 
                      common cause of gas are the carbohydrates (e.g., a form 
                      of sugar) found in beans.&nbsp; The over-the-counter medication, 
                      Beanco, contains an enzyme that breaks down gas-causing 
                      carbohydrates.&nbsp; Adding a few drops to your first spoonful 
                      of bean-containing food can prevent the problem.&nbsp; These 
                      medications are found in the antacid section of your local 
                      pharmacy.</font> 
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Another 
                      common cause of gas is due to the ingestion of a high sugar 
                      load.&nbsp; Even if your body is normally able to digest 
                      sugars, if you take a large amount at one time (e.g., too 
                      much hard candy at Halloween, a whole pack of gum at one 
                      sitting, etc.), the sugars pass through your small intestine 
                      without being sufficiently absorbed.&nbsp; The bacteria 
                      in your gut then essentially are overfeed, producing a lot 
                      of gas.</font> 
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Regular 
                      exercise may also help reduce flatulence.<br>
                      </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">If 
                      you have kept a food log, and it seems that food is not 
                      the cause of your gas, chances are your problem is from 
                      swallowed air.&nbsp; Do you belch or burp often as well 
                      as pass gas?&nbsp; Pay attention to how you actually eat.&nbsp; 
                      Chew with your mouth closed, and try to talk less while 
                      you eat. This will help reduce the air you swallow during 
                      meals.&nbsp; Cut down on carbonated drinks which contain 
                      quite a bit of carbon dioxide (as well as a lot of sugar).</font> 
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Lastly, 
                      if you're already in agony, an over-the-counter drug containing 
                      simethicone (Gas-X, Mylicon, etc.) can bring great relief 
                      by reducing troublesome trapped gas. These products usually 
                      work within a short period of time.</font> 
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">If 
                      you find, however, that none of the above sufficiently treats 
                      your problem, or if you ever have serious abdominal pain, 
                      you should alert your family physician.&nbsp; You might 
                      have a serious medical condition that needs to be diagnosed 
                      and treated.</font> 
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Why 
                      does the gas I pass smell the way it does?<br>
                      </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Again, 
                      you are what you eat, and so is the gas you pass.&nbsp; 
                      As noted, in addition to methane, your gas contains sulfur.&nbsp; 
                      Sulfur is a common byproduct of the bacterial metabolization 
                      of food, and this stinks like rotten eggs.&nbsp; In addition, 
                      very small particles of feces are aerosolized in the gas 
                      you pass.</font> 
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">If 
                      your flatulence smells particularly bad, please see the 
                      section on stool.&nbsp; Are your stools greasy, bulky and 
                      prone to floating?&nbsp; You may have problems digesting 
                      or absorbing fats, and should seek medical attention if 
                      this persists.</font>
