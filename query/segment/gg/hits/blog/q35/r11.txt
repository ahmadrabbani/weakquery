BRODY So you think that you cannot consume milk or other foods that contain lactose. Think again. New studies show that even people with a laboratory-confirmed intolerance to lactose can consume ordinary dairy foods, which are the best source of the nutrients needed to prevent osteoporosis.  There are also some surprises for lactose-intolerant people who switched from milk to yogurt as their primary source of calcium. Not all yogurts are the same, and even those that state they contain "active yogurt cultures" may not be readily digested by some people with lactose intolerance.     The Problem People cannot absorb dietary lactose intact. It must first be split by the digestive enzyme lactase into its component sugars, glucose and galactose, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestine. When undigested lactose reaches the large intestine, it attracts fluids and is attacked by gas-producing bacteria, resulting in one or more symptoms of lactose intolerance: abdominal bloating, flatus, fatty stools and diarrhea.  Lactose intolerance is not the same as a milk allergy, which occurs in fewer than 1 percent of adults. Allergy symptoms range from runny noses to diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, asthma, dermatitis and hives.  Lactose intolerance results from a deficiency of lactase. Recognition of the symptoms caused by this deficiency has prompted millions of people to avoid milk and other dairy products. Many others who chose to continue consuming these foods have turned to new and more costly digestive aids, including lactose-reduced milk, cottage cheese and ice cream, enzyme drops that can be added to liquid dairy products at home and enzyme tablets that can be taken when dairy and other lactose-containing products are consumed.  In cases of severe lactose intolerance, consumption of a significant quantity of a food rich in lactose, including those made with whey, can cause distressing symptoms. But the new studies suggest that lactose intolerance is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon. Rather, many people with lactose deficiency can continue to consume moderate amounts of milk and other dairy products without experiencing symptoms and without having to use or take any special products. Furthermore, researchers have found that if people with the enzyme deficiency regularly consume moderate amounts of lactose, their bodies adapt and they experience none of the classic symptoms.  The studies also indicate that a significant percentage of people who think they are lactose intolerant are really not. While they do indeed develop symptoms similar to those caused by the enzyme deficiency, the reason for their symptoms is not a lack of lactase.     Who Has It? Nearly everyone is born with the ability to produce lactase, which enables infants to digest the large amount of lactose in breast milk. But at some time during childhood, lactase production slackens in most people. For some, this decline can reach very low levels by the middle teen-age years or young adulthood.  In about 30 percent of people worldwide, especially those from Northern Europe and some parts of Africa and the Middle East, a genetic mutation arose long ago that resulted in lifelong production of lactase in amounts comparable to the large amounts of early childhood. When an individual with this gene has children with someone who lacks the mutated gene -- for example, a person of Asian, African or Eastern European descent -- half of the children are likely to develop lactose intolerance as adults. Currently, about 1 in 4 American adults cannot properly digest and absorb lactose.  There are several ways to test for lactose intolerance. The simplest and cheapest can be done at home. After a day of avoiding all foods that contain lactose, first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, consume a quart of nonfat milk within two hours. If symptoms develop before you drink the entire quart, stop. This test, however, has limitations, since it lacks an objective measurement of an inability to digest lactose. Rather than being caused by lactose, the symptoms may be psychologically induced. More accurate tests, done over the course of several hours in a medical setting, involve measuring the amount of hydrogen in the breath or glucose in the blood after the person consumes a solution of lactose in water.  In a test by Dr. Michael D. Levitt and colleagues at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis, of 30 people who described themselves as severely lactose intolerant, 9 were found to have no problem with lactose digestion.  In another study published this month in The American Journal for Clinical Nutrition, Dr. Levitt's group could document lactase deficiency in only 34 of 49 men and women who said they experienced symptoms after consuming one cup of milk. Nineteen of those 34 were tested further. Twice a day they were given one cup of either lactose-reduced milk or regular milk to drink, but they reported no greater incidence of symptoms after consuming the regular milk.  The researchers concluded that most people with lactase deficiency tolerated two cups of milk per day "without appreciable symptoms" and that some people who thought they were severely lactose intolerant developed intestinal gas for other reasons.     Living With the Condition Lactose intolerance is dose-dependent. While you may be able to consume half a glass of milk on an empty stomach without developing symptoms, two glasses scould make you very uncomfortable. Milk consumed at the end of a meal or along with other foods, especially fiber-rich foods like a whole-grain cereal, is likely to be more readily digested.  The type of dairy product makes a difference, as well. Hard cheeses, Camembert and brie contain little or no lactose, but buttermilk has as much lactose as milk. Ice cream and cottage cheese have a little less.  Yogurt, too, is fairly rich in lactose but with an important difference. The bacterial cultures used to produce yogurt digest some of the lactose in the process. And if the yogurt is not reheated after it is produced, these bacteria will stay alive and assist your digestive process. Yogurt brands certified as containing "live and active cultures" by the National Yogurt Association will say so on the label. They include Dannon, Yoplait-Columbo, Haagen Dazs, Kraft and several store brands. Some that say they contain active cultures may have been reheated after the yogurt was made. Frozen yogurt, on the other hand, is repasteurized and may cause symptoms when consumed by those with a severe lactose intolerance.  If any amount of lactose causes problems, try the lactose-reduced dairy products now widely available in groceries. Or add the enzyme to any liquid milk product and let it stand in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Lactase tablets taken with any food containing lactose may also help. Both products are sold in pharmacies and health-food stores.
