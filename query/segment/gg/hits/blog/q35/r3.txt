 Gas (Flatus)

                GAS (FLATUS)     There are three major sources of gas in your gut:   gas your body makes  air you swallow  gas made by the "friendly" bacteria normally found in your gut.     The Gas your Body Makes  Though most people produce about 10 liters of gas each day, most of this gas is reabsorbed through the bowel wall and doesn't see the light of day.    The Air You Swallow  People swallow some air while eating, drinking, chewing gum, and even talking.  We usually don't even realize we've swallowed air.  The most common ways air enters you gut is when you gulp down food, have carbonated drinks (e.g., soda and seltzer), or chew with your mouth open.  Sometimes, swallowing air can be a nervous habit.  Usually, swallowed air will inflate your stomach and make you uncomfortable.  A belch or burp will usually relieve this feeling.  If this air is not belched or burped back out, it will eventually pass into the lower part of the gut.  Some of it will be absorbed by your gut, and some will be passed down and through your anus as flatulence.  In the meantime, you will feel bloated and uncomfortable.   Gas-producing bacteria "Friendly" bacteria normally live in your gut and aid in some digestive processes. If you remember from the previous section, they also compose a large part of your stool.  These bacteria break down carbohydrates found in some foods like beans, legumes, and certain fruits and vegetables.  A by-product of this process is gas, specifically methane, which is released through your rectum.  Methane, like propane, is a highly flammable gas.  You may have once known (or even been) one of those people who liked to light their farts on fire.  It is the high concentration of methane that allows this spectacular sight (though there is a real risk of catching your clothes or pubic hair on fire, so don't try it).  Other common causes of excess gas in certain people include the sugars, LACTOSE (found in milk and dairy products),  FRUCTOSE (found in fruit and which is used to sweeten other foods), SORBITOL and MANNITOL (used as artificial sweeteners).   I think certain foods give me gas. What do I do?    No two bodies are exactly alike - the foods that give you gas may leave your friends in peace.  Also, two servings of a specific food may cause gas (such as diary due to lactose intolerance), whereas a half-serving may not.  A good way to determine what foods are increasing your gas level is by keeping a food diary.  Write down exactly what you had to eat during each meal, and when gas occurred. You should soon be able to identify the culprits. Eliminate one food at a time, so you can be sure it's that particular food.  After you're sure a certain food causes gas, play around with the amount of that food you eat. You may be able to eat a certain amount of it without suffering from gas.  Another solution are over-the-counter medications that contain enzymes to help break down the underlying cause in some cases of increased flatulence.  A common cause of bloating and increased gas, lactose intolerance, occurs when your gut is unable to break down lactose (a sugar found in milk and diary products).  Lactase is an enzyme that breaks lactose into smaller sugars that the body can then digest without producing as much gas.  Lactase can be purchased in pill form and can be taken whenever eating a meal that contains diary products.  Likewise, Lactaid milk contains lactase and hence has a much decreased content of lactose.  Another common cause of gas are the carbohydrates (e.g., a form of sugar) found in beans.  The over-the-counter medication, Beanco, contains an enzyme that breaks down gas-causing carbohydrates.  Adding a few drops to your first spoonful of bean-containing food can prevent the problem.  These medications are found in the antacid section of your local pharmacy.  Another common cause of gas is due to the ingestion of a high sugar load.  Even if your body is normally able to digest sugars, if you take a large amount at one time (e.g., too much hard candy at Halloween, a whole pack of gum at one sitting, etc.), the sugars pass through your small intestine without being sufficiently absorbed.  The bacteria in your gut then essentially are overfeed, producing a lot of gas.   Regular exercise may also help reduce flatulence.    If you have kept a food log, and it seems that food is not the cause of your gas, chances are your problem is from swallowed air.  Do you belch or burp often as well as pass gas?  Pay attention to how you actually eat.  Chew with your mouth closed, and try to talk less while you eat. This will help reduce the air you swallow during meals.  Cut down on carbonated drinks which contain quite a bit of carbon dioxide (as well as a lot of sugar).  Lastly, if you're already in agony, an over-the-counter drug containing simethicone (Gas-X, Mylicon, etc.) can bring great relief by reducing troublesome trapped gas. These products usually work within a short period of time.  If you find, however, that none of the above sufficiently treats your problem, or if you ever have serious abdominal pain, you should alert your family physician.  You might have a serious medical condition that needs to be diagnosed and treated.   Why does the gas I pass smell the way it does?    Again, you are what you eat, and so is the gas you pass.  As noted, in addition to methane, your gas contains sulfur.  Sulfur is a common byproduct of the bacterial metabolization of food, and this stinks like rotten eggs.  In addition, very small particles of feces are aerosolized in the gas you pass.  If your flatulence smells particularly bad, please see the section on stool.  Are your stools greasy, bulky and prone to floating?  You may have problems digesting or absorbing fats, and should seek medical attention if this persists.                             Email this page to a friend                     Copyright © 1996 - 2002      Medical Disclaimer
