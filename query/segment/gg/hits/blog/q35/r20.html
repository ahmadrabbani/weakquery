<br />
i think I might be lactose intolerant (more than the normal amount)... or it could just be beer shits?<br />
<br />
how do you test if you are lactose intolerant? drink a ton of milk and see what happens?<br />
<br />
if you ate two pieces of pizza and were really lactose intolerant, how long would the cheese take to cause an effect?</div></div><hr />

GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!!!<br />
No seriously, there are few things I love more than a small donut and large milk. My life is not complete without it.</div></div><hr />

No, no bathroom run but get gas, lots of gas. But if you drink milk everyday, the symptom will go away--after a month.</div></div><hr />

I'm Sicialian and could no longer stomache milk around the age of 28.  It went from gas to OMG!  I need a toilet and fast!<br />
<br />
<br />
I can still eat small amounts of cheese without issue but milk &amp; ice cream is the worst and have not had a glass of milk for the past 10yrs or so and swore off ice cream about 5yrs back.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is - milk is totally unappetizing now as my brain says yuck!</div></div><hr />

(and I'm now 37)  I wasn't  before.... Go figure!  Been using this awesome product for about 10 years now. <br />

 Much more convenient than LactAid.  Which also works.   (If you want to use LactAid, ignore the instructions.  Just take 1/2 a tablet every 5-10 minutes while you're eating stuff with lactose.  Begin and end with 1/2 a pill.  <br />
<br />
I'd say I'm moderate/severely lactose intolerant.  I ate ONE (real) chocolate chip and I could feel it.   No gas or toilet, but just a tiny bit of upset stomach.  If I were to eat pizza/ice cream without it, I'd feel the effects in about 10 minutes and be on the can for about 20/30 mins.   Not fun.  I was extremely miserable until I found out what the problem was.   (Right when they started marketing LactAid)</div></div><hr />

Soy milk is actually not such a bad thing. Soy is supposedly good for prostrate. I like vanilla soy mild myself but haven't had it for some time now that I think about it. In fact thinking about it a little more, I used to make oatmeal in the AM with vanilla soy milk. It needed no extra sugar ... its not sweet, but for cutting back on calories ... it was pretty good.</div></div><hr />

Yup majority of the world is lactose intolerant in some degree. People who are mainly of European decent have less intolerance than any other peoples.</div></div><hr />

I just ate a big bowl of ice cream. My wife will love me tonight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can consume cheese fine though.  guessing that lactose gets broken down in the cheese making process.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Apparently, Jews, blacks, asian, and American indians have high rates of lactose intolerance.<br />
 <br />
If you're in one of those groups there's a decent probablity that's what you have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You continue to produce some of the enzyme that digests lactose typically, but it's hard to judge what the tipping point is, took me years to figure out I was intolerant, I'm a bit of an anomaly as I'm a Euro mutt genetically.</div></div><hr />

Nothing like a bag of milk after a night of drinking.</div></div><hr />
