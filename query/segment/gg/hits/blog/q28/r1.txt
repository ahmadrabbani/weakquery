It was produced/written by Sorkin (for the first four seasons) and also produced by Thomas Schlamme. After season four it was produced by John Wells. The series is set in the West Wing of the White House, the location of the Oval Office and offices of presidential senior staff, during the fictional Democratic administration of Josiah Bartlet (played by Martin Sheen). The West Wing was produced by Warner Bros. Television. It first aired on NBC in 1999, and has been broadcast by many networks in dozens of other countries. The series ended its seven-year run on May 14, 2006.[1][broken citation] The West Wing dvd received positive reviews from critics, political science professors, and former White House staffers. In total, The West Wing won two Golden Globe Awards and 26 Emmy Awards, a tie with Hill Street Blues for the most Emmy Awards ever won by a television drama series. Included in this record-equalling haul were four straight awards for Outstanding Drama Series (2000–2003).[2] The show's ratings waned in later years, after series creator Aaron Sorkin (who wrote or co-wrote 85 of the first 88 episodes) left the show after the fourth season, yet it remained popular among high-income viewers, a key demographic for the show and its advertisers. more about  The West Wing dvd , please visit :  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing_(television)      The West Wing Complete Series DVD Box Set   is   in stock , Please add to the cart , our system will estimate the shipping by your location .
