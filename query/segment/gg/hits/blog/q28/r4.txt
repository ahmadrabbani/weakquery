BOUDETTE  WASHINGTON -- Inside a windowless, ornate room Thursday just across from the Oval Office, President Barack Obama and a group of senior economic advisers began the job of remaking the American automobile industry. The first order of business: Oust  General Motors Corp. Chief Executive Rick Wagoner. It "wasn't the hardest decision," said one government official.  Bloomberg News Obama car adviser Steven Rattner    Steven Rattner, a former investment banker who is heading the administration's auto restructuring; chief economic adviser Lawrence Summers; and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner were among those gathered around the polished wood table of the Roosevelt Room in the White House's West Wing. They were there to decide under what conditions the government would continue to prop up once-powerful Detroit car companies GM and Chrysler LLC. In the post-World War II boom, they were at the pinnacle of a quintessentially American industry. At Thursday's meeting, once the Obama administration concluded the pair were running out of money, their effective dismantling began. Beyond seeking Mr. Wagoner's resignation, the officials also gave failing grades to GM and Chrysler for the restructuring plans they submitted to the government Feb. 17. They also set a deadline -- one month for Chrysler, two months for GM -- after which the government might force a bankruptcy restructuring of both companies and break up two of America's business icons. Many of GM's problems didn't start during Mr. Wagoner's term, and most predate the economic downturn that sent car sales slumping, such as union contracts and the costs of paying for retiree health care. GM made a bad situation worse with huge bets on trucks and SUVs that piled up on dealer lots amid soaring gas prices last year. Interviews with government officials and others familiar with the matter show Mr. Wagoner scrambling to build support for GM across the globe, but unable to overcome the fact that he was at the helm during the company's deepest slide. On March 16, Mr. Wagoner and GM's chief operating officer, Frederick "Fritz" Henderson, were in Washington trying to make the case that they should receive more government aid. GM had already received $17.4 billion in loans. Enlarge Image      Close     Getty Images Former General Motors chief Rick Wagoner, seen last month discussing his plan to keep GM viable, was asked to step down by the Obama administration as part of government efforts to prop up the company.    At the German embassy, the two men discussed the plight of Opel, the core of GM's European unit, with the German economics minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg. The following day, they were back at the Treasury, trying to make the case that GM's recovery plan would work. Late in the afternoon, the two executives hurried to the airport and boarded a Northwest flight bound for Detroit. It was a far cry from the days when they flew the corporate jets GM operated out of its own small terminal at the Detroit airport. They settled into the last row in first class, Mr. Henderson taking the window and Mr. Wagoner the aisle. As the Airbus 319 lifted off, Mr. Henderson occupied himself with the day's newspaper, Mr. Wagoner with reports. The two men said little to each other throughout the one-hour-and-36-minute flight. When the plane touched down, they left the plane, and with little more than a wave to his COO, Mr. Wagoner walked off with his security guard. At the curb, Mr. Wagoner climbed into a black Cadillac Escalade SUV and rode off. The White House meeting at which Mr. Wagoner's fate was decided came five days before a March 31 deadline when the administration was set to rule on the viability of the companies. The auto team prepared briefs for Mr. Obama on his options, as well as viability reports on both companies. The car team wanted an executive who could accelerate the changes it desired. Mr. Wagoner didn't have any support within the group. "This is Obama, and symbols of change are important," said one person familiar with the situation. More   Page One: U.S. Considers Bankruptcy for GM, Chrysler     Detroit in Crisis: News, analysis and more      A much harder decision was what to do with Chrysler. A conclusion that the company wasn't viable could lead to 40,000 workers losing their jobs. To combat that threat, the government is negotiating with Chrysler and Italian car maker Fiat SpA for an agreement that Fiat will continue to make cars in the U.S. if it buys Chrysler, according to an official of the Obama administration. After the Thursday meeting at the White House, Mr. Rattner asked Mr. Wagoner and Mr. Henderson to come see him the next day. Mr. Rattner broke the news to Mr. Wagoner at his office at the Treasury, according to an administration official. Afterward, Mr. Rattner met with Mr. Henderson, and told him he would take over as GM's CEO. "On Friday I was in Washington for a meeting with administration officials," Mr. Wagoner said in a statement released by GM early Monday morning. "In the course of that meeting, they requested that I 'step aside' as CEO of GM, and so I have." Once word started to trickle out that a White House decision on the auto makers' fate was imminent, GM officials and some Michigan lawmakers began making calls. Michigan's Democratic governor, Jennifer Granholm, called the White House to ask for a meeting with Mr. Obama. Told she'd need to come in by Friday, which wasn't possible, she had a personal phone call with the president and urged him to consider the communities that could suffer. Mr. Wagoner told GM's board Friday evening that he was asked to step down and informed directors the administration wanted a majority of them to resign, according to two GM officials. Several volunteered to quit over the weekend. Other GM officials speculated that they would also be asked to resign. Also expected to be on the chopping block is GM's Washington office, where the company's in-house lobbyists work. On Sunday, the Obama administration lined up conference calls with key lawmakers. Mr. Obama made one call himself to some of the Michigan delegation, including U.S. Sen. Carl Levin and his brother, Rep. Sander Levin, and Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow. He told them that he planned to put some administration staff into the Detroit companies, according to one person familiar with the situation. White House economic adviser Mr. Summers led a conference call at 8:30 p.m. Sunday with lawmakers who had expressed strong interest in the auto bailout. At one point during the call, Mr. Summers told lawmakers the administration was pushing for the Fiat-Chrysler deal to include "building an energy-efficient vehicle in this country," Sen. Bob Corker said. Sen. Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said he told Mr. Rattner on Monday that he was alarmed that the administration would dictate what kind of vehicles would be constructed. "Deciding what vehicles and plants will survive is setting industrial policy," the senator said. Others, who depend on GM and Chrysler emerging healthy from this process, are more positive. Michael J. Jackson, chief executive of car retailer  AutoNation Inc., praised the task force Monday for taking bold steps. "I think they nailed it," he said.
