 Jason Bateman Calls 'Arrested Development' Movie Plot 'Incredible' - MTV Movie News| MTV 

        Mar 8 2011 10:17 PM EST  29,060  Jason Bateman Calls 'Arrested Development' Movie Plot 'Incredible' 'It's everything you would want it to be and more,' actor tells MTV News. By Eric Ditzian (@ericditzian)    , with reporting by Josh Horowitz (@joshuahorowitz)          Despite  David Cross' hilariously pessimistic outlook on the possibility of an "Arrested Development" movie, exec producer  Ron Howard wasn't kidding when he told MTV News that an adaptation of the TV series is "a real priority" for creator Mitch Hurwitz.     How do we know? Well, aside from just really, really hoping he wasn't kidding, Jason Bateman recently tossed us some info that indicates Hurwitz is very much plowing forward with a script — five years after the show's cancellation.  "For the very first time, [Hurwitz] sat me down last week to talk about what he's got and where he's going and what do I think," Bateman told us while promoting his upcoming comedy "Paul." "As a fan of the show, I was vibrating with excitement that he was pulling me behind the curtain."  Mind you, Bateman still hasn't seen a single page of a script, but the mere fact that he had a meeting about the project was enough to encourage the actor that, at long last, an "Arrested" movie will actually become a reality.  "I can confirm what his update was, which was that he is very deep into the work on it," Bateman said. "The odds of him getting it done before the end of the year, as he says he wants to, are good."  So, um, what did Hurwitz actually dish about the story line? Bateman didn't let any details slip out other than to say the concept is "incredible." "It's everything you would want it to be and more," he added. "I really hope he finishes soon so we have a shot at doing it before the end of the year."  Check out everything we've got on  "Paul."
