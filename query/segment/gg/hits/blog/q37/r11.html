<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">INTRODUCTION</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The Black Disciples (BDs) are the Chicago "folks" gang that gained international notoriety
in 1994 by executing its eleven-year-old member "Yummy".  It is also unique in its comparison with
another African-American gang, the Gangster Disciples (GDs).  While the GDs are structured like
a corporate enterprise, the BDs are structured more like a religion where gang leaders are called
"ministers".<span style="font-weight: bold">  </span>The BDs trace their historical roots directly to "King David Barksdale".  In other
respects, the BDs are like many other American gangs in that this type of gang is able to exist over
time only by the criminal exploitation of children.<span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">THE BDs ARISING FROM A SPLINTERING EFFECT IN A LARGER GANG</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The GDs, BGs, and BDs all became separate gang entities through splintering from the Black
Gangster Disciples.  It all began with "King David", chief of the Devils Disciples.  When King David
died in 1974, the new umbrella organization was the Black Gangster Disciples (BGDs).  However,
in 1978 three groups splintered off from the BGDs all having their origins from the original Devils
Disciples (BGs, GDs, and BDs).  The splintering was due to the individual leaders.  This profile of
the BD's shows that even within the BD's a splintering has occurred.  This gang phenomenon has
also been seen in "people" or "brothers" gangs, like the Latin Kings, where the East Coast version
of the Latin Kings has a completely different written constitution than that found in the original
Chicago version of the gang.  Given the natural way in which this splintering phenomenon occurs
in gangs, it is theoretically possible to induce the same effect by the separation and promotion of
leadership skills.  We are not implying this should be done in the form of social engineering, but
rather that conflict among gang leaders in the same gang also occurs naturally and predictably. 
However, rather than allowing the gang to "settle" its internal disputes, in a correctional setting it
may be worthwhile to transfer out one of the members along with some of his most earnest
supporters.  This could potentially create a "schism", unresolved conflict in the leadership structure
of the gang, and therefore provide the basis for a splintering effect.  The theory that a smaller
decentralized gang would be more "manageable" would be the basis for viewing the splintering
effect as a positive development from a gang control strategy viewpoint.<span style="font-weight: bold">  </span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>As of this writing, there may be as many as 300 "sets" of the BDs throughout the Chicagoland
area.  Each "set" typically has 30 to 40 members, and is identical in the format of its organizational
structure.  Each "set" is actually called a "dynasty" in the language of the BDs, and refers to a
specific section of the BD organization.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In each set or dynasty of the BDs, the lowest ranking members are soldiers or representatives. 
The permanent leadership ranks include: Minister, Assistant Co-Minister, and the Demetrius.  One
rank above the ordinary members is the "First Demetrius".  One rank above the First Demetrius is
the "Assistant Co-Minister".  Above this in each set is the "Minister".  All sets revere "King David"
at the head of their organization, even though "King David" is dead.  The living top boss of this mob
is "King Shorty", also known as the "crowned king" (Jerome Freeman).</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Each set or dynast y also has the following temporary positions of rank that exist underneath
the First Demetrius: (1) Chief of Violations, (2) Chief of Security, and (3) Assistant Chief of
Security.  These positions may rotate periodically, because the labor is basically unrewarded (the
responsibility outweighs the authority and economic benefits).</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Overall each set, chapter, or "dynasty" as the BDs call it is a middle management leadership
structure that is comparable to the BG's gang.  There are several generals or "dons", each of which
may have "deputies".  It is through this middle management leadership that money passes up the
ladder from the set, chapter, or "dynasty" to the higher echelon in the BD gang hierarchy.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">THIS IS A GANG WHERE DRUG SELLING IS A GANG SPONSORED BUSINESS
ENTERPRISE</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>This gang does not exist solely and exclusively to sell drugs and do nothing else.  It has
meetings, parties, and reaches into many non-contiguous geographical areas.  It has unique hand
signs, gang logos, and written codes.  However, it is like other adult dominated centralized
authoritarian gang structures in that the vast majority of the "members" are youths, more specifically
underage juveniles, and there is one long recurring activity that this gang can at any time day or night
be found to be engaging in:  selling illegal drugs.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The term "putting in Nation work" means selling drugs for the gang set.  The phrase "getting
new work" from the gang means collecting a new batch of drugs for sale.  This may mean picking
up ten bags of marijuana, the proceeds from seven of the bags must be returned to the local gang
leader, the proceeds from the other three are "profit" for the individual member.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The vast majority of the illegal drug income goes directly up the ladder of this adult-driven
enterprise.  Every BD member we talked to indicated illegal drug sales was the primary activity of
the BDs and this was in fact a gang sponsored activity.  Much of the "internal rules" for gang
members in the BDs are designed to shield the gang and especially the leaders from criminal
prosecution regarding this activity.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">SOMETHING UNIQUE: SYNDICATED GAMBLING BY THE BDs</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Several informants mentioned the gambling enterprises of the BD's were intermixed with the
drug sales operations.  An apartment in a public housing complex, a house use for selling drugs, an
open deserted area: all qualify for settings for running large scale crap games.  Clearly, the same kind
of gambling goes on at the BD annual gang picnics (24th or 25th of May).  But we began to take
more notes on the gambling operations when they were a repeated them for this gang.  As one
informant detailed it: "the BDs are into gambling everywhere and gamble on everything, the fights,
superbowl, you name it, they do all types of betting, but dice and large crap games are their
specialty...like they will have a big ole crap game, 30 or 40 people there betting all at once, they have
so much security that nothing else is moving....because you have some guys....Derky started
it....sticking up the BDs trying to take their work money....they have lots of security always at the
craps....and there are a lot of weapons present...because there is so much money involved in crap
games that big."</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The BD's also make use of what they call "safe houses".  These safe houses are commonly
used for business: meetings, drug packaging, and gambling.  They prefer sound-proofed buildings,
because one of the forms of gambling the gang engages in involves &#8220;dog fights&#8221;. Dog fights are
fights to the death of one of the two dogs pitted against each other.  During &#8220;warm up&#8221; betting times
at the dog fights, to spur bets, it is not uncommon to have a handler throw a live cat into the dog ring
just to see the effect of the crowd of gamblers when the cat is rapidly dispatched by the dog.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">DUTIES OF THE BD LEADERS</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span>The "Minister" is the head position of a BD set.  The Minister is typically about 25 years of
age and supervises the Assistant Co-Minister and the First Demetrius in the BD set.  The assistant
co-minister facilitates drug sales or "putting in work" for the "Nation" (i.e., their BD gang), and also
collects dues from the BD members.  It is the First Demetrius who has hands-on supervision of the
BD members.  The First Demetrius calls the meetings, distributes gang literature, and makes sure
members do "work" for the gang ("work" means selling marijuana, cocaine, and heroin).  All of these
positions of rank (First Demetrius, Assistant Co-Minister, and Minister) are positions that are only
available to members who are 18 years of age and older.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">RITUALIZED VIOLENCE: MAINTAINING INTERNAL DISCIPLINE</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The BD's are typical in this respect: the members face "violations" for conduct or behavior
that is a threat to the social solidarity of the gang organization.  The "rules" of this gang are clear,
and in writing.  These are shown in some of the internal written documents of the BDs to be
discussed later in this gang profile.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Members who violate internal rules face a type of ritualized, violent, punishment in front of
other members of the same gang.  This punishment occurs at the meetings of the gang.  Smaller
violations can be met with a "thirty second violation", meaning thirty seconds of punishment meted
out by several members of the gang while the member being punished is held, with his arms behind
his back, as other members punch the victim in the chest for the time duration of the "violation"
being administered.  A small violation might be not paying dues or not showing up at meetings.  A
larger violation may entail a five minute beating.  And, of course, BDs have been known to kill their
own (i.e., Yummy).</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The typical smaller violations are for conduct that plagues any organization: failure to attend
meetings or pay dues.  The most serious violations have to do with "nation work".  When a member
returns an insufficient amount of money (comes up "short" on his "ends") this calls for a major
violation.  The same occurs when a member "loses" the drug stash that is supposed to be sold in
"nation work".  Another major violation would be insulting or disrespecting any BD leader,
including chapter or set leaders (Minister, Assistant Co-Minister, First Demetrius, etc). </span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">HOUSE PARTIES: A SOLIDARITY BUILDING MECHANISM FOR THE BDs</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span>The BDs regularly organize "house parties" in their neighborhoods.  Members and non-members alike will pay a small amount such as $3 for admittance.  Age is not a concern, anyone may
come to the house parties if they have the admittance fee.  In the house parties, the BDs present
establish the social status pecking order.  Members with rank in the gang clearly stand out.  Non-members take second seat to the BD members.  It is therefore an opportunity to recruit new members
to the BDs.  As it affords a time for social interaction, drinking and smoking marijuana, with local
BD leaders it is also a solidarity building mechanism for the gang.  They are able to have their "good
time" on a social basis where their membership counts for something.  It is in this context of the
"house parties" that the rules of the gang really come into play, particularly about disrespecting
leaders or other members.  Members are careful about the jokes and the expressions they use in their
conversations and interactions with other members.  They learn to be "on guard" socially.  For
example, they may want to express how they detest another member, but they really cannot do so,
as it would call for a "violation".  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>House parties are also occasions to honor the birthdays of area BD leaders.  A cake will be
decorated with the BD gang symbols, honoring the birthday of the BD leader, which is also an
occasion for taking polaroid photographs.  The NGCRC has obtained quite a collection of these over
the years.  The main gang symbols decorated on the birthday cake will be the six pointed star of
david, inside the star will be the "III" symbol.  The "III" symbol is a key logo to the BDs.  At the top
of the Star of David will be "King" and at the bottom of the star "David".  To the left and right will
be names of other important gang members, perhaps including some deceased and some active
members who are honoring the gang leader with the cake.  </span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">HAND SIGNS: BEWARE THESE ARE NOT BOY SCOUTS</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span>The BD hand sign looks similar to that used by the Boy Scouts.  The hand sign for the BD's
is to depress the thumb tip to cover the depressed little finger, leaving three extended fingers pointing
upwards.  Most use the right hand, but depending on the occasion or context the left hand will also
do.  This is signifying the "trey", the "III" sign.  Another sign is the fists clenched, knuckles out, with
right hand on top of the left hand in front of the body.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In the BD hand sign the three extended fingers are slightly separated giving the "I I I" effect,
also known as the "trey" sign to the BDs.  A naive adult might mistake this sign for that used by Boy
Scouts.  </span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">TATTOOS</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Tattoos are common among the older BDs and among more hardcore younger members.  The
most common tattoo is a Star of David six pointed star with the "III" (trey) symbol, or simply
"B.D.N." or "B.D.".  Most of the juvenile members do not have the permanent tattoos.  It would not
be in the best interests of the BD gang to have its very young members with the tattoos, that way
being easy to identify by the parents of the same children.  Without the gang tattoo, the parent still
has plausible deniability as well: some just do not want to know for certain their child is in fact in
a gang.  It is common for parents to bury their children who have been members and claim "I never
knew he was in a gang or I would have done something about it".    </span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">MEETINGS AND MEETING PLACES</span></span></span></p>

In good or warmer weather, a large back porch may be used as a meeting site for the BDs. 
Sometimes an enclosed garage large enough to accommodate the meeting may be used.  Homes and
abandoned buildings are also used.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The two most common items on the agenda of any BD meeting are: violations and paying
dues. The violations to members are dispensed at these meetings.  Dues are also collected at
meetings.  Dues are typically $5.00 for a member payable every time there is a meeting.  It seems
there is no fixed date for BD meetings, they are called by the set leaders on an as needed basis.  This
averages about two meetings a month for a typical BD set.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Going to meetings for the BD gang, perhaps as in other gangs, can be a time for fear for the
gang members.  One of the things they fear most is that they will be singled out by their own gang. 
Here is how one informant described the situation: "when they have meetings they call on someone
to recite the prayer at random...whoever they call upon better know the prayer from front to back by
memory, because if they do not they will be dealt with harshly....they will get a violation....the
members have to know their gang literature....they regard it as sacred material...at the meetings they
put a religious meaning on it".</span></span></p>

Milwaukee, Wisconsin over the years.  If we were to believe the qualitative data from the book
<span style="text-decoration: underline">People and Folks</span> we would believe no such real Chicago connection exists.  The El Rukn's were the
first to discover the value of selling Chicago drugs in laid-back comfortable Milwaukee.  Louis
Hoover (an El Rukn) "was one of two generals who ran El Rukn's Milwaukee drug operation in the
late 1970's and 1980's" (see: Chicago Tribune, May 27, 1992, section 2, p. 9, Matt O'Connor).  We
have heard from several informants interviewed specifically for this BD profile that a BD chapter
was intentionally formed in Milwaukee as well in the mid 1980's.       </span></span></p>

a summer in 1992...the way they got started is guys from Chicago went up there to sell drugs, it is
a better environment for the drug scenery....you get your own strip....your own spot....that's your
strip...you run that....its like a McDonalds....how do you get a strip in Chicago, its almost impossible,
everything is being used. The BD leaders have got it scouted out everywhere, so to open up your own
operation in a place like Milwaukee, what you got to do is talk to the man in Stateville, he will give
you the okay to open up this place, but without the word you cannot make a move.....BDs are
nationwide.....its a nationwide thing".</span></span></p>

international attention to the BD gang in late August, and early September, 1994.  Yummy belonged
to the BD set called the "8 balls", because this particular set of BDs was geographically located at
108th Street.  Yummy was not a peewee, nor simply an associate, he was a BD member.  Yummy
got his name "Yummy" because he liked cookies so much.  By the time Yummy reached the ripe old
age of 11, when he would be executed by his own gang, he had already accumulated a record that
included 12 felony arrests.  His set of the gang sent Yummy out to shoot at some GDs.  His gang
chief gave Yummy a 9mm semi-automatic pistol.  The result was predictably tragic: Yummy did fire
the weapon and was able to wound two members of the GDs, however, a stray round from the gun
fired by Yummy ended up killing a non-gang member, a 14-year-old girl named Shavon Dean, who
was simply an innocent bystander.  Chicago was outraged and horrified at this event.  Yummy hid
and went back to the 8-Balls.  Then members from an adjoining BD set (Edbrook) executed Yummy,
shooting him in the back of the head with a .25-caliber semiautomatic handgun.  </span></span></p>

Yummy belonged to the "8-Ball" set of the BDs, this set is still based at 108th Street and Perry in
Chicago.  The set whose members actually killed Yummy is located at 107th and Edbrook, called
the Edbrook set.  Another nearby set includes "Dirty Perry", the BD set at 107th and Perry.</span></span></p>

brother Cragg Hardaway (16).  Both told police their gang leader directed them to get rid of Yummy. 
Their gang leader had provided them with a car to transport Yummy in, the ruse being that they
would take Yummy away from Chicago.</span></span></p>

full fledged members, but are unlikely to rise to prominence in the male dominated authoritarian
cult-like organization.  In some sets, up to 30 percent of the members are females.  Generally,
females are not "sexed in" as an initiation ceremony, which may be due to the fact that most of the
sets are very provincial in nature: sometimes covering only a one block area of "turf".  Leadership
positions are, in theory, open to women.  However, no women are known to have had major
positions in the BDs over a long period of time.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Similar to other gangs, the BD's have a separate "wing" in their membership for older or
hardcore female members.  It is called the "Daughters of the Universal Star".  It is basically a female
branch.  As one informant described it: "they have their own sessions; they have their little meetings;
they have to appoint a chief over them; you respect them and their rank; they make decisions, and
if you are asked to do something and get it cleared, you have to use your judgement, they will
mislead you....they sell drugs, they kill, they give violations, just the same as the men do".  Still,
there is limited realistic opportunity for "rank advancement" for females in the BDs.  </span></span></p>

Mickey Cobras, and Vice Lords (i.e., brothers or peoples, gangs riding under the 5 pointed star). 
However, on the streets BDs have been known to battle it out with GDs on a regular basis as well. 
One informant described how a BD had drugs stolen from him by a GD.  The BDs subsequently
administered a brutal beating to the GD.  Not surprisingly the GDs then came to the BD set and
"blasted away", shooting up the neighborhood.  </span></span></p>

risky activity can place them in conflict with virtually any other gang that is also involved in drug
trafficking.  </span></span></p>

gang picnic.  The BD's celebrate his birthday with a large gang picnic, usually on May 24th or May
25th.  It is the equivalent of a kind of Mardi Gras for the BD's.  At Ogden Park at 63rd and Racine,
a public park on Chicago's southside, every May 24th there is a picnic in honor of the memory of
"King David".  One will also find an assortment of other parties and celebrations occurring in
individual residences at this important date in Chicago.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The "King David" commemorative t-shirt is often worn at these events.  It is a professionally
made full size picture of King David.  The cheapest version sells for around $50.   </span></span></p>

"picnics" for their members at least once a year.  The GD picnics were very well organized and
involved many restrictions on the members: no drugs, no guns, no fighting, because to a large extent
it was also a publicity gimmick --- there were elected officials (i.e., politicians) who were attending
the GD picnic.  The BD picnics sound like a lot more fun from a gang member point of view.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>A 1995 BD picnic was similar to the GD style in that members were transported on
commercially leased busses.  What is different is that one of the BD picnics in 1995 was actually
held in the State of Minnesota, thus members were transported across state lines.  We interviewed
one of the BD members who attended the 1995 picnic in Minnesota.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>he BD picnic had bountiful amounts of food just like the GD picnic.  But it also had drugs. 
Members were given as much marijuana as they could smoke for free.  There was also a large
amount of gambling going on.  So the BD picnic is more expressive (i.e., have a good time), while
the GD picnic is more instrumental (i.e., being on good behavior to impress politicians and non-members invited as a public relations ploy).</span></span></p>

informants: prefers late model Cadillacs, wears a lot of gold and a rolex watch and a lot of blue
jogging suits.  However, currently he has only the "props" available to him in a correctional context,
as he is serving time in Stateville.  He is described as: "quiet, but a very very smooth character, just
like Willie Lloyd", "flamboyant in a way, but like an educated banker on the street level", "quite an
operator, a real manipulator", "a real shrewd guy, always competing with Don Derky", "Shorty has
more class than most gang members, Shorty is a family man with several kids from the same wife". 
So he is described as being rather calm and collected, but with another side that can sometimes
manifest itself.  We can illustrate this below.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>One incident where Shorty Freeman "lost his cool" was described to us.  This happened when
Shorty Freeman was still in Cook County Jail during his trial, before he went to IDOC (Illinois
Department of Corrections) where he is currently incarcerated.  Here is how an informant who was
present at the incident described it: </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>"One of our members was in the day room with his boxer shorts on, and it was the time for
the day visits in this unit of Cook County Jail.  Shorty Freeman was getting a visit from a female at
the time and saw our member walking around in his boxer shorts and got offended.  Shorty Freeman
told the guy to put his clothes on because it was disrespectful to walk around like that in the jail
dayroom when his lady could see him.  Our member said basically fuck off.  The next day the BDs
started a confrontation with our mob, so we tore it up with the BDs."</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>King Shorty is today serving out his sentence in the Illinois Department of Corrections
(IDOC) adult division.  On or about 2001 it is said that Jerome Freeman saw the writing on the wall
and wanted to try to get out of prison without being arrested at the front gate as has happened to
other gang leaders.  So Jerome claims to have &#8220;stepped down&#8221; from his throne of being &#8220;King
Shorty&#8221;.  This is a controversial issue because it goes to the issue of validity which we will discuss
below.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The validity of the abdication of &#8220;King Shorty&#8221; cannot be properly evaluated at present, but
given the limited data the validity is suspect at best.  The reason is that we have not seen the true
high levels of &#8220;anti-violence&#8221; sincerity surface yet: he has not really become an &#8220;ex&#8221; gang member
he has just told the public that he is removing himself from the fray.  But the public has heard this
before, in the case of Vice Lord leaders for example, like Willie Lloyd: Lloyd comes out of prison
and claims to be no longer associated with the gang, but enjoys all the benefits of being the gang
leader including heavily armed &#8220;body guards&#8221; from his gang.  So gang leaders in Illinois know they
can dodge some heat by claiming to be &#8220;out of the gang&#8221;, because there are a remarkable number of
people who just want to believe them.  In Willie Lloyd&#8217;s case (before he was shot up most believe
by his own gang) he even got a job teaching at a local Chicago university, and of course he was a
paid federal research assistant during the same time frame.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In the case of &#8220;King Shorty&#8221; the best position to take here is that the &#8220;jury is still out&#8221; on
whether this is a genuine abdication.   The BD&#8217;s are a gang with some remarkable connections in
government, including the criminal justice system: they have had decades to &#8220;develop moles&#8221; and 
have systematically corrupted persons in government, including police and correctional officers.  </span></span></p>

position of leadership is a gambit to gain release from prison, or whether it is a genuine effort to get
out of the position of paid royalty he is accustomed to: will he become less of a &#8220;hands on&#8221;
administrator of the gang, and more of a &#8220;figure head&#8221; King?  Will his gang continue to pay him and
worship him?  And most importantly: when will &#8220;King Shorty&#8221; himself actually denounce the gang
as an organization that terrorizes its own communities?  When will he order his &#8220;underlings&#8221; to turn
in their guns and drugs?  Don&#8217;t hold your breath is our advice.  </span></span></p>

The information about dealing with gang leaders was useful to the present profile.  This narcotics

Shorty Freeman on the streets of Chicago over a long period of time.  Here is his story:</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>"I know Shorty Freeman....drugs is his livelihood...I dealt with him on the street....he used

with him at all times, one actually lived with Shorty.  Shorty had a house on 51st and Morgan....as
I recall Don Derky's house was not too far away from there, they kept a watch on each other's
operations, Shorty had more followers, but Don Derky did everything short of having Shorty killed

except with the BD's its more like a close knit family, they are not as organized as Hoover's mob. 
But as far as business is concerned, Shorty does not take any prisoners, I dealt with him hand to hand
for about five years I should know.  He was real careful."</span></span></p>

but he also liked the parties, and the money making opportunities in the gang.  He also described that
King Shorty basically runs his gang remotely from behind bars almost the same way that Larry
Hoover administered the GDs:  "in Stateville he sits back and lives like a king, inside he is treated
like he is on the outside, he dresses like he is on the outside wearing clothes most inmates cannot
have, he wears a lot of jewelry inmates cannot have, and he has cash money on him that no inmate
is supposed to have, and he has it with him on his possession at all times, like he is on the street...he
has guys on security with him where ever he walks, he is never alone.. in prison the way he runs it,
its just like Hoover runs it...they have their gatherings.....most of the time they go to church...they
use church as a shield....protestant church....you can't be in no big crowd because of prison
rules....except in church....they spread the word among themselves in small groups when they meet
in church."</span></span></p>

constant time in the visiting room of Stateville.  This is how he sends his "orders" to the streets,
through his emissaries.  Said one informant "he is just like Hoover....Shorty has steady stream of
visitors every day, like Hoover they send out the orders for the streets".</span></span></p>

to be a real character, he started an ugly riot in Division 1 at Cook County Jail, Don is a lot older
than Shorty, Don Derky started a chapter in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the early 1980's."  Thus, the
Don Derky faction of the BDs appears to be a renegade faction within the BDs.  However, there is
no doubt about the fact that Shorty Freeman is the acknowledged leader of most factions of the BDs. 
It is obvious as well from different sources that there is a strained relationship between Shorty
Freeman and Don Derky.  The best way to describe the renegade gang leader Don Derky is that while
the BDs have a kind of religious structure to their gang, Don Derky's faction splintered off like a
separate sect using the same type of gang gospel, just on a smaller scale.  </span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The initiation ceremony for new members who are becoming BD's is a relatively simple
procedure.  The members are not required to engage in a violent crime to show their commitment
to the gang.  The members are not beaten to test their physical ability to withstand pain.  The
members simply recite the gang prayer and afterwards the other members present at the meeting put
the "treys" on the head of the inductee.  "Treys on the head" is the expression describing when the
BD member places the three fingers of the right hand, the BD gang hand sign, on the head of the
initiate.  During the initiation ceremony several members present will place their three finger gang
hand sign to touch the head of the new member as a "blessing".  Once that is done, the child is a
member of the BDs and can begin paying dues and doing their "Nation work".  As with other gangs,
most new members are children, with an average age of 12.  They have about six years of "Nation
work" (i.e., selling drugs for the gang) before they are eligible to hold any official position of rank
in the gang organization of the BDs.  If they are fortunate to live that long, then they typically have
accumulated a juvenile arrest record that hardens and prepares them for an adult criminal career.  </span></span></p>

gangs where it is "blood in, blood out".  Leaving simply involves an agreement not to join any other
gang in the future.  Leaving should have a justification: "taking a job", "going back to school",
"family problems", etc, that is any legitimate "face saving" excuse to sever ties to the gang.  Under
these optimal conditions, the gang member attends the last meeting, the member invokes the prayer
and becomes instantly "inactive" in membership status.  However, sometimes when it is known a
member is trying to get out other members will provoke a conflict.</span></span></p>

inclination makes a verbal insult to any other member of the same gang, then the exit ceremony
comes with a "violation".  The member must endure a ritual physical beating in addition to the other
requirements.  </span></span></p>

in the same small geographical area, typically a one block area.  They are in constant daily contact
with each other in this environment.  It is therefore very hard not to associate with the same gang
members even after leaving the gang.  Such inactive members cannot use any gang signs or associate
with any gang members and are expected not to reveal the "nation secrets" of the BDs. A child
literally needs to go on "house lock down" status to avoid daily contact with these other gang

meeting at the neighborhood store, fast food place, etc).</span></span></p>

WHICH IT RESIDES?</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span>Mostly, it provides a subcultural economic benefit: a reliable ongoing continual source of
illicit drugs for casual drug users who may also reside in the same neighborhood, work there, or
routinely visit there.  The BD gang provides the drugs of choice: marijuana and cocaine on the
southside, add heroin to the list on the westside.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>For the casual drug abusing customers of the gang, they may feel "protected" in this
community setting.  The nature of their contact to the drug supply is friendly and courteous.  They
never worry about being "ripped off" or sold "bad drugs".  They are satisfied customers.  If they live
in the same area, the reciprocal ties that develop help to ensure that the gang does not steal their car
parts, or harass them, in fact, quite the obverse, they may in the spirit of modern drug pushing
"protect their customers".  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The gang resides in the same area where it does its drug business.  The community sees these
children on the street and knows they are "local boys".  The community rarely sees the concealed
weapons.  When the community hears the routine gun shots the same community wants to believe
this was from "outsiders".  News flash: no community anywhere in the world wants to believe its
own members are responsible for any of its own problems.  Thus, the local rumor mill always helps
the local gang: the gunshots were "outsiders", but fortunately the local gang was there to "protect the
hood" from invading outsiders.  Thus, the myth persists that gangs have a prosocial function to
protect the neighborhood.  The gang protects its business only.  The gang's business is drug sales.

someone as powerful as he was, or as "notorious" as he is made out to be, as a historical figure in
the world of Chicago gangs.  We are reviewing the Chicago Police Department rap sheet here. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rap sheet of King David never once lists his full and correct name (i.e., Donise David
Barksdale).  This is not uncommon.  Arrestees often may give names other than their own is the
reason.  So the official rap sheet maintained by the Chicago Police Department (I.R. #101573) is for
"David Jones".  But it is really David Barksdale.</span></span></p>

considered "minor offenses", and typical gang member offenses (disorderly conduct, mob action,
etc).  It does help, however, to provide a glimpse into the developmental lifespan of this legendary
gang figure.</span></span></p>

and foremost still regard him as their true king; the GD's who acknowledge his historical influence;
and the BGs who arose out of his death, splintering away as a separate faction from the BGDs.      
  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW DO THE BD's RECRUIT NEW MEMBERS?</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Answer: the BD gang has simply twisted the elements of enhancing salesmanship skills of
youthful members not too dissimilar from the way a Junior Achievement group would also raise
money collectively.  The BD gang offers young members a chance to have some "pocket money"
from selling drugs for the gang.  It offers kids a way to have a "good time" with adults in their
community: the adult gang leaders.  It has parties, out of state picnics, and provides an assortment
of "thrill seeking" opportunities.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A casual review of the internal written documents of the BDs suggests much of this "gang
literature" is aimed at children.  The gang becomes their "religion".  The local gang leader who hands
out the drugs to be sold becomes their "minister".  The top banana of the gang leaders becomes the
equivalent of a God-like figure that members are expected to be willing to kill or die for.  The young
members of the gang regularly engage in "prayer" with fellow members: but the kind of prayer we
are talking about here is an abomination.  Clearly, these materials show the kind of cult-like "hold"
that this gang is capable of having on its young members, once they do join.        </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The fact is the BD's like other gangs often do not have to spend an ounce of effort in
"recruitment" per se.  Kids will come to them.  </span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">LIKE A UNION GUILD, THE BD'S WILL HELP THEIR OWN MEMBERS</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The BD's are similar to other gangs in being an organization that provides some "benefits"
to those who are arrested or end up in jail.  This is common for most gangs like the BD's that qualify
as being a formal organization.  Explained one informant "they will send members money for
cosmetics, books, cigarettes in jail; but if you are not true to the gang, don't hold your hand out
because you've got nothing coming".</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">THREAT RATING OF THE BDs</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Given the nature of the organization and that it is unable to keep many older members, and
therefore operates much like a business franchise: where any leader in good standing can have his
own "plantation", the level of threat here is not as high as a more centralized corporate structure. 
The BDs profile more for migration-franchising: opening up new operations in new geographical
areas (i.e., Milwaukee).  They do not control sections where they do not live.  The top gang
leadership is able to make a good living off of this type of youth slavery and except in the case of
Yummy, has been able to avoid "heat" from the media or community.  It minimizes its risks, and
maximizes its gains to the older adult leadership structure.  It could persist for decades, being careful
not to draw much attention, not engaging in politics, and sticking to its criminal mission: drug profits
for the adult leaders from the "nation work" of its underage juvenile members who are lured into this
kind of oppression.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>So, the threat level is medium from a crime perspective, because all a community needs to
do to challenge and undermine this kind of gang is directly confront it and its leaders and its
"teachings".  The threat level is not high because this kind of gang does not profile as one capable
of acts of domestic terrorism, unless a hostile foreign national group were to approach the adult
leaders.  Something as simple as a civil RICO action, or a wrongful death 3rd party law suit against
adult leaders of the BDs would be sufficient to put a good dent in this kind of gang.  On the other
hand it may take a new type of "radio free inner city" to get the message across that this type of gang
is more than a gang: it is a new kind of slavery cult run by adult criminals.  The slaves are the
children of the community who get sucked into the gang and its weird belief system.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>However, since the GD prosecution we have noted a number of "flippers": GD's joining the
BD's.  So if the BD's are able to capture a lot of GD members, it is possible the BD threat rating
could increase in the coming years.  The BD's and the BG's are the most likely to benefit from
alienated members of the GD's trying to find a better gang.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Still, for the present the threat rating for the BDs must be regarded as medium for a variety
of reasons explored in this profile.  One "ex" BD expressed it best: "the BDs are not that deep, they
are real shallow, their king is not an entrepreneur, he is more or less a dictator".</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">INTERNAL WRITTEN DOCUMENTS OF THE BDs</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Figures 1 through 9 provide examples of the internal written documents of the Black
Disciples (BDs).  Each of these will be briefly explained here.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Figure 1 is the basic prayer of the BDs.  Here Donise David Barksdale is truly in direct
competition with every local church in Chicago for known spiritual leaders.  Note that "God" does
appear in this prayer.  But King David Barksdale is the one regarded as the true prophet for these
believers.  This is not a guy who has fought bravely in battle, this is not a guy who has saved
anyone&#8217;s life, this is not even a guy who has a good reputation for anything that would be a &#8220;positive
contribution to the community&#8221;: but he remains an example of ancestor worship within this
particular gang.  This phenomenon of &#8220;deification&#8221; of the gang leader is common in gangs like the
BD&#8217;s that have been around for decades and are now span several generations within their respective
communities.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Another prayer, provided in Figure 2, is interesting as a historical reference, for it
acknowledges the original BGD six point star meanings currently still used by the GDs: Love, Life,
Loyalty, Knowledge, Wisdom, and Understanding.  In a later document we will see that "unity"
becomes a new organizing principle.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Figure 3 provides the first set of "rules" or "laws" that BD members must abide by.  Rule #6
becomes definitive: "I will accept no other teachings than that of our KING or that which refers to
the Nation".  Clearly, this rule establishes an ideological press upon members that whatever type of
religious training or socialization they may have had, what they now must believe and act upon are
the "creeds" of their gang.  Rule # 8 continues in this theme, to the effect of almost inoculating BD
members against any outside religious influence.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>They truly are "devil's disciples": a cult-like group with blasphemous dogma at the heart of
its belief system that is enforced by violence and the threat of violence against its believers.  Note
the "top down" vertical authoritarian structure implied by rule # 10: "I will abide by all commands
given to me by the KING and all appointed chiefs".  Clearly, there is little room for individual
thinking or even an ability to resist this coercive compliance structure when the older adult leaders
ask a younger member of the gang like "Yummy" to perform an act or behavior that pleases the
central leadership.  Note also the rule #16 about the clenched fist "salute", the warrior sign for
ritually greeting other BD members.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Figure 4 is the second part of the rules or laws of the BD gang.  In some versions of this internal
written document of the gang, the word "soldier" has been translated to "member".  "Soldier" was
the original version.  This is interesting as a psychological mechanism, for the first part of the rules
(Figure 3) may not seem too bad for a potential new recruit to the BD gang being "courted" or lured
into the gang.  However, once initiated the member will find out there is another set of rules: those
in Figure 4.  The rules in Figure 4 are centered around protecting the gang leaders from criminal
prosecution.  This second set of rules requires "silence" on the criminal drug operations of the gang
or any other nation business, and specifically lays out rules about exposing the gang leaders to
unnecessary risk.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We interviewed a retired member of the BD's who knew King Shorty personally.  He was now
in a drug program, in his late 30's, and had spent about 15 years in the BD's.  The highest rank he
achieved was that of a chief of violations, a kind of temporary rank that is more service than power. 
This informant indicated these rules are taken literally by the members.  Even the rule about
prostitution: "if you get caught with a sister of the gang ho'ing, that is going to bring you some
punishment, you cannot use your sisters like that in the BD's".</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same informant described the importance of rule # 7 on protecting or shielding the "Crowned
King", King Shorty:</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">"if we pull up on the set, and the King was in a building up stairs, you cannot tell anyone the King
is there in an apartment.  When we go to a funeral, there will be a lot of guys just surrounding the
King, so many that you will not see him".  He went on to describe a funeral in 1984 where 6 or 7
hundred members attended.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Figure 5 is internal propaganda designed to enhance the social solidarity of members and give
them their unique gang identity and belief system.  Thus, Figure 5 gives literal meaning to the gang
symbols used by the BDs.  A photograph of the actual layout of a BD "banner" using all of these
symbols is provided (Photograph #1) for reference purposes.  This banner and a host of other
artifacts used by the gang are a part of the National Gang Cultural Artifact Exhibit which includes
such materials from a large number of major gangs in the USA that is maintained by the NGCRC
for training purposes.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Figure 6 is an introductory lesson for BD members: basic essential items of indoctrination they
must commit to memory.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Figure 7 is another brainwashing component in the BD curriculum of youth socialization.  Note
that here we see "unity" added as one of the principles of the six pointed star, while the original BGD
item of "wisdom" disappears from the map.  No one in this organization in their right mind would
challenge the fact that earlier documents include "wisdom" but apparently this item is lost in more
updated documents: to question this obvious inconsistency would be tantamount to treason against
the BD leaders.  Clearly, a typical BD member with any ability to discern such factors would
obviously also have to develop a strong sense of being able to survive in a situation of ambiguity and
dissonance.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Figure 8 begins to show us how in the pseudo-biblical language used by the gang leaders to make
demands on BD gang members, that this is truly a criminal cult organization, where the continuity
of the gang is predicated on its ability to underage juvenile manipulate members along a spiritual
dimension that allows the members to engage in moral neutralization (i.e., an adult sponsored
justification for their criminal behavior).  Note the language of "thou shall" in these
"commandments".  Here young children with unknown levels of religious training are getting new
"homework": things they really must study or they will be physically punished by their own gang and
they will not dare report it to anyone outside of the gang.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>This new "homework" makes the gang leader the new GOD, and some gang henchman who
wrote the material the real "Moses" imparting the 10 commandments.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>This is more than a "put on", young children like "Yummy" are routinely being killed over
this kind of new modern gang-criminal-cult style organization.  It should be patently obvious to us
all that the last person to probably ever see this kind of material is the local church or religious
institution and its legitimate spiritual leaders in the same community!  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Religious leaders in America who have worked with gangs to sponsor their events, activities,
and public relations functions are going to have to come to grips with this kind of evidence.  This
kind of gang is not going to be coopted.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, Figure 9 provides the equivalent of a daily scripture or a daily prayer to reinforce the
identity and commitment to the adult driven criminal gang leader.  Whatever the gang leader "says"
is what "goes".  We see in none of these internal documents anything that spells out in great detail
what the "teachings" are of the "crowned" King Shorty.  Apparently his will is the gospel.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Churches in inner city areas like those affected by the presence of gang organizations like the
BDs need no longer speculate about why they are having difficulty attracting younger persons to
worship in their religious institutions.  The message should be very clear from this gang profile that
gangs like the BDs have been competing for years with churches for the control of the "minds,
bodies, and souls" of inner city children.     </span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In 1998 a number of BD leaders were arrested for federal charges.  Some of them, like Robert
Allen Jr. and Charles Jackson, agreed to cooperate with federal authorities.  This is a standard "trade-off": those who snitch usually get lighter sentences.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Thus, in 1999, some 21 members of the BD gang were indicted for federal drug charges in
Chicago.  The federal authorities were able to get a large number of indictments due to the prominent
help from informants within the leadership of the BD gang.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>BD leader Robert Allen made statements against 16 of the 21 BDs indicted in 1999.  Allen
did get a 20 year sentence, but he was facing life in federal prison, like many of his colleagues he
testified against (See: Cam Simpson, "21 in Black Disciples Named in Drug Charges", <span style="text-decoration: underline">Chicago Sun-Times</span>, Dec. 9, 1999, p. 18).</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In the spring of 2004 another massive federal prosecution was launched against leaders of
the Black Disciples: Marvel Thompson and 41 other BD&#8217;s in the upper management of the gang
were indicted..  This was designed to disrupt a $500,000 per day drug selling operation run by the
BD&#8217;s.  This new prosecution effort focused also on some of the business enterprises used as &#8220;money
laundering&#8221; facilities for the gang: a gangster rap music studio, a construction company, rental
properties, etc.  During raids in at the time of unveiling the indictments, police officers discovered
&#8220;sensitive police information&#8221; in an envelope in the custody of one of the gang&#8217;s leaders, and a
followup showed that it came from the local elected alderman: Aranda Troutman.  Alderman
Troutman told federal investigators she thought the gang leaders were just &#8220;businessmen&#8221;, although
others in the community noted that she was very close to the gang leaders.  One of the leaders of the
BD gang had received a license as a security guard.  A police officer who worked for the Cook
County Sheriff&#8217;s Department at the time of this writing is also being investigated to determine if he
was the one who was running car license plates for the gang. </span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW TO SUPPRESS THE BDs AND SIMILAR GANGS</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>There are two known historical truths about the persistence and continuity of criminal gangs
that have so much support they can be likened to social laws.  The first is based on systems theory,
the idea that a gang without new members to do its "work" is a gang that will die off and fade away,
a gang needs a steady supply of new young recruits to stay in business.  The second is based on
risk/benefit analysis: a gang cannot exist in a community without providing some benefit to the same
community, so once the reciprocal benefits are terminated, and there is no benefit to the gang, the
gang will disappear.  Both help to clarify "what should be done" about gangs like the BDs.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>First, our society needs additional laws protecting the rights of juveniles, both civil and
criminal penalties need to be attached to the conduct of adult gang leaders who use children to do
their dirty work.  Increasing the penalties for using juveniles in adult-run gangs, and doing everything
else possible to cut off the flow of new recruits into a gang, will do much to destabilize any gang
anywhere in systems theory.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Secondly, the risk-benefit equation currently favors adult gang leaders: they face little risk
and almost no sanctions for using juveniles to do their dirty work (selling drugs, committing acts of
violence against opposing gangs, etc).  We as a society need to increase the "costs" to the adult gang
leaders in this known national pattern of the criminal exploitation of children.  We need to also
eliminate any social benefits the gang claims to provide a community: involvement in voter
registration, involvement in publicly funded services, anything that appears to give the gang
"legitimacy" erodes the power of the community to fight back against the gangs.  Some leaders in
Chicago and elsewhere still have not figured this out.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Third, educating clergy, civic leaders, and parents about gang profiles like the BDs may help
them recognize that the gang is not a benefit to the community, nor is it a benign social force that
can be "turned into good": it is, plain and simple, a criminal organization.  What we have in America
today is a legal lag: gangs have continued over time, outpacing the ability of American policy makers
to pass legislation to control their operations.  In otherwords, due to the inaction of policy makers,
modern American gangs like the BDs continue with "business as usual" and are able to flagrantly
manipulate the system to their own benefit.  </span></span></p>
