               How to Sew Fast! 21 Tips to Help Speed Up Your Sewing                                                                                                                                                                our concentration. Then we make mistakes that take time to correct.    Therefore, try leaving the        t.v. and     stereo off when you sew and letting the answering machine pick up. And can you steal      some time for     yourself when you’re not likely to be interrupted? Perhaps early in the morning or      late at night?             Tip #2 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Be organized.           Have a place for every tool. For instance, have a place on the wall for hanging your guide      sheet,     scissors, and tape measure. Keep all of those itty, bitty tools  like presser feet and      bobbins in plastic,     sectioned trays. Keep larger tools and interfacings in drawers.           And put your tools back when you’re finished with them so you can easily find them again.            This is so much better than having everything thrown in a sewing basket that you have to      rummage     through every time you need a tool.                 Tip #3 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Keep your tools in good, working order.            Keep your scissors sharp. Use sharp pins and seam rippers. Keep your sewing machine well      maintained and use a new machine needle for every project.             Tip #4 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Keep your work area is well lit.            Constantly having to squint to see what you’re doing slows you down. Plus, the better you can      see     your work, the less likely you are to make mistakes – such as accidentally clipping into a      seam or     sewing crooked stitches.                 Tip #5 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Designate an area in your home just for sewing.            I know this may be impractical for some. But if you can swing it, the time saving benefits can be      great.            When you have a separate sewing space, you don’t spend time setting up your sewing      machine,     cutting board, and ironing board every time you want to sew. And you don’t spend      time putting     everything back when you’re done.            You can also more easily fit sewing into those smaller pockets of time we all have – ten minutes      here     to pin an item together, fifteen minutes there to stitch a seam.            As an alternative to a separate sewing room, can you steal a corner of a room that can be      hidden     with a folding screen or curtain? Can you convert a closet to a sewing space you can      close the doors     on when you’re done for the day?                 Tip #6 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Do all your prep work before start your project.            Make sure you have all the notions you need to complete your project – buttons, zippers,      thread, etc.     Make sure you have the interfacings and linings you need.            Preshrink your fabrics, interfacings, linings, and notions.            Set up your ironing board and get all your tools out (unless, of course, you have a separate      sewing     space where everything is already set up).                 Tip #7 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Make an item you’ve made before.            You’re already familiar with the steps involved in the construction. Therefore, the skirt that took      you     ten hours to make the first time may only take you six hours this time. And when you make      it a third     time, it may take only four hours.            Also, all of your pattern pieces have already been cut from the tissue. And you’ve already made      the     necessary alterations to the pieces.            If you fear ending up with a “boring” wardrobe this way (having six of the “same” skirt or      blouse in     your closet), choose different fabric colors, prints, and textures. Another fabric can      make a design look     completely different – and no one will notice it’s the same basic garment.             Tip #8 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Make a variation of an item you’ve made before. For instance, make a skirt you’ve made before,      but in     a different length. Or make the short sleeve version of a blouse    you’ve made before.                 Tip #9 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Make several of the same item at the same time. This allows you to do similar steps in an      assembly     line manner.            Therefore, if you’re making three of the same shirt, sew all the side seams at once, sew all      three     collars in succession, etc.            The one extra step you may need to take is re-threading your machine with a different thread      for     each item. But in spite of this extra step, you’ll still likely save time.             Tip #10 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Choose a simple pattern with few design details.            You’ll have fewer pattern markings to transfer, less sewing and pressing to do, and fewer      potential     mistakes to make.                 Suggestions:                 Garment designs without pockets, linings, or pleats.            A pant or a skirt design without a waistband or a design with an elastic waist.            A skirt design without a vent.            A shirt or blouse design with a one-piece back (no back yoke to attach), short-    sleeves      (no cuffs     to make), or with a one-piece collar (no separate band to sew).            A jacket design with a shawl collar instead of a notched collar. Or a choose a     design with      no     collar at all.                Look for patterns labeled      Easy     ,      Fast     ,      Quick     , or      2 hour     .            And remember, “few design details” doesn’t have to mean “boring.” Choose interesting      fabrics.  And     remember, “simple” can often look sophisticated – as in the Basic Black Dress.             Tip #11 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Choose a looser-fitting design.            You’ll spend little or no time fitting or tailoring – or sewing shaping seams like darts and      princess     seams.             Tip #12 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Avoid fabrics that need the pattern pieces laid out a special way, such as stripes, plaids, one-     way     prints, and napped fabrics.            Solid colors and random patterns are good choices.                 Tip #13 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Stay away from fabrics that are difficult to work with or need special handling, such as silks,      sheers,     slippery satins, fabrics that ravel easily, napped fabrics like velvet, or very heavyweight      fabrics.                     Tip #14 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Lay your fabric out with the right sides together.            Your pattern pieces will have the right sides already together, saving yourself the step of      placing     them right sides together before stitching them.             Tip #15 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Use a rotary cutter for cutting out your fabric pieces. And use weights instead of pins. (Use      rotary     cutters with care because they’re very sharp. And make sure to use a special mat      underneath when     cutting.)             Tip #16 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Do “like” tasks at one time in an assembly-line manner.            It takes time to “shift gears.” To sew a seam, get up to press it, apply interfacing to your next      fabric     piece, etc.             Therefore:                 Pin as many fabric pieces together as you can before sewing seams        Sew as many seams together as you can before sections need to be joined        Do as much pressing as you can at once        Apply as much interfacing as you can to your fabric pieces at once        Do as much trimming and clipping of seam allowances as you can at once            This will likely mean going out of order from the pattern instructions. If you’re a beginning      sewer, you     may feel more comfortable trying this once you gain more experience.                 Tip # 17 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       If you’re really confident, don’t pin fabric sections together before sewing. Just place the fabric      pieces     together, then stitch. You may want to limit this technique to shorter seams you have      more control     over.             Tip #18 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Before you start to sew a seam, grasp the thread tails from the upper and bobbin threads.      Hold them     back and out of the way for your first couple of stitches.            This is a good preventative measure to keep your sewing machine from jamming – something      that     takes time to fix.                 Tip #19 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Put “pedal to the metal” when sewing.            In other words, actually      sew fast     – especially when sewing long, straight seams. Continue to      take     your time around corners and curves.                 Tip #20 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       Use pinking shears to finish the raw edges of your seam allowances instead of a more time      consuming method. And trim your seam allowances before pressing them open. This way, you’ll      be     cutting both edges at once.            Or if you’re fabric isn’t prone to raveling, leave your seam allowances unfinished.             Tip #21 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                                       And last, but not least, practice!            The more you do something, the better and the faster you get at it. And soon you’ll be able to      whip     something up in no time!

Tip #1 for Sewing        Fast                                                                                           Get rid of distractions.           People interrupt us.
