So many have gone before and many continue to serve. We are so blessed! I hope you have had the opportunity to check out the enhanced features of  Where’s Sue and have  voted for us to come to a location near you! Thanks to  Daniel and his elves for getting this wonderful site up and for giving you the opportunity to vote for us to come to a location near you! We won’t be there for a while but give the store near you a call and see what events and classes they have coming up! It is “sew” fun to fellowship with other sewers and quilters and to learn new tips and techniques! We are in Columbus with our son Herb and family and will travel to Florida this week to teach at a retreat with  Scrap and Sew in Lutz, FL then on to visit friends and take a little time off. Later in the summer we will work on selling our home in Ohio. More about that later. Herb and I worked the Salt Lake City Quilt Market with Sulky where I taught three Take & Teach classes. I wanted to show how great the new Sulky Sticky Fabri-Solvy is for transferring a design or pattern. I’ve been using it for quilting patterns, applique, etc. Since we did not have sewing machines in the classroom, we did a small “redwork embroidery by hand”. The 8 1/2 x 11 sheets of Sulky Sticky Fabri-Solvy can be printed in your ink jet printer. So I used my all-in-one to copy the embroidery design onto the Sticky Fabri-Solvy. (Remember you must own the pattern, book, etc to legally copy it. It is important to respect copyright laws.) Peel the paper off the back of the Sticky Fabri-Solvy, then stick it to the right side of the fabric to be embroidered. You have an exact accurate pattern to embroider with no tracing! Also, the fabric is protected from dirt, skin oils and other things on your hands as you embroider (especially if you snack while embroidering!). We used two strands of Sulky 12 weight cotton thread in the redwork red for the embroidery. What fun and “sew” easy! From Quilt Market we went to the Husqvarna Viking Convention in Reno. It was so wonderful to meet all our Husqvarna Viking friends and store owners and especially all our friends from Sweden. We have missed them! I had the privilege of introducing the new Husqvarna Viking Designer Diamond deLuxe with deLuxe Stitch System. A whole new way to control the top thread tension resulting in fabulous stitch quality. I embroidered a reversible jacket with a huge Majestic Hoop Design that comes on the Designer Diamond deLuxe using Sulky Holoshimmer on top and in the bobbin and it came out beautifully. There are many other new features, stitches, and more. After convention we presented a program for  Eddie’s Quilting Bee in Sunnyvale, CA and “sew” enjoyed seeing all our friends there. Fast, Faster, Fastest Quilting, plus a trunk show from Loralie and QuiltSmart meant lots of inspiration and ideas and fun. We had dinner with Carol Heidnereich and her family in San Jose. Carol was one of the first free lance educators I hired for Husqvarna Viking back in the 80’s and has brought quilting education and enjoyment to so many over the last 30 or so years. She just celebrated her 80th birthday and is doing great! From there we spent several days with our son Bob and family in San Jose and enjoyed catching up on all their activities. We’ll fill you in on the Florida trip next!
