The owner, a former designer who apparently is very sadistic in her treatment of people. I went her to purchase a sewing machine. While browsing at the yarn I over heard the owner get very aggressive with her 30 something student.  Really shocked when I asked to look at a sewing machine how nice one of the ladies was. How she tolerates working in these conditions is beyond me. I decided to purchase the yarn and sewing machine around the corner.  There are many places to shop and learn to sew in NYC without enduring this type of treatment. I purchased my machine at LoveSewing Center. They only sell manual machines, but you can ask for a higher end Janome model. It is a lot better than the ones at Sew Fast Sew Easy. Sewing Machines - LoveSewing - Janomes; ManhattanSewingCenter - Singer, Viking and Pfaff; Cityquilter - Berninas and there is also a place on 38th and 9th avenue that sells brother and Juki    helpful  (0)     not helpful  (0)     comment     share           04/06/11  Expensive Rude People waste of time and money $$$$$$$ by  NY11 at Citysearch Don't waste your time or $money this place stinks your better off learning on your own just buy the book online better off. The old Lady that works there is scary RUDE!!! .Not worth the money you will be lucky if you learn something before you drop out. The website is much more promising then the school itself. Very small they need a bigger space for what they charge. Moved on to a better school! : D    helpful  (0)     not helpful  (1)     comments  (1)     share           02/21/11  Professional Instruction from industry experts! by  rover49 at Citysearch Professional instruction from experts in the fashion industry. The classes are so fun and they teach you how to sew from a professional point of view. Sewfast Seweasy offers a wide variety of relevant sewing classes for fashionable pants, dresses and skirts to handbags. I started taking classes as an absolute beginner two years ago and now I am taking the advanced classes! It is really rewarding to master the skill set to make cute and fashion forward clothes!    helpful  (1)     not helpful  (1)     comment     share           12/28/10  BEWARE OF OWNER by  learningtoSew at Citysearch I have stopped in this business a couple of times over the years to purchase notions. The owner, who I assume is the older really direct somewhat rude woman who is always there, should be cautioned against. I recently took classes here and refuse to return. The first couple of times I went the staff seemed nice, she walked in and demanded the clerk come to the other room with a mean stare. The next visit, a nice lady with long black hair helped me purchase some yarn for a gift. I stepped out to the bathroom and when I returned they were yelling at each other in the other room talking about another "dumb" customer and a previous employee.  Finally, against my better judgement because my boyfriend bought a class for me, I returned. I took the class with the long black haired woman who previously rung me up. This was suppose to be an intermediate sewing class, but no one finished their skirts, several people quit prior to the start of the class and the patternmaking skills that are posted on the website were not completely covered. I am sure that if you are dead set on patternmaking, Parsons patternmaking classes are better constructed, and many other places even several blocks away, Love Sewing, Parsons, FIT are better suited for your money.  The owner is very abrassive so I wish I would have taken this class when a gentleman named James worked here. I missed my chance. If you look on craigslist for sewing classes I am sure you can find other even private classes like SewNY.  From what I understand from others in my class they took this class because the website was pretty and it came up first. Do your research for a good time!    helpful  (1)     not helpful  (0)     comments  (1)     share           11/15/10  Great classes regardless of your skill level! by  lurdis01 at Citysearch I have been sewing and making children's clothes for a while but never could get anything to fit me well. I took the intermediate skirt class and I finally made something for myself that fits great!! There are so many variations that they teach you that you could honestly make an entire wardrobe for yourself! I plan to take the dress class next! Thank you ladies for your wonderful teaching!    helpful  (0)     not helpful  (1)     comment     share         Write a Review See more Sew Fast Sew Easy Inc reviews     The Details on  Sew Fast Sew Easy Inc  Place Categories:    great price great experience worst customer service excellent beginner class helpful quality products great staff really helpful instructor really enjoyed beginner sewing class not good enough fresh spoiled kids not perfect sewing school friendly knowledgebased teachers hate sales people highly recommend sewing classes great fair prices big fan suggest sew fast sew easy great super best diy poor instruction recommended professor fantastic machine helpful sewing shop             Things To Do Nearby Sew Fast Sew Easy Inc Restaurants  Hotels  Bars  Movie Theaters  Department Stores    Shopping & Malls  Grocery Stores  Pharmacies  Florists  Banks       Advertisement       Lists In Manhattan    New York Holiday Gift Guide   by  Justine Goodman       Restaurants and Takeout for Thanksgiving in New York  by  Justine Goodman       New York's Best Cheap Eats  by  Justine Goodman          More local lists              Create a list          Recent Reviews In Manhattan        Grand Central Optical  369 Madison Ave ,  New York ,  NY           Jacquelyn Wigs  15 W 37th St Fl 4 ,  New York ,  NY           The Yarn Company  2274 Broadway ,  New York ,  NY      Advertisement        Manhattan Neighborhoods  To Do in Manhattan  Manhattan Services    New York RSS Feeds   Twitter and Facebook Directory    More Info About Citysearch  Press Center  Careers  Privacy Policy  Terms of Use  Help    Sign up for our Local Newsletter  Mobile Applications  U.S. City Guides  Best of Citysearch  Directory & Services  Other Cities       Contact Contact Us  Site Feedback  Advertise With Us  Become a CityGrid Publisher  Merchant MyAccount   More Navigation Mobile  Hotels  Shopping  Movies  Events  Directory & Services     Change         Partner Sites: Ask Kids  - Bloglines  - Expedia  - Hotels  - Hotwire  - Insider Pages  - MerchantCircle  - Reference  - The Daily Beast  - Thesaurus  - Urbanspoon   © 2011.
