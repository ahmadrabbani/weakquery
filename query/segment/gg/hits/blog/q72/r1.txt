The incentives that President George Bush signed into law, as part of The Energy Policy Act of 2005, had granted up to $3,400 as a tax credit for the most efficient hybrid cars—and $4,000 for a compressed natural gas vehicle. They are gone, with little prospects for returning. Instead, legislators have jumped to the next technology breakthrough: tax credits for plug-in hybrids and electric cars. A combination of local and national credits—up to $7,500 at the federal level, plus a $2,000 credit for charging equipment installation, plus state-based incentives (of $5,000 in California)— represent so far the largest bundle of incentives ever for private purchasers of green electric-drive vehicles. With hybrids remaining below 3 percent of the new car market, some green car advocates wonder if the hybrid tax credits have vanished too soon. But Mike Stanton, president and CEO of the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, summed up the situation, in an interview with   Detroit News  . "The intent was to provide an incentive for new technology,” Stanton said. “Hybrid technology is now pretty well-known."  Training Wheels Come Off At this stage, the viability of steady growth of the hybrid car market—as well as so-called “clean diesel” vehicles and cars that run on compressed natural gas—will have to stand on its merits, with no assistance from federal tax credits. In fact, for the most popular hybrids, the tax incentives have been long gone—because The Energy Policy Act of 2005 called for a phase-out of tax credits when any specific automaker sold more than 60,000 hybrid or clean-tech vehicles. Toyota and Lexus hybrids became ineligible in September 2007. Honda lost its eligibility on Jan. 1, 2009, and Ford's expired March 31, 2010. Many observers believed the 60,000-vehicle threshold was designed to limit the advantage for Japanese automaker, such as Toyota (and some degree Honda), which dominated the hybrid market since its introduction more than 10 years ago. With American companies very much in the plug-in game, the new incentives for plug-in cars have a bigger limit of 200,000 cars. Other perks, such as the ability for solo drivers to use carpool lanes, have also shifted from conventional hybrids to plug-in cars—although California hybrid drivers with yellow stickers had their HOV privileges extended until June 30, 2011. Then, cars with yellow stickers are out, and those with white ones—for zero emission vehicles—take their place in the carpool lanes.  California issued yellow carpool lane access stickers to 85,000 hybrids between 2004 and 2007. To alleviate concerns about highway congestion from solo green car drivers, there will be a cap of 40,000 for Enhanced AT-PZEV plug-in hybrids allowed in the HOV lanes. There is currently no limit set for the number of all-electric, or zero emission vehicles, that can receive white HOV access stickers. Speeding Up Adoption of Electric Cars Support for electric car incentives is apparently accelerating. There are multiple proposals to enhance the $7,500 tax credit for electric cars to an instant rebate available at the time of purchase. This would help avoid EV shoppers not being able to claim the full credit when it comes to tax time—a common problem when hybrid shoppers lost some of the value of their credits due to the Alternative Minimum Tax. As it stands now, buyers of plug-in hybrids and electric cars benefit from a tax credit of $2,500 to $7,500, depending on the size of the battery in the car. On the low end of the spectrum, cars with 4 kWh battery packs will qualify for a $2,500 tax credit. The credit maxes out at $7,500 for cars with a 16 kWh battery pack, like the  Chevy Volt . Drivers converting a car into a plug-in hybrid, or a gas-powered car into an electric vehicle, will receive a tax credit equal to 10 percent of the conversion cost. The maximum credit is $4,000 for a $40,000 conversion. The credits were provided as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, otherwise known as the “stimulus bill.”  In late Dec. 2010, the federal government saved the tax credit for installation of home-based charging equipment that was set to expire at the end of 2010. It was a bittersweet victory, because the amount of the credit dropped from 50 percent to 30 percent. EV buyers can now claim a credit of 30 percent of the purchase and costs of the charging equipment, up to $1,000 for individuals and $30,000 for businesses. The new rules are in effect until December 31, 2011. There is a long  list of incentives for electric cars and plug-in hybrids at the state level . We will track those incentives—to the best of our available, things are changing fast—on our sister site, PluginCars.com.

Ford hybrids were cut in half from amounts listed above starting April 1, 2009. In October 2009, the credits were cut in half again, and completely ended on April 1, 2010.   The basic rules: The vehicle must be placed in service after 12/31/05 and purchased on or before 12/31/10. The original use of the vehicle must begin with the taxpayer claiming the credit. The credit may only be claimed by the original owner of a new, qualifying, hybrid vehicle and does not apply to a used hybrid vehicle. The vehicle must be acquired for use or lease by the taxpayer claiming the credit. The credit is only available to the original purchaser of a qualifying hybrid vehicle. If a qualifying vehicle is leased to a consumer, the leasing company may claim the credit. For qualifying vehicles used by a tax-exempt entity, the person who sold the qualifying vehicle to the person or entity using the vehicle is eligible to claim the credit, but only if the seller clearly discloses in a document to the tax-exempt entity the amount of credit. The vehicle must be used predominantly within the United States.   These rules are relatively straight-forward. But there's more — and these are more foggy: The credit amount is based on the purchase date of the vehicle.  The new law for the hybrid tax credit might require taxpayers to recapture their hybrid tax credit if they re-sell their hybrid car or truck.   Surprisingly, for taxpayers who take a lot of deductions or use the Alternative Minimum Tax, the previous tax deduction (which bit the dust in 2005) was more valuable. Details: The credit will not reduce your alternative minimum tax, if that applies to you. As stated in Toyota's statement about the new tax credits: "The benefit of the hybrid vehicle tax credit will also be substantially reduced or eliminated if the individual purchaser is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax." The credit will reduce your regular income tax liability, but not below zero. If you are eligible for multiple tax credits, the hybrid tax credit is taken last after all the other credits (e.g., child care tax credit, mortgage credit, retirement savings credit) have been taken. Any tax liability left over by these reductions will be the maximum dollar limit of your hybrid tax credit. If your hybrid tax credit exceeds your maximum dollar limit, the excess is not refundable, and is lost forever.  The excess cannot be carried over to another year, or given away to another person.   As you might guess, it's a good idea to get advice from a tax professional before filing.           Timmy   39 weeks ago   Hybrids better than electrics?

This is non-sense especially for diesel vehicles that pollute the air with carcinogenic particulate matter." News flash Priusmaniac , your precious Prius emits particles. In fact, I've heard there is some speculation that gasoline particles may in fact be worse than diesel's because they're smaller and easier to inhale. Even if they're not you are totally uninformed on the current state of diesel emissions... very clean now. On topic, I've never much liked these Incentives. I see no reason why I as a taxpayer should foot the bill for somebody else's luxury item. reply  Report this page       Alex J   38 weeks ago   I guess that depends what angle you're approaching this from, Dom. When it comes to speeding the adoption of technologies that boost long-term efficiency, and helping them achieve economies of scale, such credits could be seen as a good investment. And not in "luxury", but in helping to improve America's 18+ million barrel daily oil consumption, and countering the trend toward unconventional, more carbon-intensive fuels. If we're not going to recognize the externalized costs of fossil hydrocarbons via a carbon pricing and incentive system system, or at least drop Big Oil subsidies, we can at least make the higher up-front cost of alternative technologies more manageable. reply  Report this page       Scott   38 weeks ago   The Government is broke, but they continue to provide incentives for these vehicles. I agree with Dom, why should taxpayers foot the bill so some guy in California can plug his car in? The government has spent billions subsidizing ethanol and look where that has gotten us...higher food prices. If a product can't stand on it's own, it's not our responsibility to make it work. Besides, what is so great about electric vehicles given the fact that much of the electricity is generated by burning coal...the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. reply  Report this page       Alex J   38 weeks ago   What's so great is that electric propulsion with regenerative braking is much more efficient than your typical internal combustion setup. Even with half the electric supply being coal (assuming a full electric or plug-in), it's an improvement over burning oil, especially from tar sands, at low efficiency. And to me it's a much better investment than corn-based ethanol, since it means a faster transition from reliance on oil, and reduction of the national and global risks therein. Not to mention that anything that helps reduce demand benefits the pocketbook as prices rise along with the competition for resources. Otherwise, I'm sure we'll hear lots of Americans complaining when more Chinese and Indians seek to emulate the high-consumption, high-waste Western lifestyle, and drive oil prices through the roof. reply  Report this page       Susan C   37 weeks ago   This posting shows prius is covered in tax credit but when I got to irs site prius is not on the list.

With that being said, The reason we as taxpayer's pay into the government is to fund these goals, because These incentives help bring the cost of a new technology that most people would not see a cost benefit if left to purchase on their own. The overall and end goal is to eventually lower cost of the technology. You do this buy more people buying, this is also why once it reached a certain level the incentives stopped. Taxpayers for the most part pay in to help secure their future. This is just one more step the government is trying to help with that goal in mind.  I doubt this actually convinced you to understand the reasons why the incentives are in place most people have a hard time seeing and understanding the big picture, and this too is ok. reply  Report this page          msmith  Junior Member 35 weeks ago   wow what an article this is a lot of money !  reply  Report this page       Jimbo2620   33 weeks ago   Great then I am sure you are all for the billions of dollars taxpayers subsidize the oil industry who puts up multi-billion dollar profits each quarter but somehow need the taxpayers to support their business. Check the carbon output created in generating the electricity needed to charge the car and compare it to the carbon output on an ICE. No comparison, hands down the EV wins. Let's end all the corporate subsidies.

However, after doing my taxes, I am getting most of my money back due to only working part of the year and real estate tax deductions. Next year I think my income will be higher. Can I wait and take the credit next year? How will someone know I purchased in 06 and not 07?

If we look more closely at electrical cars, we need to see where America gets its electricity. Most of it is from burning oil, coal and gas. This is unfeasible in the long run because changing over from direct fossil fuel insertions to electric cars will not make much difference overall. It may change consumption distributions but not consumption overall. This constant seesawing should stop and hybrid cars should be supported fully. reply  Report this page       C.Savva & Associates ltd   18 weeks ago   Few  international business centres can offer tax advantages similar to those available from the  Cyprus taxation regime , making Cyprus one of the most attractive onshore tax jurisdictions in the world.
