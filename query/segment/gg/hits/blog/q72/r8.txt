Group says EVs are getting preferential treatment When it comes to weaning the U.S. off fossil fuels for automotive use as much as possible, the Obama administration is leaning heavily towards hybrids and  EVs . The new proposed fuel efficiency standards that are likely to be published soon will push fleet wide economy for light trucks and cars to  54.5 mpg by 2025 .    The problem with that for some carmakers is that they will be forced to “go hybrid” to meet that number even if the consumer isn't after hybrid vehicles. Chrysler's CEO recently said he had  no choice  but to push hybrids to meet the proposed economy figures.   While the Obama administration is pushing EVs heavily and the government is investing heavily in the tech there are other alternatives that some are demanding be put on equal ground with EV technology. Specifically, auto suppliers are asking the Obama administration and others in Washington supporting these new economy standards to put diesel and highly efficient gasoline engines on level playing field with EVs and hybrids.      Like the previous generation E90, the F30 BMW 3-Series will be available with a turbocharged inline-6 turbodiesel engine in the U.S.  Along with the auto suppliers that are part of the U.S. coalition for Advanced Diesel Cars, former Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta is pushing for fair treatment. The coalition includes automotive suppliers BorgWarner, Robert Bosch GmbH, Honeywell and Umicore.   The group intends to file public comments to urge the Obama administration to make changes to the proposed standards before finalizing them next year.   Mineta said, "[EVs are] the flavor of the day. It's sort of the fad. People ought to be able to make up their own mind — and they would gravitate to clean diesel."   Mineta also addresses the $7,500 tax credit for EVs saying, "There's a hidden cost to that — that ought not to be borne by the taxpayer." A report penned by Mineta read, "Given the current economy and job market, it is increasingly difficult to justify subsidizing a $41,000 vehicle with a $7,500 rebate when its benefits do not fall on those in the lowest income brackets — those most in need."

They pollute MORE in the end, rely heavily on foreign mining of precious metals, and simply just do not make sense for almost all consumers. They are not a practical choice for a means of transportation, so curb the baby kissing and camera smiling.

Hybrids are the equivalent of sticking your head in the sand, and don't actually solve the oil or pollution problmen. Electric puts more strain on a very badly designed power grid, costing even more energy in the long run. Solar doesn't make sense for vehicles, as does nuclear. That being said, Diesl isn't the answer either. I fully expect oil to spike within the next decade, simply due to declining worldwide production. As such, any energy source that requires oil at any part of its supply chain is simply not a long term solution. Thats why Hydrogen-Fuel Cells are the only solution that makes sense, but the oil companies would NEVER invest in the infrasturcture, and conservatives will never let government do it themselves. Hence sometime a decade or so from now, when we are paying ~$15/Gallon, and our economy is in tatters due to our reliance on oil, remember how we could have done something years ahead of time, but didn't.

Future cities that don't collapse in upon themselves due to high gas prices will be places with super efficient buses, subways, large efficient light-rail, bike routes, and plentiful places to walk to where you need to go. Fighting over whether electric, diesel, regular ICE, hydrogen, hybrid, etc. just proves you really don't understand the problem in it's entirety. If any car system is even close to getting us there it is something like the Chevy Volt that is used 95% of the time on all-electric, gas only in an emergency, which is also used to carry multiple people around at a time, and then re-charged with a diverse combination of renewable energies.

You would never expect either the government nor oil companies to help with distribution infrastructure. But don't give up hope. Example: GA Natural Gas just got the okay to start natural gas distribution in GA with a few stations that WILL BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. There is only ONE station right now open to the public in Atlanta and for the surrounding two or three hundred miles. All other stations are fleet refueling for trucking and government. They voted exactly one week ago, with many people wanting to EXCLUDE the public. But GA Natural Gas got the go-ahead to begin a distribution/refueling system in Georgia, and its about time. As for diesel vs. EV... this group is absolutely right. EV is the scam of the liberal/Democrat coalition designed to halt mobility and round up everyone to urban environments. If your electricity is coming from a coal fired plant... where is the pollution or carbon savings? If your electricity is coming from a natural gas plant, then you give up mobility by charging batteries rather than burning natural gas directly in your own vehicle. The ONLY way EV's make sense is if your electricity is coming from nuclear/solar/wind, and you are charging during off hours. The drawbacks and limitations of EV simply aren't worth a subsidy of tax dollars. Clean diesel, natural gas, hydrogen are THE fuel choices of the future. EV is a fad... a liberal wet dream.

The people can dictate what fuel efficiency they want and at what price from automakers. This isn't the governments job. They should be focusing on safety requirements and environmental standards. Not fuel economy, which is fundementally a 'feature' of the vehicle, so to speak.

The EPA has been against clean Diesels that are the mainstay of most countries of the world, so that tax payer money can be pissed away on pet EV projects. It's such a disgrace. The criminals in DC should all be hung by their thumbs or other attachments...                          Why not diesel hybrids?

Been driving a Jetta TDI for the past six years and average 40+ miles to the gallon and a 500 mile range per tank. Even the Prius has a hard time keeping up with that in real world driving. Seems logical to me to make diesel/EV hybrids. VW, Opel, Mercedes and some others have built prototype Diesel/EV hybrids that test out at 70+ miles per gallon with close to a 900 mile range per tank. Ford makes a 60+ mpg diesel focus but will only sell it in Europe claiming there is no market in America for diesel cars. In the meantime, Audi, VW, BMW, Mercedes have all announced they are going to increase the models and number of diesel cars they will sell in America. What do those companies know that Ford and GM are failing to notice? American car makers are missing the boat and continue to suck the tax payer teet and fail to deliver products the consumer actually wants and would buy. The Chevy Volt is a tax payer subsidized failure and I want my money back!
