1st verse/chorus :
         B7                           E
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
          B7                     E
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
           A                         E
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
               B7               E
Because you're mine, I walk the line

2nd verse/chorus :
          E7                    A 
I find it very, very easy to be true
          E7                         A
I find myself alone when each day is through
            D                  A
Yes, I'll admit I'm a fool for you
               E7               A 
Because you're mine, I walk the line

3rd verse/chorus :
            A7                      D
As sure as night is dark and day is light
           A7                      D
I keep you on my mind both day and night
          G                               D
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
              A7                D
Because you're mine, I walk the line

4th verse/chorus :
             E7                     A
You've got a way to keep me on your side
            E7                        A
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
           D                            A 
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
               E7               A
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
           A                         E
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
               B7               E
Because you're mine, I walk the line
