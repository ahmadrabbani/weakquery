WARNING: You are trying to view

in an unauthorized application,

Please use an official Ultimate
Guitar Tabs application for iPhone,
iPad or Android to access legitimate
chords, guitar, bass, and drum tabs
from Ultimate-Guitar.com database.

Type "ultimate guitar tabs" in Apple
App Store's or Android Market's
search to find the application.  I've seen a few tabs on this site and none are quite right. The intro tab is dead on
and I'll repeat it here.  Play with a capo on the first fret. If you can't sing that
low C then capo up a couple more!

Intro:

e|-----------------------------|------------------------|

Either Johnny or his guitarist continues the two-note shuffle while the chords are:


          B7                             E 
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
           B7                       E 
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
            A                           E 
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
                B7                 E 
Because you're mine, I walk the line


                       A|--------0- 
Then walk up to A....  E|--0-2-4---   etc...

           E7                      A  
I find it very, very easy to be true
           E7                           A 
I find myself alone when each day is through
             D                    A 
Yes, I'll admit I'm a fool for you
                E7                 A  
Because you're mine, I walk the line

                      D|--------0-
Then walk up to D...  A|--0-2-4---   etc...

             A7                        D 
As sure as night is dark and day is light
            A7                        D 
I keep you on my mind both day and night
           G                                 D 
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
               A7                  D 
Because you're mine, I walk the line


                   D|--0--------
Back down to A...  A|----4-2-0--   etc...


              E7                       A 
You've got a way to keep me on your side
             E7                          A 
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
            D                              A  
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
                E7                 A 
Because you're mine, I walk the line


                       A|-0--------
And back to E again... E|---4-2-0--   etc...


          B7                             E 
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
           B7                       E 
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
            A                           E 
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
                B7                 E 
Because you're mine, I walk the line

                 A|-2---2----2---2-----
Then out on....  E|---0----0---0-------  fade
