To buy music is always the best way to support your idols)  Use Google, Yahoo and MSN to find some auido clip sites. Sometimes search engines can direct you to right sites. Now that a lot of auido clip sites are banned by search engines, remember to make good use of exchange links in those sites.   Use auido clip search engines outside the United Stats. I used to use Chinese sites such as Baidu, Sogou, Yahoo China to search audio clips. Your browser maybe ask you to install simplified Chinese character, just ingore it. I always can find tons of English audio clips in those music search engines.   Use P2P software. It works well for full album audio clips specially. In fact, you almost can find everything with P2P software.  Visit artist's offical website. Some artists' sites provide mp3 files for fans to download.
