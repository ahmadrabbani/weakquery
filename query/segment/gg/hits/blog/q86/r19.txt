 Rhymes With Clown: Feingold and Ryan Walk the Line (Item)

                                                  Pages Home  About                                                       Wednesday, March 4, 2009   Feingold and Ryan Walk the Line (Item)    Senator Feingold and Representative Ryan published an  Op-Ed  arguing for a line item veto as a means of curbing government spending. Aside from the potential constitutional issues this type of provision may entail, this initially seemed like a good idea to me. But then there's this: If the president could remove egregious earmarks, we could save billions in taxpayer money.  If the spending is so egregious, then  Congress should stop it . Even if it doesn't rise to the level of egregiousness, but is merely wasteful or simply not useful  Congress should still stop it . For Congress to rely on the president, any president, to save it from its own bad habits is ridiculous and an abdication of its responsibility under our system of government. A Republican, especially, should be wary of reliance on such a scheme. If the federal government is not a cure-all for personal irresponsibility, why would it be such for Congressional irresponsibility. I respectfully suggest that Feingold and Ryan re-examine their position on this issue and then advocate for sensible government spending without calling on the executive to bail them out. It's high time the first branch of government started living up to its billing.    Share  |          Posted by  Jeremy R.

I couldnt disagree more with him on most things but on pork he is spot on. HE'd veto this omnibus bill faster than Speaker Pelosi was jumping from her chair during the President's address to Congress.    March 5, 2009 1:30 PM             Steve said...  The Arizona Republic also listed the pork that Arizona legilators (basically Pastor, Mitchell, and Grihalva (Dems)are requesting to be included in the bill. Most of it is for light rail extension. On a bill such as this and at a time such as this I cannot see any justification for this kind of action by any congressman. Makes me ashamed to be a democrat. Shame on these congressmen!

How much did they reduce government during their ownership of the Congress and Executive branches?    March 8, 2009 10:09 PM               Jeremy R. Shown said...  Joe You're right about the Republicans, but what do we do? Vote for Ron Paul? I don't have the answer to this, so if you do, let me know.
