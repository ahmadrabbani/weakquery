Loğoğlu has condemned Sunday’s attack on a Turkish consulate in Syria, but believes that Turkey must not escalate its rhetoric against Damascus.     Turkey’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), which has so far refused to condemn the Syrian regime over its ongoing crackdown on civilians, has found itself in a difficult situation with regards to its policy on Syria after pro-regime protestors in the neighboring country attacked Turkish diplomatic missions and burnt the Turkish flag.      The party on Monday condemned the attacks that took place on Saturday but this move comes despite the party’s long standing refusal to condemn the Syria regime. Faruk Loğoğlu, CHP’s deputy chairman in charge of foreign relations, said the attacks were a big mistake on the part of Syria, calling on the government to refrain from using threatening language and from taking sides in Syria’s internal conflicts. “When you keep this discourse, one day you might find yourself in armed conflict with Syria. There is no reason for Turkey to get into conflict with Syria today,” he said at a press conference he held on Monday. Loğoğlu, who visited Damascus in the first week of September with a group of CHP deputies and met also with Bashar al-Assad, called on the Asad regime to find and punish the people responsible for the attack, noting that the embassy’s property is considered Turkish soil. Loğoğlu’s commendation is a rare exception of the CHP’s cautious stance on Syria, which has seen the party calling for continued dialogue even as rising casualties and a recalcitrant regime have alienated the West, Turkey and the Arab League. Last month saw the visit of CHP’s deputy-chairman Birgül Ayman Güler and a delegation of women to Damascus, a move which created some doubts as to whether the CHP might be “supporting” the Assad regime. Güler at the time condemned the treatment Assad had received in the international community, stating: “We see the Western media has not given accurate information about what is happening in Syria. We said ‘let’s go and see for ourselves’.” Loğoğlu says the visit did not aim to support the regime in Syria, telling Today’s Zaman that the CHP never intended to give support to a violent regime. “What we are concerned about is Syria and the Syrian people,” he said. Loğoğlu stressed that the CHP is of the opinion that Assad should leave power, and that Syria has wasted an opportunity by failing to act in accordance with the agreement it had concluded with the Arab League, but added: “It’s wrong for the Turkish government to support only the opposition in Syria while totally excluding the regime in power. If Assad is to leave power, this should be in accordance with the internal dynamics of Syria and Turkey should act as a mediator between the regime and the opponents to establish an environment for a meaningful dialogue just as the Arab League intended to do.” Loğoğlu is fearful that Syria might be drifting into a civil war, a situation which he believes Turkey not only has a duty to prevent, but also which could potentially harm Turkey as a neighboring country. Aytuğ Atıcı, a CHP member in the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs, finds it wrong to make an evaluation of the relations between Turkey and Syria based on a single event like the attacks on the Turkish Embassy. Atıcı, who authored the report prepared after the CHP’s visit to Damascus in September, also asserts, referring to claims that the CHP acts in “support” of the Assad regime, that: “[The] CHP has never adopted an attitude of protecting the Syrian regime and expressed that it was on the side of the Syrian people.” Granting that the Assad regime was oppressive and has resorted to violence and that this was inacceptable, Atıcı labeled the problem in Syria as “a problem of not being able to democratize itself.” The CHP, who considers the events surrounding Syria a part of an international conspiracy in which big world powers are involved, believes that the disorder in Syria has been exaggerated by the media. Atıcı is also against the presentation of the turmoil in Syria as a sectarian one. “The men on the street in Syria, both those supporting the regime and the opponents, say it [sectarian conflict] is not the case and that they are trying to inject a sectarian problem in Syria,” he adds.                    Post your comments  / Share your thoughts      Display Name (What's this)  Your e-mail address         Comment (Required) Characters Remaining:             Enter the following code: Refresh               Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.
