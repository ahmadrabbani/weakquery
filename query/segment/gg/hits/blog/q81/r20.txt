 My Daily Trek: Flag burning @USA Embassy 9-11 anniversary UK - Extremist Muslims

                                   My Daily Trek   Conservative Christian and a die-hard Trekkie.... LIVE LONG AND PROSPER!                                                          Monday, September 12, 2011   Flag burning @USA Embassy 9-11 anniversary UK - Extremist Muslims      Unbelievable. That's all I can say.  The protest was done during a one minute moment of silence in remembrance of all 9/11 victims.  Those people have absolutely no respect. And shame on the British police.

The only thing stupider than the West's relationship with the Middle East is the Middle East's relationship with us. JMJ    September 12, 2011 11:24 PM                MK said...  Oh that's just the more tolerant and loving side of muslims people, you all are just not nuanced enough to get it. /sarc    September 13, 2011 1:29 AM                Always On Watch said...  Pity that the authorities didn't open fire on these Islamomaniacs.    September 13, 2011 4:31 AM                Silverfiddle said...  Here's something even stupider, Jersey:  That we open our gates to uncivilized cockroaches who hate us, and then provide them a state to spew out their filthy hatred against us.

Debbie, I hate to agree, but I am afraid you might right about that. Angel, I know. But it's hard to watch. JMJ, for once you and I are in full agreement. Those poor people weren't allowed to mourn in peace. MK, looking at that video, I would some eyes were open. AOW, at least they could have hosed them down or moved them to a different location, but no the mourners were harassed asked to leave. *shaking head* Silver, "stupider", ignorant, the list could go on. It is infuriating.    September 13, 2011 2:13 PM               Bd said...  So glad you were able to find something to hate about, lol    September 13, 2011 8:57 PM                Leticia said...  bd, only you would find humor about this information. Tell me, do you possess a heart at all for your fellow man, or do find contempt in everyone that you meet or communicate with? How do you live with yourself? I pray that God Almighty touches your heart and fills it with love and compassion.

September 14, 2011 1:49 PM                Jersey McJones said...  I've been saying that for years, Silver. We should be extremely careful about allowing immigration from the Arabian Peninsula, parts of North Africa, and some other places. But they have something over us, and we're too drooling stupid to get off it. So, we just keep up that love affair with the stupid internal combustion engine, and then we can look in the mirror and see just who are making it easy for these people to get in here.

September 15, 2011 7:57 AM                Leticia said...  JMJ, I believe that our government should profile people from those specific countries that are primarily Islam. So, what if he offend a few of them. No could possibly blame us for wanting to protect our borders and her people.    September 15, 2011 2:36 PM                Teresa said...  Choudary and his gang certainly qualifies as Muslim extremists.  Silver, this is why need secure borders. I'm sorry but profiling should be on the table.
