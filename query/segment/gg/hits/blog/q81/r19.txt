Now at the time I just thought this was really stupid. For one thing I don't think the New Zealand flag can really be argued to represent either of those. The union jack part perhaps but not the whole thing. Victoria University has now suspended them for this trimester however meaning they will be unable to complete their papers for it. I understand that they should be punished for endangering health and safety in general although in the circumstances they did it the risks were low they were still there and the University should be seen as not tolerating unsafe things like setting fire to things with and accelerant on university property etc... It seems a bit over the top though. It puts all the work those students put into their last few months to waste and means that they are all significantly out of pocket now and will also have to spend an extra half year at university to get their degree. I think it would have been far more fitting had they merely been fined and given a lecture, the university shouldn't be doling out such harsh punishments for this I cant help but think it is mostly because it was a flag that they were burning.
