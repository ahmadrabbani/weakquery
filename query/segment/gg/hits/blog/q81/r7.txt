(AP) — A planned American flag burning at LSU ended before it started when about 1,000 LSU students and other protesters forced police to intervene. The Advocate reports LSU graduate student Benjamin Haas had originally planned to burn an American flag Wednesday to promote his First Amendment rights and to support an LSU student arrested last week for stealing and burning a flag. When Haas finally arrived to a chaotic scene, he was surrounded by a large crowd yelling obscenities and chanting, "U-S-A" and "Go to hell hippie, go to hell." Police say horse-mounted offices escorted Haas out for his own safety to a police car as the crowd followed and he was driven off. He was not arrested. ___ Information from: The Advocate, http://www.2theadvocate.com Print  print   Email Email  this article    Share Tweet  Facebook    Share Share!

What, so anything other than a Tulane degree is worthless? Whatever you say buddy. And a big shout out to Tiger Town, thanks for stopping this little loser from getting any more attention. I swear, I almost feel like we should make a law against flag burning. Then of course, someone will make the correlation that no flag burning is taking away more of our rights.. yada yada. There needs to be some regulation in this country. Without any regulations.. well, then.... just ask investment bankers and everyone in the financial crisis just how well no regulations have helped our country, and a lot of the world. Time to get realistic. 66950772 Flag this comment  besaved_316 said on May 12, 2011 at 1:30 PM Just another reason Gov. Jindal should close this underachieving school. We, the LA. taxpayers are paying to educate hippies, terrorists, and future gas station attendants. An LSU degree is worthless in the real world. Balancing the budget is the absolute priority. If someone wants to make this school private, hire intelligent educators, and stop the wasteful backing by La. taxpayers, then so be it. But the best option is to get rid of "schools" like this UNO, Nicholls St, and Southern. If your kid isn't smart enough to go to a real college, or you can't afford to send him to college on your own dime, do us TAXPAYERS a favor, and stop asking us to pay for your child's education. And as to the un-American flag burner, I hope you burn in Hades with your comrade in arms Bin Laden. 66943582 Flag this comment  usmarine said on May 12, 2011 at 11:49 AM Let the crowd handle this little punk.....this is not free speech .....this is an idiot looking for attention and man.... now he got it.....if ever i see someone disrespect the flag i will exercise MY FREEDOM OF SPEECH... to put my foot thru your forehead..... peace.....lol 66936472 Flag this comment  peabus said on May 12, 2011 at 11:18 AM HAAS, YOU DONT LIKE IT HERE?
