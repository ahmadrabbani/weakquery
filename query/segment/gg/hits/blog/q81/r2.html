      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">"Symbolic
expression" is
a phrase often used to describe expression that is mixed with elements
of conduct.&nbsp; The Supreme Court has made clear in a series of cases
that symbolic expression (or expressive conduct) may be protected by
the
First Amendment.&nbsp; Several of these cases have been highly
controversial--perhaps
none more so than <i>Texas vs Johnson</i> (1990) reversing the
conviction
of a man who expressed his strong displeasure with U. S. policy by
burning
an American flag.</font></font></b>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">It was a case
involving
the burning of another symbol, however, in which the Supreme Court
announced
the test it would use to analyze expressive conduct cases.&nbsp; Paul
O'Brien's
burning of his draft card led to his conviction for the "knowing
destruction
or mutilation" of a draft card.&nbsp; The Supreme Court, over only one
dissent, affirmed O'Brien's conviction, but in so doing offered a test
that would later be used to protect other protesters.&nbsp;
Specifically,
the Court said that a law regulating expressive conduct would be upheld
only if it furthered an important governmental objective unrelated to
the
suppression of speech, was narrowly tailored to achieve the
government's
legitimate objective, and the law left open ample alternative means for
expression.&nbsp; In O'Brien's case, the Court found the law to be
narrowly
tailored to its important objective of "smooth and efficient
functioning
of the selective service system."&nbsp; (Many commentators were
critical
of the Court's decision, arguing that the law was really an attempt to
suppress a dramatic form of anti-war speech.)</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Daniel Schact,
who performed
an anti-war skit at Houston's draft center while wearing a military
uniform,
had better luck in 1970 in reversing his conviction for wearing a
military
uniform in a production other than one that "does not tend to discredit
that armed force."&nbsp; The Court found that the statute used to
prosecute
Schact made an impermissible content-based distinction and violated the
First Amendment.</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">A few years
later, Harold
Spence, a young Seattle resident, was prosecuted under
a state flag "improper use" law for hanging a flag in his
apartment&nbsp;
window
with a peace symbol attached to it.&nbsp; The Court rejected the
state's
argument that promoting respect for the flag or preserving the flag as
a symbol of the nation constituted important governmental interests
unrelated
to the suppression of speech, and reversed Spence's conviction.</font></font></b>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Finally, the
Court addressed
the highly emotional issue of flag burning.&nbsp; In <i>Texas vs
Johnson</i>,
it reversed Gregory Johnson's conviction for burning an American flag
during
the 1984 Republican National Convention.&nbsp; The Court concluded that
the flag burning was "speech" and again determined that the flag
desecration
statute was aimed at the communicative impact of Johnson's
message.&nbsp;
The Court noted, however, that speech-neutral laws, such as those
applicable
to public burning generally, might be constitutionally applied against
flag burners.&nbsp; The next term the Court again confronted the flag
burning
issue, this time to consider the constitutionality of the Federal Flag
Protection Act of 1989, passed by a Congress unhappy with the Court's
decision
in <i>Johnson</i>.&nbsp; The Court again ruled for the protester, a
man
who set fire to a flag on the steps of the U. S. Capitol, finding that
the act was an attempt to suppress unpopular speech.&nbsp; The Court's
decisions in the flag burning cases has led to numerous attempts to
pass
a constitutional amendment authorizing punishment of flag burning and
mutilation,
but so far the proposed amendment has fallen short of the two-thirds
support
necessary in the Senate.</font></font></b></p>

      </center>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">1. Was the Court too
quick to
dismiss the expressive elements of O'Brien's burning of his draft
card?&nbsp;
Was he engaged in "speech" for First Amendment purposes?</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">2.&nbsp; How
substantial
do you think the government's interest are in prohibiting the
destruction
of draft cards?</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">3.&nbsp; The Court
notes
that in the 1965 floor debates on the draft-card destruction law, only
three members of Congress offered their reasons for supporting the
legislation
(all three noted draft-card burning demonstrations and were critical of
those demonstrations).&nbsp; What if dozens, or even hundreds, of
legislators
indicated that they were supporting the legislation at least in part
because
of their unhappiness with anti-war demonstrations?</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">4. If the law
provided no
exception for theatrical productions that portrayed the military in a
favorable
light, could Schact have been constitutionally convicted under a
statute
prohibiting the wearing of military uniforms by non-military
personnel?&nbsp;</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">5. Should the United
States
adopt an anti-flag burning amendment to the Constitution?&nbsp; Why or
why not?</font></font> <br>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">6.&nbsp; Why does
burning
of the flag seem to provoke such an emotional reaction in so many
people?&nbsp;
Could flag burning laws be justified as an attempt to prevent breaches
of the peace?&nbsp; Why or why not?</font></font> </td>
