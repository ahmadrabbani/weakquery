(AP) -- An American flag was hauled down and burned early Monday at Louisiana State University, but students and campus officials are uncertain whether it was connected to the U.S. hunting down and killing Osama bin Laden.  The LSU Police Department declined to comment on the investigation, but Cpt. William Conger, an assistant professor of military science and graduate student, says a suspect has been identified. A joint forces coalition of ROTC cadets volunteered to temporarily replace the flags with those used by the battalion on campus. The cadets, representing all of the military branches, are protecting the temporary flag in rotating shifts. Conger found the burned flag, along with two matches and what appeared to be a model rocket engine, at the war memorial at roughly 5:45 a.m. The state flag was wrapped up the cable and the LSU flag was missing, said Conger. He was conducting physical training with the cadets when someone told him that the flag had been cut down from the pole and was burning. The cable contains metal in order to support the large, ceremonial flag, which hangs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at the war memorial on the parade grounds. "You can't just take a knife and cut that cable, and when I found it someone had definitely been working on that cable to break it and get it down," Conger said. When Conger turned the evidence over to the police, they informed him that there was a suspect who was not yet in custody, he said. He spoke at noon at a rally organized by David Jones II, an LSU student. Jones and Conger condemned the flag burning in comments to the roughly 100 students in attendance, but called for a peaceful response. They and others were eager to dispel stereotypes that some students had of the suspect or motive for the act. "They felt that it had to have been someone of a descent from a Middle Eastern (or) Muslim kind of background," he said. Students interviewed by The Associated Press said they have not observed any increasing opposition to America, the military or President Barack Obama on campus recently. Jones declined to give his opinion on whether the flag burning was related to the death of bin Laden. "This was just kind of out of left field," he said. "First the news that we received roughly 10, 10:30 last night, and then this information that I received early this morning that relatively happened around 5:45 a.m. It's just been a whirlwind of activity." Conger said that although flag burning is behavior protected by the Constitution as freedom of speech, in this case a crime has occurred. "This is a legal issue in the sense that it was university property, and what that does is compound the fact that it was the national colors," he said. LSU spokesman Ernie Ballard said the flag would be permanently placed Tuesday evening. The burned flag will either be memorialized or properly destroyed, Conger said.  (Copyright 2011 by The Associated Press.

This issue was decided by the Supreme Court! I wish you all would stop trying to bend the truth. O'bama had/has nothing to do with allowing the flag to be burned. When you try to distort the truth, you only make AMERICA weaker ....not STRONGER! 66298442 Flag this comment  agape said on May 3, 2011 at 10:11 AM What if I wanted to burn a qur'an that I owned? The fed gov would call that an act of disrespect yet anyone can burn a Bible and nothing happens. US gov just burned all Bibles from the military calling it trash because they didn't want any one trying to distribute it to anyone in Afganistan, Iran, or Iraq. But if you handle the qur'an, you must wear gloves, not set it next to a toilet, floor, and other things. obama said this is no longer a Christian nation and is backing it up with his religion - islam. Burning a symbol that represents the shed blood, deaths, and freedom should be a felony offense. I dare anyone to go to Iraq, Iran, Afganistan and burn the Flag while they stand in the middle of the soldiers. America better wake up! The enemy is among us and obama is leading them to gain control little by little. obama praises allah, not our Christian God, he quotes from the quran not the Bible. Is that a Christian or muslim? I hope they catch the person who burned the Flag! 66285406 Flag this comment  rnav98 said on May 3, 2011 at 9:36 AM GO CADETS!

This person, instead of burning the flag, should respect the flag because if not for those men and women over there fighting, we would not have the right to "protest" (if that is what they consider burning a symbol of our freedom). I hope that they determine who did this and take something that means a lot to them and burn it-- so they can see how those of us who appreciate the freedoms we have felt when we saw the burnt flag. They probably feel they were speaking out against the government, but what they did was take a piece of each and every one of us TRUE citizens. especially those of us who served (or are currently serving) in our military (to protect their rights and freedoms) and slapped each and every one of us in the face with this cowardly act. 66271172 Flag this comment  candyland said on May 3, 2011 at 2:21 AM I wouldn't be afraid to pass it on anyone now days. It is totally wrong no matter who is responsible. 66265841 Flag this comment  bogalusan said on May 2, 2011 at 10:23 PM If the perpetrator is an LSU student, then I hope the school expels that person. If the flag burner is not a student, I hope s/he is required to purchase a new flag to replace the burned one and to purchase a new cable as well. While some people believe that burning an American flag is protected free speech, vandalism should NEVER be condoned. If the person wanted to make a statement against the US by burning an American flag, then s/he should have purchased one for burning purposes. It would not surprise me to learn that the person behind this was an LSU student not of Middle Eastern descent, but someone who thought it would be cute to make it look like the flag burning was done by someone from the Middle East. 66261421 Flag this comment            Sign Out  Profile    Mobile  RSS Feeds  Special Offers  Newsletters  Twitter  Facebook        News Video   Court accountant makes $661,000, but records can't account for hours, pay   add to reading list         Crash closes I-10 west   add to reading list         JPSO commander demoted after checking stepson out of jail   add to reading list       Occupy NOLA protestors stage sit-in at council meeting   add to reading list       Report says city could save millions by consolidating courts   add to reading list         More Videos |  More News Videos   Most Popular Most Viewed  Most Emailed   Girl persevered through rare, painful medical condition      New Orleans best reviewed restaurants      Napoleon: N.O.'s best boudin  Photos: 'Sexiest Men Alive' 1985-2011     Mackie: Top 5 foods for women    Doctors say hormone diet not safe if done incorrectly      Girl persevered through rare, painful medical condition      Crews moving McDonogh 11, largest structure to ever be moved in La.
