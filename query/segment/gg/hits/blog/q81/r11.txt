 Flag Burning: Desecrate, Burn the American Flag Online

 Hey  love people not money , OK?   Burning This Flag Says: (choose one)  Free speech!  We Need a New System  I Dislike the President  America Lights Up My Life  My Government Misrepresents Me  Nothing (mere physical reaction)  Retire Worn-out Flag  Personal    I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man. Thomas Jefferson (slave-owner)  Being a true American... ...is about the ideals you live, not the team you root for. One of the most American values is the right of the people to criticize their government--to challenge it, and to replace it if we wish. Our nation was founded by people acting on those rights. Burning the flag can symbolize that right of the people to own their government.  The goal of this page is not to promote any one interpretation of the flag (or its burning). The only promotion is of free speech and sharp debate. Defending the right to burn a flag does not imply disrespect for those who see the flag as a symbol of the people rather than the government. To the contrary, the point is that all people have a right to their own interpretations, and to act on those beliefs. The point is invidividual liberty.  "If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth produced by its collision with error."
