<h4>I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility
against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.</h4>
<p>
Thomas Jefferson (slave-owner)
</p>
<hr>

<h4>Being a true American...</h4> ...is about the ideals you live, not the
team you root for. One of the most American values is the right of the
people to criticize their government--to challenge it, and to replace it
if we wish. Our nation was founded by people acting on those rights.
Burning the flag can symbolize that right of the people to own their
government. <p>

The goal of this page is not to promote any one
interpretation of the flag
(or its burning). The only promotion is of free speech and
sharp debate. Defending the right
to burn a flag does not imply disrespect for those who see the flag as a symbol of the people rather than the
government. To the contrary, the point is that all people have a right to
their own interpretations, and to act on those
beliefs. The point is invidividual liberty.

opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error
for truth; if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the
clearer perception and livelier impression of truth produced by its
collision with error.&quot; </p><p> John Stuart Mill. <u>On Liberty</u>.
