  <h2><i>A Brief History<br>

  of Flag Burning</i></h2>

  <blockquote>

    <i><font SIZE="+1"><p align="center">&quot;The words of the first amendment are simple and

    majestic: `Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech.` The proposed

    constitutional amendment would undermine that fundamental liberty.&quot;</p></font></i>

    </blockquote>

  </blockquote>

  <p>In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in favor of the rights of Gregory Johnson, who

  had been convicted of violating a Texas law by burning a U.S. Flag. In response to this

  and a similar 1990 Supreme Court decision, the U.S. Congress attempted to pass an

  amendment to the U.S. Constitution, granting the states the right to pass such laws,

  regardless of the previous decisions of the Supreme Court. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;The Supreme Court, you see, considers burning the American Flag an act which is

  protected by the First Amendment right to free speech. The only way Congress could make

  such anti-flag-desecration laws pass constitutional muster is to amend the very document

  that protects our rights. The bill, thank goodness, was rejected by just 34 votes on June

  21, 1990. Tragically, the Conservative majority in the 104th Congress took it upon itself

  to reintroduce this piece of time-wasting legislative garbage two years ago. With all the

  problems facing America right now, it's hard to imagine how 252 Representatives and 50

  Senators found the time to sign this legislation and push to change our Constitution to

  eliminate this form of expression which the Supreme Court of America has upheld. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;This bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 6-28-95, by a vote of

  312-120. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;It was sent to the Senate, where it needed a 2/3 majority (66 votes) to pass. On

  12-12-95, the amendment was defeated when it failed by only 3 votes. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;Most of us breathed a sigh of relief, thinking the fight was over. And then, on

  2-13-97, Rep Solomon (R-NY) introduced it again, to the 105th Congress. And this time, it

  came pre-signed -- with 201 co-sponsors. </p>

  <p>The bill was killed in the Senate, which did not vote on it before recessing. </p>

  <p>And then, it was re-introduced in the 106th Congress.&nbsp; Again, it

  passed the House, but came just short of passage in the Senate.&nbsp; This

  pattern is likely to continue until enough citizens tell their Congressmen to

  stop re-introducing this legislation.</p>

  <p>For a more in-depth (and accurate) chronology of this legislation, please see <a

  HREF="chronlog.html">The Chronology of Flag Burning</a>, as prepared by the Emergency

  Committee to Stop the Flag Amendment and Laws. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;I have prepared a table of <a HREF="votes.html">the voting record from the 104th

  Congress</a>, so you can find out how your Reps voted. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;There is also a detailed <a HREF="legistry.html">Legislative history</a> of the

  House and Senate versions of the bill, in case you're interested. It includes the full

  text of the legislation. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;By popular demand (and in order to provide the most comprehensive resource on

  flag desecration) I've obtained several government documents, Supreme Court decisions, and

  legal briefs. As I get these HTML-ifyed, I'll be posting them here. 
  <ul>

    <li>U.S. Code on Flag Burning - also known as the <a HREF="protection.html">Flag Protection

      Act of 1989</a></li>

    <p>The full text of the Supreme Court decisions in </p>

    <li><a HREF="texasvjohnson.html">Texas V. Johnson 491 U.S. 397 (1989)</a> (There is an <a href="http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/379/audioresources" target="_blank">audio transcript available via Oyez.org</a>)
      <p>in which the

      Supreme Court upheld a Texas court decision that Gregory Johnson's conviction for flag

      desecration was unconstitutional. Importantly, the Supreme Court here determined: <ul>

        <li>What Gregory Johnson did (burn the flag) was expressive conduct, protected by the

          Constitution</li>

        <li>Johnson's actions did not constitute &quot;fighting words,&quot;</li>

        <li>Since not all offensive conduct will incite a riot or disturb the peace, the government

          may not outlaw certain types expressive conduct simply because they may have such effects.

          (In Johnson's case, the State admitted that there was &quot;no actual breach of the peace

          occurred at the time of the flagburning or in response to the flagburning.&quot;</li>

        <p>and made the famous quote: </p>

        <li>&quot;If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the

          government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the

          idea itself offensive or disagreeable.&quot;</li>

      </ul>

    </li>

    <li>Here are some other key Supreme Court decisions related to flag desecration.&nbsp;    </li>

  <p>The rest of these speeches are recent pedagogic denouncements of flag burning. Although

  some forward-thinking Congressmen have spoken out recently against the legislation, I haven't found

  their comments on the Internet yet. A long time ago, I had the free time that allowed me to keep updating this page and posting that sort of stuff. I just don't these days -- sorry!
